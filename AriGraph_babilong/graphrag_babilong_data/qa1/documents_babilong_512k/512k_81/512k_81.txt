When other methods fail to give early relief, a
purgative may be needed.Rhubarb, magnesia, calomel, Friedrichshall or
Hunyadi water, given in milk, the compound liquorice powder, the
compound anise {657} powder, are better than the more active
cathartics.[53] Habitual administration of laxatives to children ought
to be regarded as a confession that the case is incurable; it is a last
resort, for which necessity is the only argument.[Footnote 53: The compound anise powder, a non-officinal preparation in
use in Washington, is a convenient form of administration: heavy
calcined magnesia, 360 grs.; rhubarb powdered, 180 grs.; oil of anise,
40 minims; stronger alcohol, one fluidrachm.The bicarbonate or fluid
magnesia is also a good preparation.Ringer knows nothing so effectual
in bringing back the proper consistence and yellow color to the motions
of children as podophyllin.Dissolve one grain of the resin in one
drachm of alcohol, and of this give one or two drops on a lump of sugar
twice or three times a day (_op.Bouchut suggests the
same solution, with simple syrup as a menstruum.]In old persons tonics should be combined with the laxatives, as
strychnia, iron, quinia, gentian with aloes, colocynth, rhubarb, or
podophyllin.The rectum should always be examined, as impacted fecal
masses will often be found there.{658}

ENTERALGIA (INTESTINAL COLIC).BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Enterodynia, Tormina, Colicodynia, Colalgia, Dolor colicus,
Passio colica, Spasmus intestinorum, Ileus spasmodicus, Spasmus
ventriculi, Neuralgia mesenterica; Spasm of the bowels, Cholick or
Cholick Colic, and Pain in the Belly; _Ger._, Das Banchgrimmem, Die
Kolik; _Fr._, La colique.HISTORY.--Colic is described by Hippocrates.[1] He recommended the use
of emetics and gave other sound advice regarding the treatment of the
affection.Galen[2] administered sedatives, as opium and henbane, and
he advised them to be combined with carminatives.Aretaeus[3] speaks of
the pain of colic extending to the back, limbs, and testicles, and also
states that when affecting the sides of the body it may be confounded
with pleurisy, hepatitis, or splenitis.Alexander[4] points out the
differential diagnosis of the disease and directs a proper course of
treatment.Cupping, friction of the extremities, and dry fomentations
were recommended by Celsus;[5] and internally he advocated a mixture of
poppy, anise, pepper, etc.Aetius[6] describes the affection.Serapion[7] and Avicenna[8] treated of colic more clearly than any
previous writers had done, and advised narcotics administered by the
mouth and rectum.Atony of the bowels is given as a cause of the
disease by Haly Abbas,[9] and Alsaharavius adds[10] to the etiology a
hot intemperament, indurated feces, and poisonous medicines.Rhazes[11]
directs the administration of emetics when the colic is due to
indigestion.[Footnote 1: _De Affect._, xv.][Footnote 5: _Medicina_, Libri octo, iv.[Footnote 9: _Pract._, vii.[Footnote 10: _Ibid._, xvii.NATURE AND DEFINITION.--Enteralgia is the name given to intestinal pain
which is independent of indigestion and of inflammation or other
organic change in the wall of the bowel, and corresponds to gastralgia
and other visceral neuralgias.It involves the nerves which pass to the
intestine along the line of attachment of the mesentery, and which are
derived from the superior mesenteric plexus, with a prolongation from
the junction of the right pneumogastric nerve with the coeliac
plexus.[12]

[Footnote 12: The very extensive distribution of terminal
nerve-filaments in the intestine is an explanation of the frequency and
severity of attacks of intestinal pain."We may form some estimate of
the extent to which the nervous system of the intestines is developed
from the fact that about one hundred ganglia belonging to the submucous
and over two thousand to the myenteric plexus are to be found in one
square inch of the intestine of the rabbit" (Frey, _Histology_, New
York, 1875, p.{659} The pain of enteralgia is not spasmodic, and is not accompanied
by flatulence, borborygmi, or other signs of indigestion and gaseous
distension of the bowels.Colic, on the other hand, applies to intestinal pain accompanied by
indigestion, distension of the bowel with gas, or the contact of
irritating ingesta.The pain is spasmodic, and is relieved by the
passage of gas and other contents from the bowel.The pain is due to
the local irritation of the richly-gangliated plexus of nerves seated
in the submucous layer and which extends from the pylorus to the anus.At present enteralgia must be considered from its symptoms and from
post-mortem examinations as a pure neurosis of the sympathetic system.Opportunities are rarely offered for studying the post-mortem
appearances of the disease, from the fact that when idiopathic it
seldom ends fatally.Out of forty-nine autopsies on patients who had
suffered from colic due to lead-poisoning, only one was found with any
change of the abdominal ganglia of the sympathetic.Segoud found the
ganglia and some of the fibres of the sympathetic hypertrophied and
indurated,[13] and "in recent times Kussmaul and Maier have published
an example of sclerosis of the coeliac and superior cervical
ganglia."[14]

[Footnote 13: Segoud, _Essai sur la Nevralgie du Grand Sympathique_,
Paris, 1837.][Footnote 14: M. Rosenthal, "Diseases of the Nervous System," _Wood's
Library_, New York, 1879, vol.The pathology of enteralgia due to a vitiated state of the system, a
morbid condition of the tissues of the intestines, the presence of
irritating ingesta, or to reflexion from other organs, differs in no
wise from a neuralgia of other parts arising from constitutional,
local, or reflex causes.Pain will likewise manifest itself here in
consequence of deleterious substances circulating in the blood, as in
Bright's disease, rheumatism, gout, or lead-poisoning.The terminal
nerve-fibres of the intestines are irritated in attacks of colic by
substances or food within the alimentary canal; gases are generated
from the decomposition of the ingesta.The consequent dilatation of the
gut produces loss of tone and abolition of the contractile power of the
muscular coat.Constipation and pain from pressure exercised on the
neighboring nerves will be the result.Obstinate constipation, and even symptoms resembling ileus, may arise
from a portion of the intestine thus distended becoming bent upon
itself, the sharp angular flexure interrupting or completely
obstructing the passage of the feces.[15]

[Footnote 15: F. H. Hamilton, _Med.Gaz._, New York, 1880, vii.ETIOLOGY.--Enteralgia may be either idiopathic or symptomatic.The
causes can best be considered by dividing them into general and reflex.Under the head of general causes may be mentioned an inherited neurotic
temperament, particularly in individuals of a hypochondriacal tendency.Females are far more apt to suffer from this affection than males, on
account of their more impressionable nature and greater liability to
nervous diseases in general.Hereditary tendencies, overtaxing the
mental powers during the developmental period of youth, and later in
life excessive mental labor and anxiety of business affairs, are
causes.It may occur in the cachexia developed during the course of
many chronic diseases, as diarrhoea, rheumatism, gout, phthisis,
cancer, Bright's disease, etc.Various morbid conditions of the blood
are followed by {660} enteralgia, as anaemia arising from prolonged
lactation, masturbation, or venereal excesses, and the presence of
various blood-poisons, as syphilis, malaria, lead, copper, and arsenic.Other causes are living in cold, damp climates, with sudden changes of
temperature and chilling of the body.Persons addicted to the use of
tobacco or alcohol and to dissipations of various kinds may become
predisposed to enteralgia.Enteralgia is often secondary to ovarian, uterine, or other distant
disease.Also, owing to intimate sympathetic relations, pain is often
felt in the bowels as a result of disease situated in some of the solid
abdominal viscera, as the liver, spleen, and pancreas.In the same way,
organic affections of the brain and spinal cord, especially acute
myelitis and spinal sclerosis and lesions of the vertebral bones,
excite intestinal pain.The
application of cold to the feet or catching cold in general is followed
by pain which is due to reflex influence.There may be a predisposition to colic from hereditary influence and
the neurotic temperament.A feeble digestion is a source of constant
risk.Much of the pain occurring in the course of dysentery, catarrh of
the bowel, invagination, fecal impaction, and other structural
affections is of the nature of colic.The most frequent by far of the
local causes is the direct irritation of the terminal nerve-fibrils by
substances within the alimentary canal and by over-distension of the
bowel with contained gas.Some of these irritants are partly-digested
and indigestible articles of food; food taken cold or in excessive
quantity; the decomposition of food and consequent distension of the
bowel by gas.Acid drinks and alcohol have the same effect.Constipation with scybalae may produce colic in an otherwise healthy
person.A morbid state of the intestinal secretions, either as regards
quantity or quality, is said to have a like result, but this is a
doubtful cause.Foreign bodies within the canal, as fruit-stones,
various concretions, worms, and gall-stones if of large size, may
produce pain during their passage through the bowel.Cathartic
medicines may be enumerated as among the local causes, and also various
poisonous drugs.Lesions of any sort seated in the intestinal wall, as
ulcers and neoplasms, induce paroxysmal pains.SYMPTOMS.--The pain of enteralgia occurs in attacks which come on
slowly and continue for a variable time--some hours or days.The pain
is situated about the umbilicus, and is relieved by deep pressure,
although at the same time there may be hyperaesthesia of the skin.The
intensity of suffering ranges from a dull heavy pain to one which is
acute and lancinating.Retraction of the abdomen is common, but there
may be tympanites.No signs of indigestion may appear, but eructations
of tasteless gas, or even borborygmi, may be complained of.The duration of an attack of enteralgia is variable and depends to a
great extent upon the cause.Usually, when the symptoms are severe, the
duration is short.It may pass off in less than an hour, or a
succession of paroxysms continue to recur, and the attack will be kept
up for several days, weeks, or even a month.One seizure predisposes to
another, and each is liable to be more severe than its predecessor.The malady may end gradually or as rapidly as it was ushered in.Attacks are often mitigated, or even terminated, by the occurrence of
some other morbid condition--by a profuse sweat, the discharge of
lochia, {661} the menses, or some secretion which has been checked.The
development of rheumatism or gout may relieve it.Attacks often
terminate with vomiting, belching, and more especially with movements
of the bowels and discharge of flatus.A free emission of pale,
colorless urine is sometimes followed by relief.This occurs in
hysterical cases, and the disease is generally accompanied with some
uterine disorder and with tenderness along the spine.The attack of intestinal colic may be developed suddenly and with full
intensity, or it may be preceded a short time, usually a few hours, and
rarely much longer, by prodromic symptoms.These are nausea, a
sensation of weight in the epigastrium, anorexia, eructations,
tympanites, rumbling, and slight griping pains.The patient is
irritable and restless, his bowels are usually confined, and urination
is often rendered painful by the distended bowels pressing upon the
bladder.These symptoms, which are in truth but a part of the attack, being only
of a lower grade, increase in severity and the pain becomes more acute
and distinctly paroxysmal.It is of a sharp cutting, twisting, or most
frequently griping character, and is in the earlier part of the attack
usually referred to the umbilicus or to one of the iliac fossae, and
sometimes radiating thence in different directions.Generally it
becomes concentrated about the umbilicus.The exacerbations of pain
vary in degree of severity, in duration, and in frequency of
recurrence, while the intervals may afford complete relief or merely a
remission of the acute suffering.The sufferer either lies quietly upon
his abdomen or upon one side or the other, with his body bent forward
and thighs flexed, or he is restless and writhes in pain, groaning and
crying out from the intensity of suffering.He may seek relief by
trying a variety of positions and by pressure applied with the hands or
some solid object against the abdomen.Anxiety and pain are depicted in
his features.His face and extremities are cool and covered with a
clammy sweat.The pulse is small, hard, and generally slower than
normal.Breathing is sometimes oppressed, as a result of spasmodic
contraction of the abdominal and thoracic muscles.Often the muscles of
the hands, calves of the legs, and the feet are similarly affected.The
tongue is moist and as a rule clean.The bowels are constipated--at
times so much so as to amount to obstruction--or, again, diarrhoea and
tenesmus may be present.Other abdominal symptoms are nausea or vomiting, eructation of gas, and
borborygmi.Micturition is at times urgent and painful, and the
testicles are frequently retracted.The abdomen is occasionally tender, but pressure generally affords
relief.It is distended with gas, especially over the large bowel.Palpation often reveals lumps or knots situated within the abdominal
walls and due to spasmodic contraction of its muscles, particularly of
the recti.In thin persons the constricted and dilated coils of the
intestines can also be distinguished as nodular masses which rapidly
alter in shape and position.The severity of attacks of colic varies from a few slight griping pains
felt at intervals to a seizure of such intensity that the patient
suffers agony and presents symptoms of an alarming nature.Fortunately,
these grave cases are comparatively seldom observed.In them the local
and general symptoms are aggravated.Pain is more intense and {662}
constant, having less marked intervals of relief, and the patient may
pass into collapse, with a small, rapid, and wavering pulse, restricted
respiration, shivering and chilliness, and a cool, clammy skin.The
abdomen is greatly distended; hiccough comes on, also stercoraceous
vomiting, tenesmus, and in the worst cases involuntary stools and
suppression of urine.Nervous symptoms have been observed, as dizziness
or fainting, and finally delirium and convulsions may end the scene.VARIETIES.--Attention has been called to a distinct form of enteralgia
due to the effects of alcohol.[16] It affects steady drinkers, and is,
as a rule, met with only during the hot months.The presence of
undigested food within the alimentary canal or exposure to cold may act
as exciting causes of the disease.Dull pains, felt at first over the abdomen, become later more
continuous and fixed about the epigastrium or umbilicus.Sometimes they
are complained of more over the bladder.Bilious vomiting and hiccough
are prominent symptoms; the patient is thirsty, and the liquids taken
only promote vomiting; and the bowels are constipated.There is
restlessness, and sleep is obtained with difficulty.Paralysis at times
supervenes, and affects the lower as well as upper extremities.In the
worst cases delirium and even convulsions occur.The disease nearly
always ends in recovery in from three to ten days.Severe intestinal
and gastric pain occurs in opium-eaters, but especially in women who
use morphia in excess.The suffering is always greater when the opiate
is reduced, but can only be cured by breaking up the bad habit.[Footnote 16: Colica bacchanalium, J. H. Claiborne, _Med.Monthly_, New
York, 1855, p.A variety of colic which occurs epidemically[17] in some of the
inter-tropical countries has been studied and described by different
observers.It is known by various names, such as colique seche; colique
vegetale; rachialgie vegetal; colic of Poitou, of Devonshire, of
Madrid, of Java, of Surinam; colique nerveuse; endemique des Pays
Chauds (Fonssagrives); endemic colic, dry colic, bilious colic, nervous
colic; girafy; dandy, etc.Segoud called it a neurosis of the great
sympathetic, and attributed the disease to the effect of cold.[18] The
symptoms resemble, in many respects, those of lead colic, and at one
time they were erroneously considered identical with it.[19] Thompson
and Chisholm,[20] after an {663} experience with the disease in the
West Indies, assert that such is not the case.Epidemics which occurred
in Madrid and several of the Spanish provinces, and many hundred cases
witnessed among the French soldiers by other observers, were
ascertained not to be due to lead-poisoning.[Footnote 17: Colique vegetale, or endemic and epidemic colic, did not
escape the notice of the older writers.It is mentioned by Aretaeus;
Paulus AEgineta describes an epidemic of the disease which extended
through Italy and a large part of the Roman empire, and he states that
attacks were often followed by paralysis.Francois Citois gives an
account of an epidemic which raged at Poitou in 1616.Monson Smith
described the disease in 1717.In 1724 it appeared in Devonshire,
England, and presented the characteristic symptoms and sequelae.In
more recent times epidemics of the disease have occurred in nearly all
the countries of Europe.It prevailed in the northern part of France
and in Belgium from 1853 to 1859, inclusive.It has likewise visited
the Caribbee Isles, Cayenne, Guadaloupe, Madagascar, India, the West
Indies, some of the provinces of Spain, Java, the west coast of Africa,
the Antilles, Senegal, New Zealand, Brazil, and various other
localities.The disease occurs in all seasons, but is more prevalent in
summer and in the commencement of autumn.][Footnote 18: Segoud, _Essai sur la Nevralgie du Grand Sympathique_,
Paris, 1837.][Footnote 19: The disease frequently appeared on board of French
war-vessels, and was regarded by Lefevre (_Recherches sur les Causes de
la Colique seche_) as due to lead-poisoning.He asserts that lead is
more used in French ships than in those of other nations, and accounts
for its being epidemic in tropical countries because a warm climate
aids in developing the affection, and because there men drink more
freely of water.(See also Dutrouleau, _Arch.gen._, 1855, "Mal des
Europeens dans les Pays Chauds.")][Footnote 20: Quoted by Oppolzer, _Wien.The affection is not accompanied with any constant lesion.Pascal[21]
made post-mortem examinations in six cases and found the mucous
membrane of the duodenum a little reddened: the gall-bladder contained
thick bile, and in a few cases there was congestion of the sympathetic
ganglia.The attack is usually marked by certain prodromic symptoms.The patient complains of malaise, loss of appetite, a load in the
epigastrium, embarras gastrique, dull pains in the colon, borborygmi,
and cramps or tingling in the limbs.For the first few days the bowels
generally move several times daily.The stools are difficult, painful,
and of a black or dark-green color, offensive odor, and accompanied
with the discharge of flatus.As the disease progresses the bowels
become constipated and the discharge of gas ceases.After a few days
the pain is more severe and radiates to the lumbar region, the
testicles, or the thighs.It is seated principally in the epigastrium,
in the line of the transverse colon, or it may involve the whole
abdomen.Movement aggravates the pain, while pressure often relieves
it.The tongue is large, trembling, and coated white or yellow; the
breath is fetid, the saliva viscid, and mouth sticky.Anorexia is
complete; there are hiccough, nausea, vomiting of undigested food and
mucous or bilious matters, and constipation with hard black stools.The abdomen may be distended or
retracted, and micturition is often painful and the urine high-.The pulse is generally slower than in health, but becomes accelerated
when the attack is over.The skin is pale, the conjunctiva often
stained with bile, and in the later stages oedema of the lids and
emaciation come on.The effect upon the nervous system may manifest
itself by amaurosis, deafness, delirium, mania, coma, epileptiform
convulsions, or paralysis.The paralysis affects the extensors of the
hand, arm, and leg, or it may become general and end in death.[Footnote 21: "Recherches anatomico-pathologique sur la Colique dite de
Madrid," _Rec.mil._, Paris, 1826, xix.The duration of the disease is from eight to fifteen days, but in some
cases it becomes chronic.At times
intermittent or remittent symptoms develop, and occasionally the
affection is complicated with enteritis or peritonitis.The prognosis
depends very much upon the character of the epidemic, and the most
serious cases are those accompanied with either cerebral symptoms or
peritonitis.The paralysis sometimes passes off in a few days, but oftener lasts
indefinitely.Emetics, purgatives, and anodynes are recommended in the
treatment of the disease, and frequently a change of climate is
necessary in order to recover fully from the affection.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of enteralgia usually presents some
difficulty even when the symptoms are well marked.That the disease is
a true neuralgia is apparent from the periodical recurrence of the
pain, its sharp and darting character, from the sudden cessation
followed by complete relief, and from the absence of symptoms of
indigestion.Affections bearing a certain resemblance to enteralgia are
to be excluded.In lumbo-abdominal neuralgia the pain is unilateral and extends around
{664} to the back.Tender spots can usually be detected by pressure on
the umbilical or hypogastric regions or on the spinous processes of the
vertebrae.In dermalgia the soreness is superficial, and light pressure
gives more pain than deep compression, while nervous and hysterical
symptoms are constantly associated with this form.Gastralgia is more
frequent than enteralgia, and the pain is located about the ensiform
cartilage.In myalgia of the abdominal parietes pressure causes pain,
as do also movements of the body, coughing, sneezing, etc.Rheumatic
pains would likely be felt in other muscles.In ileus the pain is more
continuous, the tenderness localized; there is constipation of a most
obstinate character, and vomiting of stercoraceous matter.The patient
has an anxious expression and a rapid, feeble pulse.In renal calculus
the pain is situated in the course of the ureter and shoots down to the
pubes and thighs.There is frequent desire to urinate, accompanied by a
scanty discharge of urine, and a copious flow of urine is followed by
cessation of pain.The maximum of pain in hepatic colic is situated in
the right hypochondrium, and is often reflected into the shoulder of
the same side.Colic arising from
lead-poisoning is usually associated with sufficiently characteristic
symptoms to render the diagnosis easy.When syphilitic the pain is apt
to be most severe at night.In catarrh of the bowel the skin is hot and dry, the pulse accelerated,
and other indications of a symptomatic fever are presented.The pain is
more constant, more localized, and pressure causes it to be increased.Tenderness on pressure is not invariably met with, but the rule holds
good that when deep pressure increases the pain inflammation rather
than enteralgia is indicated.If colic is due to indigestible food, a sensation of weight will be
complained of at the epigastrium, griping pains occur at short
intervals, with flatulence, vomiting, and later diarrhoea.If the
attack be wind colic, the abdomen is enlarged by tympanitic distension;
borborygmi and belching occur.If it is the result of accumulation of
feces, there would be a previous history of constipation, and the lump
of feculent matter can be located by palpation and percussion.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of idiopathic enteralgia is favorable, the
disease generally terminating after a variable period.Attacks are very
apt to recur, and each one will, in all probability, prove more severe
than the preceding.In symptomatic enteralgia the prognosis will depend
upon the nature of the fundamental disease.Colic terminates favorably in nearly every case.Death has rarely
occurred from complications, as convulsions, and rupture of the bowel
has been observed from great distension.TREATMENT.--If attacks of enteralgia are associated with hysterical
symptoms, it would be proper to employ antispasmodic sedatives.The
compound spirit of ether is very useful in these cases, especially if
they are accompanied with flatulence.Rubbing the spine with
stimulating or anodyne liniments frequently promises well.The
hypodermic dose of morphia gives relief more quickly than can be got in
any other way, but in pure enteralgia with frequently recurring
paroxysms care must be taken not to create the demand for the remedy by
giving it often.The radical cure of the disease is a more important
matter than the treatment of the acute attacks.{665} If the cause of enteralgia be located in some of the solid
viscera or in the nervous system, remedies should be addressed to these
parts, and the reflex nervous impressions allayed by the bromides or
other nervous sedatives.The valerianate of zinc in doses of one grain
three or four times a day is extremely useful in neuralgia from reflex
irritation of the female pelvic organs.Constitutional remedies are
indicated in the cases due to a morbid condition of the blood--iodide
of potassium and mercury if a syphilitic poison or if of a rheumatic or
plumbic origin; colchicum if gouty; quinia if malarial; and iron when
an anaemic state is presented.H. C. Wood states that alum is used with
success; being of service when there is no lead in the primae viae, it
must act in some other way than as a chemical antidote.Arsenic is very
highly recommended in idiopathic enteralgia.Excellent results have
been reported from the use of nitrate of silver,[22] hydrocyanic acid,
belladonna,[23] and iodoform.Change of climate and travel may have to
be resorted to in obstinate cases.[Footnote 22: Nauman, _Deutsche Klinik_, Bd.[Footnote 23: _Lancet_, vol.The objects of treatment in colic are to relieve suffering and
terminate the attack as soon as possible.For this purpose the various
anodyne and antispasmodic remedies, as opium, hyoscyamus, chloral,
ether, chloroform, Indian hemp, and camphor, may be employed.Carminatives are most useful, alone or combined with anodynes and
cathartics.Oleum cajuputi often affords immediate relief.Warm teas of
chamomile, ginger, valerian, or peppermint sometimes do good.When the
suffering is very acute nothing acts so promptly as a hypodermic
injection of morphia, either alone or combined with atropia.The surface of the body should be kept warm, and hot applications to
the abdomen assist in relieving pain.The heat may be conveniently
applied by means of poultices, hot salt- or sand-bags, or rubber
bottles filled with hot water.Cold,[24] used externally, is more
grateful in some cases, and is preferable if there be much tympanites.Sinapisms, turpentine stupes, and stimulating and rubefacient liniments
answer well in some cases, and should be tried.Anodyne applications to
the spine occasionally do good, and cold, applied by means of the
spinal ice-bag, is recommended by Ringer.[Footnote 24: Roux, _Journal de Medecine_, Paris, 1765, p.In order to treat the disease successfully and bring the attack to an
end, its cause should be ascertained if possible, and remedies directed
to its removal.If it be the result of indigestion, the contents of the
stomach should be removed by emetics.Drastic or powerful cathartics
will only tend to aggravate the disease, and on that account mild
laxatives are to be preferred in all cases.Castor oil, calomel, pil.In flatulent colic means should be directed to expel the gas.Anodynes--preferably chloroform--and carminatives should be
administered by the mouth, and enemata containing turpentine or
asafoetida injected into the rectum.In severe cases a clyster with ten
or fifteen drops of liquor ammoniae is said to do good.If distension
of the bowel be so great as to threaten rupture, it may with propriety
and safety be relieved by puncturing the colon with an exploring-needle
or a fine trocar.In cases of flatulent colic where the gas arises from
the decomposition of food {666} remedies to check fermentation, such as
alkalies, creasote, carbolic acid, or the sulphites, would be
indicated.Good sometimes results from pressure and massage of the
abdomen.Rubbing with etherized oils and electricity have also been
used successfully.If the attack be from fecal impaction, it may be
possible to liquefy and remove the mass by using saline cathartics, as
sulphate of magnesium, aided by large oily or mucilaginous clysters,
which in obstinate cases should be injected through a flexible rubber
tube passed up the rectum as far as possible.Injections of an infusion
of tobacco are now seldom used for this purpose, on account of the
dangerous symptoms which often supervene.If pain or tenderness be
present at the seat of impaction, cathartics should be used very
cautiously or not at all, and opium given instead.The administration
of this drug, by relieving pain and allaying spasmodic action, is often
followed by free catharsis.Persons subject to attacks of colic may diminish the intensity, or even
prevent the recurrence, of the disease by employing during the
intervals such remedies as would be indicated in their individual
cases.Phosphate of sodium has been highly recommended for preventing
the recurrence of attacks of colic.R. N. Taylor states[25] that his
experience with the use of the drug is quite extensive, and he found
the treatment uniformly successful.Thirty grains dissolved in a
glassful of water may be taken three times a day--preferably before
meals--and this quantity should be reduced if it causes any irritation
of the stomach.The bowels should be regulated and strict attention
given to diet.A milk diet is of course best in obstinate cases.Any
article of food known to disagree must be excluded, and tea, coffee,
and alcoholic drinks should also be prohibited.Herald_, Louisville, 1880-81, ii.{667}

ACUTE INTESTINAL CATARRH (DUODENITIS, JEJUNITIS, ILEITIS, COLITIS,
PROCTITIS).BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Enteritis, Catarrhal enteritis, Mucous enteritis,
Endo-enteritis, Ileo-colitis, Entero-colitis, Diarrhoea.Older
synonyms: Chordapsus, Cauma enteritis, Enterophlogia, Enterophlogosis,
Colica acuta seu inflammatoria, Ileus inflammatorius, Enteralgia
inflammatoria, Febris intestinorum seu Iliaca inflammatoria, Colique
inflammatoire.HISTORY.--It is interesting to start at the fountain-head of the two
streams of inquiry--the clinical and the anatomical--and to follow each
in its widely-diverging wanderings until they unite to give to the
phenomena of intestinal inflammation a just interpretation.The symptom diarrhoea was fully described by the earliest writers in
medicine.[1] The symptomatic differences between diarrhoea, dysentery,
and lientery and the different forms of diarrhoea (bilious, watery,
etc.)were given in detail by the Greek and Roman physicians.The
Arabians had a much more elaborate classification of the fluxes.Avicenna made seven varieties of simple diarrhoea.European writers
followed closely in these footsteps.Sennert made twelve and Sauvages
twenty-one varieties of diarrhoea, depending upon as many different
causes, as undigested food, worms, the bile, etc.Many recent writers
have adhered closely to the older authors in their method of treating
of diarrhoea, regarding it as a disease and dividing it into varieties
based on the causes or on the appearances of the stools.Among them may
be mentioned Cullen (1789), Good (1825), Tweedie (1841), G. B. Wood
(1852), Trousseau (1865), and Habershon (1879).[Footnote 1: J. J. Woodward, _Med.of the War_, Part 2,
Medical Volume, foot-note, p.273 _et seq._]

It was only after many years of laborious investigation that the
appropriate lesion was affixed to a symptom so well understood and
described in its clinical aspects.The first conception of abdominal
and intestinal inflammation had no relation to diarrhoea.Under the
name [Greek: eileos], Hippocrates described abdominal symptoms of
intestinal obstruction and inflammation.For Sennert (1641)
inflammation of the intestines meant peritonitis.Bonet (1679), Hoffman
(1710), and Boerhaave (1758) included under this head peritonitis,
ileus, and all febrile and painful abdominal affections.Sauvages
(1763) and Morgagni (1779) gave in detail the symptoms of peritonitis
and called the disease intestinal inflammation--enteritis.In 1784,
Cullen made an advance in subdividing {668} enteritis into e.
phlegmonodoea and e. erythematica--the one involving the entire wall of
the intestine and the peritoneum, the other the mucous membrane lining
the intestine.John Hunter (1794) first fixed the place of peritonitis
as a distinct affection from inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
intestines.[2]

[Footnote 2: J. Hunter, _A Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation, and
Gun-shot Wounds_, London, 1794, p.Up to this time constipation was the chief symptom of enteritis.The
meeting of the streams, the affixing the symptom diarrhoea to its
appropriate lesion, was brought about hypothetically at first by J.
Carmichael Smith in these words: "I think it is probable (for we can
have no positive evidence of the fact) that in diarrhoeas from catching
cold the villous or interior coat of the stomach is sometimes slightly
inflamed."[3]

[Footnote 3: Paper read Jan.On the Continent enteritis soon after this was limited in its meaning
by Pinel (1798) to inflammation of the mucous membrane of any part of
the intestines.He gave the name catarrhal diarrhoea to the same
condition.A still further restriction of its meaning was made by
Broussais (1821), who defined enteritis to be an inflammation of the
mucous membrane of the small intestine; he gave the name colitis to the
same disease in the colon.This distinction was adopted by Rostan
(1826), Andral (1836), C. H. Fuchs (1846), G. B. Wood (1852),
Wunderlich (1856), Grisolle (1865), Flint (1866), and Aitkin (1868).According to the views of some authors, chiefly English, as Copland
(1844), Bristowe (1871), Roberts (1874), Habershon (1879), enteritis
includes inflammation of the serous as well as of the mucous coat of
the intestines.Niemeyer (1864), Jaccoud (1869), Leube (1875), Bartholow (1880), and
most German and French authors prefer the name intestinal catarrh as
applied to inflammation of the mucous coat; inflammation of the serous
coat is peritonitis; the word enteritis is abandoned as involving a
pathological error.NATURE AND CLASSIFICATION.--Catarrh of the intestines is an
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the intestinal tract.There are
various peculiarities of the catarrhal process due to the anatomical
structure of the parts involved, the presence of open glands, lymphatic
follicles, etc.This disease is to be distinguished from inflammation
of the serous coat of the intestine (peritonitis).The two are quite
distinct in their etiology, pathological anatomy, and symptomatology,
although they have been often confounded under the same name,
enteritis.[4] As so much confusion prevails as to the proper meaning of
enteritis, it is best to abandon the word altogether.[Footnote 4: For cases called enteritis in which the lesions of
peritonitis were found, see Hamilton, _Edin.Examiner_, Oct., 1869, p.Diarrhoea is still regarded by some authors (J. J. Woodward) as
synonymous with intestinal catarrh; by others it is considered
separately as a disease distinct from catarrh.Habershon describes the
lesions of catarrhal diarrhoea and mucous enteritis almost in the same
words.[5] It is an unscientific method to take one symptom of a
pathological state, to {669} erect it into a disease, subdividing it
into varieties which are but differences in the intensity of its
manifestation, and to assign to it no fixed lesion.Diarrhoea is in
reality but a sequence and symptom of hyperaemia or inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane.[Footnote 5: Such a method of treating the subject involves a
repetition, with an inversion, of the same description.Thus, catarrhal
diarrhoea has as its lesion mucous enteritis; mucous enteritis has for
its symptom (catarrhal) diarrhoea.]ETIOLOGY.--Intestinal inflammation is more prevalent in the Northern,
Middle, and Western than in the Southern States.There is no relation
between the distribution of malarial and intestinal diseases: in some
regions where malarial disease is rife there is very little disease of
the intestines.Limited areas in Lower Mississippi, Eastern Kentucky,
Eastern North Carolina, etc.have a special predisposition to diseases
of this class.[6]

[Footnote 6: F. A. Walker, _Statistical Atlas_, 1874, table v. p.During the Civil War diarrhoea and dysentery were more frequent and
fatal in the central region than in the Atlantic and Pacific regions.It is difficult to compare the relative liabilibity of the native and
foreign-born populations in the United States to intestinal disease.Inasmuch as children, among whom the bulk of such cases occur, bear
such a small proportion to the adult foreign population, allowing for
differences due to this cause, statistics show that the foreign-born
race has a very distinct predisposition to these forms of disease.[7]
The Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes have a marked susceptibility to
intestinal diseases; the English and Welsh have the same tendency; but
the Irish have a comparative immunity.The <DW52> race is more prone
to intestinal than to malarial diseases in the Middle States, but there
is the reverse susceptibility in the Northern and Southern States.[Footnote 7: The number of children under ten to 1000 native population
is 306; number of children under ten in 1000 foreign population, 47 (F.
A. Walker, "Relations of Race and Nationality to Mortality in the
United States," _Statistical Atlas_, 1874, p.Under ten years more males than females have enteritis, in the
proportion represented by the figures 362 and 299.After ten the
predisposition of the two sexes is about the same.The summer is the season when diarrhoea is most prevalent and most
fatal.June, July, and August are the months in which the greatest
number of cases occur and in which there is the highest mortality.The
extraordinary death-rate in these months in cities is of course due to
the influence of summer heat on children, and the death-rate from
diarrhoea and entero-colitis is chiefly among infants under one year.The highest monthly mortality
from acute diarrhoea among the U.S.troops (white) between 1861 and
1866 was 147, in July, 1862; the next highest was 114, in August, 1862.June and September were after these the most fatal months.According to
the census of 1870, the most fatal month is August.Elevation of temperature in the summer months is the cause of the
prevalence of intestinal catarrh and of its great mortality among
infants and children.The number of deaths bears a direct ratio to the
degree of heat, the highest death-rate occurring in seasons of unusual
high temperature.[8] The effect of excessive or prolonged heat is to
arrest or weaken the digestive processes; undigested masses in the
stomach or the intestines act as foreign bodies and produce
inflammation.[Footnote 8: Among the numerous publications bearing on this subject,
those contained in _The Sanitary Care and Treatment of Children and
their Diseases_ (Boston, 1881) are of especial value.S. C. Busey's
article contains much valuable matter on the relation of summer heat to
illness and mortality among children.]{670} Sudden changes of temperature from cold to heat or from heat to
cold develop diarrhoea.If the air is at the same time saturated with
moisture, the effect of a change in temperature is greatly intensified.In the first hot days of June there is on the Atlantic coast,
especially in cities, a rapid increase in the number of cases of
gastro-intestinal disturbance.A larger number of children are taken
ill in June than in August.The child in time becomes habituated to
heat, and if not attacked early runs less risk of illness in the later
months.A sudden or unusual exposure to low temperature, as in lying on
damp ground, leads to the same result.The check to perspiration after
violent exercise is especially provocative of diarrhoea.In these
instances the congestion and consequent inflammation of the mucous
membrane are brought about through the effect of heat or cold upon the
peripheral nervous system.Cold may act more directly by the driving of
suddenly-cooled blood from the surface of the body to the interior.External burns belong to the same category, as they lead to extensive
inflammation, sometimes to ulceration, of the duodenal mucous membrane
through reflex influence.A case is reported of a boy aged twelve years
who after an external superficial burn of the left thigh was taken with
profuse diarrhoea which ended fatally in three hours (Ziemssen).Contamination of the atmosphere with emanations the result of the
overcrowding of many human beings together, as in prisons, camps, or
asylums, especially where decomposition of organic matter is going on,
is of great influence in causing diarrhoea.Persons living in
badly-ventilated houses, or in houses improperly drained where the air
is vitiated by escaping gas from sewer-pipes, are especially prone to
be attacked.But sewer-gas, per se, does not cause diarrhoea any more
than it causes diphtheria or scarlatina.[9] It is a step backward to
hang upon this ready explanation all our doubts and our ignorance of
the origin of disease.The specific germ of the zymotic diseases may be
conveyed in the gases from sewers, but there are other and more direct
modes of communication which should receive equal attention.Journ._, London, 1880, vol.519) believes that summer diarrhoea has a specific poison which is
intimately connected with the process of putrefaction, and that the
infective material has its source in the public sewers.]Children are much more liable to intestinal inflammation than adults.This is due to the greater susceptibility of the mucous membrane in
them to congestion and catarrh from external influences and from direct
irritation.In infants fed upon an unsuitable diet--cow's milk or other
substitutes for mother's milk--this susceptibility is much increased.The age most liable to attack is under one year, or from the first to
the second year, when, in consequence of dentition, weaning, and a
change from a diet chiefly or almost wholly liquid to one of solids,
there is a great liability to a disturbance of the normal equilibrium.Intestinal catarrh forms almost one-third of the total number of the
affections of childhood.According to the census of 1870, 761 out of
every 1000 deaths from diarrhoea, dysentery, and enteritis occurred
under the tenth year.In old age a similar predisposition exists, and a
mild attack will in old persons induce more serious symptoms than in
middle life.Epidemics of diarrhoea among the aged in asylums and
hospitals are not uncommon.{671} Temperament and idiosyncrasy are causes of differences in
predisposition.Many persons in consequence of taking cold invariably
have diarrhoea, while others as invariably have nasal catarrh or
bronchitis.Certain articles of food, as oysters and eggs, lead always
in some persons to intestinal disturbance.An exaggerated sensibility
of the mucous membrane to particular impressions is the cause of this
peculiarity.Previous attacks of intestinal inflammation render the individual
liable to recurrences from very slight causes.The suppression of the
menses and of hemorrhoidal discharges and the healing of eruptions are
said to be followed by serious diarrhoea, but such an occurrence is
probably more often a coincidence than a result.Sedentary life, by enfeebling muscular movement and by inducing
indigestion and constipation, brings on diarrhoea.Constipation impairs
the muscular tone of the bowel, and hardened fecal accumulations act as
irritants which sometimes provoke acute catarrhal processes--diarrhoea
and dysentery.Insufficient clothing in children and in adults makes
the skin more susceptible to changes of temperature and conduces to
intestinal congestion.Smoking in excess and the use of narcotics and
stimulants are mentioned as debilitating causes which pave the way for
disease in the intestine; the habitual use of the stronger liquors, by
keeping up chronic engorgement of the mucous membrane, is undoubtedly a
potent cause.Occupations which involve deprivation of fresh air and
sunlight, and all trades which enfeeble the individual, make him liable
to all digestive disorders.A feeble constitution, debility from
disease, from over-fatigue, or from loss of sleep, or any perturbing
influence, puts the body in a state favorable to indigestion and
diarrhoea.The eruptive fevers are accompanied more or less by gastro-enteric
catarrh.In scarlet fever, measles, and variola there is a state of
equilibrium between the skin and the intestinal mucous membrane.When
the morbid manifestation does not normally appear upon the skin there
is a transference of irritation to the intestine.The administration of
purgatives in the early periods of scarlet fever and measles delays,
sometimes prevents, the outburst of the eruption on the skin.The
intestinal catarrh of the eruptive fevers has sometimes the
significance of an exanthem and sometimes of a secondary complication.In measles it is more frequently the former; in scarlatina and variola
it comes later as a complication.Uraemia, malarial infection, chronic suppuration, pyaemia and
septicaemia, cancerous and strumous disease of the mesenteric glands,
scurvy, tuberculosis, Bright's disease, and chronic wasting diseases in
general, are conditions in which diarrhoea appears as a result of the
defective nutrition of the vessels of the intestinal wall and their
liability to dilatation and hyperaemia, or from the presence in the
blood of septic matter.[10]

[Footnote 10: For experiments relating to the production of intestinal
catarrh by injections of irritating or putrid matter into the blood
consult _Traite clinique et experimentelle des Fievres dites
essentielles_, Gaspard et Bouillaud; also, _Path.anat._, Lebert, tome
ii., Texte, Paris, 1861, p.The ingestion of a larger quantity of food than the stomach and
intestines are able to soften, and the taking of food essentially
indigestible or improperly prepared by cooking, are causes of the
passage of masses of food more or less unaltered along the intestinal
tract.Hyperaemia {672} follows the mechanical irritation of the mucous
surface.When articles of food are in a partial state of putrefaction,
so that the antiseptic properties of the gastric juice cannot be
quickly enough brought into play, there is a rapid fermentation in the
stomach, with the development of symptoms of gastric and subsequently
of intestinal catarrh.Unripe fruit, vegetables composed of hard
tissue, as early potatoes, cucumbers, pineapples, and cherries, by
their indigestible nature, are frequent causes.Oysters, crabs, fish,
and lobsters often occasion acute diarrhoea in consequence of being in
an unfit condition for food.Cheese has been known to produce violent
illness with symptoms of intense intestinal irritation; these effects
are due to some poisonous substance, hitherto undiscovered, developed
in the course of putrefaction.New coffee causes diarrhoea; six months
is usually the time before coffee grown in Ceylon reaches the European
and American markets; by this time it does not have this effect.[11]

[Footnote 11: J. Stevenson, "Medical Notes from Ceylon," _Edin.Journ._, Feb., 1862, p.The irritant and caustic poisons, as mineral acids, caustic alkalies,
corrosive sublimate, arsenic, oxalic acid, tartar emetic, and carbolic
acid, kindle an intense inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
stomach, duodenum, and of the lower portion of the intestinal canal.Softening of the coats of the intestines from corrosion, with
perforation, is not an infrequent result.Drastic purgatives act as irritant poisons in producing acute
hyperaemia of the mucous coat with excessive transudation of serum; or,
in other words, an acute catarrh.A discharge of vitiated bile or an
excess of bile is given by recent[12] as well as by older writers as a
provoking cause of diarrhoea.The proper relationship is the reverse of
this: an intestinal catarrh the result of irritant action upon the
mucous surface entails a more active outflow of bile, just as some
cathartics by irritating the duodenum excite the gall-bladder to empty
itself.[13] Impacted fecal masses are direct irritants, exciting
inflammation (typhlitis, dysentery); putrefactive changes in
long-retained fecal collections have an additional power of irritation.Foreign bodies accidentally or purposely swallowed, intestinal
parasites, the pus from an abscess which bursts into the intestine,
likewise are excitants of disease.Tubercle nodules, typhoid ulcers,
cancer, or other neoplasms in the wall are surrounded by areas of
inflammation.ed., Philada.,
1880, p.[Footnote 13: "The propositions which are the foundation of the whole
theory that bile can cause diarrhoea, and that its absence leads to
costiveness, cannot be looked upon as proved" (J. Wickham Legg, _On the
Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, New York, 1880, p.Alcohol taken in excess, as in a debauch, leads to acute
gastro-intestinal catarrh.The stomach symptoms are the earliest to
develop and are the most prominent.Habitual alcoholic indulgence is a
more common source of chronic than of acute intestinal catarrh.The influence of unwholesome drinking-water as a cause of diarrhoea has
been carefully examined by Woodward.[14] Turbid or muddy water holding
inorganic matters in suspension, he concludes from the evidence, is not
a source of disease, and the injurious effects of such waters have been
grossly exaggerated.Water containing inorganic substances in solution
produce diarrhoea, and are purgative if the dissolved matters have
purgative properties.Limestone-water may produce {673} temporary
disturbance of the bowels, but is wholesome.Carbonate and sulphate of
lime and magnesium in solution are more cathartic, but not as much so
as selenitic waters which contain an excess of sulphate of lime.The
salts of sodium and potassium in the waters of Colorado, New Mexico,
and Utah are still more liable to produce diarrhoea.History of the War_, Part 2, Medical
Volume, p.599 _et seq._]

Water contaminated with organic matters of vegetable origin, which are
found in states of decomposition in marshes and stagnant pools, does
not, in the opinion of Woodward and Parkes, have very great influence
in the production of diarrhoea or dysentery.Impurities from
decomposition of animal matters are unhealthful.This is especially
true of water impregnated with soakage from privies and sewers; and yet
epidemics of diarrhoea cannot as often be clearly traced to this source
as can outbreaks of typhoid fever.Parkes says water contaminated with
three to ten grains per gallon of putrescent animal matter may be
hurtful.Contusions and injuries of the bowel by sudden pressure or shock to the
abdominal wall may lead to intestinal inflammation.The large intestine
is more exposed from its size and position to such injuries.Pressure
upon the bowel by a tumor, as an enlarged or retroverted uterus, may
cause diarrhoea, the source of which may be overlooked.Early-morning
diarrhoea from a displaced womb is of frequent occurrence.Emotional influence, as sudden fright or grief, will produce sudden
diarrhoea.Lesions of nerve-centres--corona radiata, optic thalamus, or
corpus callosum--induce hyperaemia, softening, and ulceration of the
mucous membrane of the small intestine.[15]

[Footnote 15: Rosenthal, "Diseases of the Nervous System," _Wood's
Library_, New York, 1879, vol.Minute organisms (bacteria) are thought by some observers to be the
cause of diarrhoea, especially of a zymotic form, which prevails in the
summer months.In accordance with this theory, the dejecta from
infected persons are the vehicle of the contagious poison which by air-
and water-contamination infects others.[16]

[Footnote 16: Wm.Johnston, _Lancet_, London, 1878, vol.Journ._, London, 1879, p.81; also, G. E. Paget, "On
the Etiology of Zymotic Diarrhoea," _Brit.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--A description of the morbid anatomy of acute
intestinal catarrh includes the changes which are observed (1) in the
exterior appearances of the intestines, (2) in their contents, and (3)
in the condition of their mucous lining.The external appearances of the intestines depend upon the degree of
distension of the tube, the character of the contents, and the presence
or absence of inflammation of the serous coat.Great distension of the
colon, of the caecum, and of the small intestines is met with in acute
intestinal catarrh of some duration, and is due to relaxation of the
muscular coat.The
calibre of the tube may be lessened by strong contraction of the
muscular layer in acute intestinal inflammation of great intensity with
early and fatal termination.The color of the exterior varies with the
tension of the wall, the color of the contents, and the amount of
vascular injection.If the bowel is much distended with gas, the color
is pale; the mingling of bile with the feces causes a yellowish or
brownish color; if blood is in the tube a dull red hue is given to the
walls.If the intestine is congested or inflamed, the vessels are
outlined distinctly and can be seen in {674} different layers.The
areas of external redness generally correspond to internal hyperaemic
patches.The serous membrane shows arborescent congestion at the
mesenteric attachment or is inflamed from perforation; the signs of
peritonitis are most marked in the neighborhood of the
irregularly-shaped, round, oval, or pin-point openings in the gut.The
abdominal cavity may contain fecal matter, food, medicines, or worms
which have passed through the perforation.The intestinal contents, instead of being homogeneous, of
pale-yellow color, and pea-soup-like appearance in the small intestine,
brown and more condensed in the lower part of the large intestine, may
present various changes.The fluid is usually increased in quantity,
and is thinner than normal in the colon: the color is greenish from the
bile, very pale from the closure of the bile-duct, red or black from
blood.The odor is absent from excess of serum, or very offensive from
decomposition due sometimes to the closure of the common bile-duct and
the want of bile.Shreds or masses of mucus may float in the liquid.Undissolved pills or drugs, as bismuth, accumulated seeds, skins of
fruits or vegetables, parasites, or foreign bodies are seen.Epithelial
cells, the debris of digestion, micrococci, and bacteria are visible
under the microscope.Inflammation involving the mucous membrane of the whole intestinal
canal is rarely or never met with.The nearest approach to generalized
catarrh of the bowel is found in eruptive fevers, especially measles.Inflammation extending throughout the whole length of either the small
or large intestine alone, and affecting all parts equally, is also
rare.The ileum is the part of the small intestine most frequently the
seat of disease, but the ileum is rarely affected alone.Inflammation
is more frequently limited to the colon than to the small intestine.The most common form of intestinal inflammation is ileo-colitis, where
the lower part of the ileum and a part of the colon, sometimes of
considerable extent, are inflamed.The duodenum is sometimes the seat
of a local inflammation, but this rarely happens except in the case of
external burns; duodenitis is most frequently an extension of catarrh
from the stomach, but the pathological anatomy of the duodenum presents
some peculiarities which will be described hereafter.(_a_) Hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous membrane may exist without
inflammation.The engorgement of the veins by mechanical retardation in
disease of the liver, heart, or lungs does not constitute catarrh,
although it is sooner or later followed by catarrhal processes, usually
of a chronic nature.Gravitation of blood to the most dependent parts
in cases of long illness distends the vessels, and post-mortem
hypostasis leads to the passage of serum and coloring matter into the
meshes of the mucous and submucous tissue.In fatal cases of acute
diarrhoea sometimes no lesion has been observed.The hyperaemic
membrane pales after death, as does the skin in scarlatina and
erysipelas.[17] The presence or absence of hyperaemia is therefore no
positive proof of the previous existence or non-existence of
inflammation.To constitute inflammation there must be other changes
besides hyperaemia, as oedema, softening, and infiltration with
cell-elements.[Footnote 17: It is difficult to recognize post-mortem hyperaemia in
the mucous membrane of the mouth or throat where intense inflammation
has been seen in life.]{675} A degree of vascular turgescence visible to the naked eye is
nearly always present in the mucous and submucous tissues which have
been the seat of catarrh.It is usually found in the lower part of the
ileum, the caecum, sigmoid flexure, and other parts of the colon.The
redness is diffused over a surface of several feet in length or is
circumscribed in patches of varying size.When vessels of small size
are distended with blood, red branching lines are seen (arborescent or
ramiform injection) which have their starting-point in the insertion of
the mesentery.When the capillary system is engorged a fine interlacing
network can be discovered, which gives to the membrane a more uniform
red color.Parallel lines or bands of redness extend in a transverse
direction across the axis of the canal corresponding to the folds of
mucous membrane in the small and large intestine.The shades of color depend upon the intensity and duration of the
congestion.In acute mild forms the color is light red; in more intense
grades the membrane is more vivid or purplish.Brown and slate-
tints show a passage into the chronic stage.A black hue occurs in
gangrenous inflammation.Minute dots (speckled redness) are due to
minute extravasations, and ecchymotic irregular patches are sometimes
seen.Bile-staining of the mucous surface is met with; this cannot be removed
by washing.In metallic poisoning the redness is more vivid and the
mucous membrane is eroded.[18]

[Footnote 18: For  plates illustrating hyperaemia and
inflammation of the intestines see Carswell, _Path.Anat._, London,
1838, plate ii.These are beautiful representations of
(1) ramiform vascular injection passing into (2) capilliform injection,
which becomes (3) uniformly red, or from its intensity (4) ecchymotic
or hemorrhagic.See also Annesley, _Morbid Anatomy_, London, 1828,
plates x.2), xiii., xxii., xxiv., and xxv.Many of these are
illustrations of peritonitis as a complication of enteritis.See also
Kupferlafelnzer, Lesser, _Ueber die entzundung und Verschwarung der
Schleimhaut des Verdauungskals_, Berlin, 1830, tab.3; also J.
Hope, _Illustrations of Morbid Anatomy_, London, 1834, figs.116, 118,
124, and 125.These plates are wonderful in their truthfulness and
execution.](_b_) Acute oedema and increase in the cell-elements in the inflamed
parts give rise to swelling and to softening, so that the mucous
membrane seems to be easily scraped off.This is not always the case,
as no loss of firmness of the reddened tissue is often found.In the
small intestine the villi, which in health are not seen, become
enlarged, giving a "plush-like" or velvety appearance to the mucous
membrane; they are sometimes club-shaped from epithelial accumulations
on their free extremities.(_c_) When the small intestine is examined the solitary glands, which
in the normal state are barely visible, are so enlarged that they
appear as rounded prominences.They are described as looking like
grains of mustard-seed on a red ground, and are the size of pinheads.When they are distinctly seen it may be concluded that they are
enlarged.In children the glands are enlarged when there has been
slight or no diarrhoea.Peyer's patches are also tumefied, and are more distinct from being
elevated above the surface, but they have not in intestinal catarrh as
great a relative enlargement when compared with the solitary glands as
in typhoid fever.The interfollicular substance of the patch may
hypertrophy without any increase in the size of the follicles; a
reticulated {676} appearance is then given to the gland.The color of
the swollen follicles in recent inflammation is translucent from
oedema; later they are gray and opaque.These changes are more marked
at the lower end of the ileum, because the isolated follicles and
Peyer's patches are more numerous there.(_d_) Catarrhal ulcers--erosions--are produced by the loss of
epithelium or from a process of vesicle-forming and rupture, as in
stomatitis.They may enlarge, undermine, and coalesce, thus reaching
quite a large size.They may deepen and perforate the wall of the
bowel, causing peritonitis, or they may heal, forming cicatrices which
in contracting may narrow the canal.Small follicular ulcers are found on the mucous surface.They result
from the breaking down of the exposed wall of the closed follicle from
over-distension.The ulcer is either on the apex of the dome of an
isolated follicle or is within the area of a Peyer's patch.Sometimes
several ulcers may be seen on the surface of the swollen patch.[19] The
ulcerative process is sometimes very rapid.In the case of a child aged
eight years, with no previous intestinal disease, who died in the
Children's Hospital, Washington, in June, 1882, after a two days'
illness with watery discharges and rapid prostration, the solitary
glands throughout the ileum were many of them enlarged.As many as a
dozen small ulcers were seen at the apices of the enlarged follicles.[Footnote 19: See photograph facing page 302 of _Med.In the large intestine the same lesions are found, but in a more
advanced stage, especially in the caecum and descending colon.Enlarged
solitary glands of the size of a pinhead or small bird-shot are
scattered along the canal.Follicular ulcers[20] are found in the large intestine, occupying the
summit of the enlarged follicles and involving a large extent of mucous
surface.Pigment-deposits are seen which give rise to the appearances
described as occurring in chronic intestinal catarrh.[Footnote 20: For description of the mode of formation and growth of
follicular ulcers see article on CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.](_e_) The mucous surface is covered, especially in the areas of
redness, with an adhesive, opaque mucus of neutral or alkaline reaction
and of yellow, red, or brown hue, depending upon the relative amount of
bile or blood.It is composed of mucus-corpuscles, epithelium-cells of
cylindrical and prismatic form, pus-cells, and sometimes
blood-corpuscles.Vibrios and bacteria also are seen.The chief distinction between the lesions of acute intestinal catarrh
and typhoid fever are these: In typhoid fever the number of Peyer's
patches involved is larger; there will be a chain of enlarged glands
from the ileo-caecal valve throughout the ileum, those nearest the
ileum being the most altered.Near the valve there is usually some
ulceration, so that the gland acquires a ragged appearance.In catarrh
of the bowel there is a more irregular distribution of enlarged glands;
they project less above the surface, and if ulcerated have one or two
spots of erosion.In typhoid fever the Peyer's patch has the most
prominence.In catarrh of the bowel the solitary glands are the most
enlarged.In catarrh the large intestine may be the seat of the most
advanced lesion; in typhoid fever, except with rare exceptions, the
lesions in the ileum are most advanced.{677} (_f_) The mesenteric glands are enlarged, but not so uniformly so
or to the same extent as in typhoid fever.The stomach is sometimes
found inflamed, the mucous membrane being reddened, thickened, or
softened.The liver, spleen, and kidneys are normal or present
accidental conditions of disease.In the respiratory organs pulmonary
congestion, pleurisy, and pneumonia are found.The heart contains clots
which are fibrinous or soft and red; they are found on both sides, but
when one cavity alone is filled the right is the common seat.The brain
is usually normal; fluid may be in the subarachnoid space, and thrombi
in the cerebral sinuses.PATHOLOGICAL HISTOLOGY.--In the genesis of catarrh of the intestinal
mucous membrane the first effect of the exciting cause is an
over-distension of the capillaries and small vessels; this congestion
is most marked in the meshwork of vessels around the closed follicles.A transudation of serum takes place into the mucous layer, and in more
marked congestion into the submucous layer also; these tissues become
more or less oedematous and swollen.Transudation of serum into the
intestinal tube follows.From over-stretching the walls of minute
vessels may rupture and small extravasations take place, staining the
tissue red.Post-mortem
extravasations are due to decomposition of the wall of the vessel.Rupture of vessels on the surface leads to escape of blood into the
bowel, which is mixed with the transuded serum.The proper secretion,
intestinal juice, is diminished as a result of these changes, but an
excess of the mucus with which the mucous membrane is always coated
immediately follows.The origin of the mucus is not to be sought for in
the activity of the glands alone, but in the transformation of the
protoplasm of the epithelial cells.[21] The varying proportions of
serum, mucus, and blood cause the stools to be serous, mucous, slimy,
or bloody, hence the terms serous, mucous, and bloody diarrhoea.[Footnote 21: Rindfleisch, _Path.Histology_, Sydenham ed., vol.Hypernutrition, swift life of the mucous membrane, the result of
continued excess of blood, entails the increase of the cell-elements.Lymphoid cells accumulate in the submucous layer, especially where
these cells are normally most numerous.There is a saturation of the
membrane with an excess of plasma.Cells also appear in increasing
numbers in the interfibrillary spaces of the mucous membrane, which
increase its bulk, and the follicles of Lieberkuhn appear as if pushed
apart.Lymph-corpuscles accumulate in the meshes of the closed
follicles, which are distended and project above the surface as
described.Multiplication of the cells within the follicle (follicular
suppuration) causes over-stretching and the wall bursts, forming the
first stage of the follicular ulcer.The appearance upon the epithelial
surface of an increased number of loosened cells, which are sometimes
epithelial in character and at other times resembling pus-cells
(epithelial and purulent catarrh), is believed to be due to a rapid
manufacture and exfoliation of epithelial elements, and to constitute
one of the essential features of catarrh.Desquamation of the
epithelium in catarrh of the bowel, even in that of Asiatic cholera,
has been called in question by Woodward, who thinks that the stripping
off of epithelium is cadaveric.SYMPTOMS.--Owing to the difference in the intensity and extent of {678}
the catarrhal process there is every possible variation in the symptoms
of intestinal inflammation.No one symptomatic picture will properly
represent all cases, and with a view to greater convenience and
exactitude of illustration a division may be made into mild and severer
forms.Under the head of mild forms can be included all cases of intestinal
catarrh which by their short duration and benignant character point to
a mild degree of inflammation.They correspond to the following
anatomical states: hyperaemia of the mucous membrane of parts of the
small or large intestine, or of parts of both simultaneously; slight or
moderate swelling of the membrane from serous saturation; transudation
of serum into the canal; increase of lymphoid cells in the mucous and
submucous tissues; and increased manufacture of epithelial cells, but
without any marked tumefaction or ulceration of the closed follicles.The termination is by resolution, which is reached in a few days
usually, and the membrane is rapidly and entirely restored to the
normal state.Between the normal condition of the mucous membrane, with
its recurring periods of physiological hyperaemia, and the hyperaemia
with exaggerated secretion and peristalsis which leads to diarrhoea,
there is no well-defined border-line.Diarrhoea may be regarded as the
most certain sign of the catarrhal process.Whenever the frequency and
fluidity of the stools are such as to be regarded as pathological, some
stage or other of catarrhal inflammation may be assumed to exist.In a large number of mild forms the onset is sudden.After a meal of
indigestible food or an unusual excess pain will be felt in the
abdomen, recurring in paroxysms, which start in the neighborhood of the
umbilicus and radiate throughout the abdomen.The pain is accompanied
by borborygmi, and is succeeded sooner or later by a desire to go to
stool.The first one or two movements, which follow each other in quick
succession, are more or less consistent or moulded, but in a short time
diarrhoea is established by frequent discharges of watery fluid,
containing perhaps some undigested fragments of food, which may have
been the exciting cause of the illness by mechanical irritation.Each
stool is preceded by colics, griping pains in the abdomen, which are
relieved by the evacuation.An attack beginning in this way and from
such causes may cease in a few hours, and be unattended by any general
symptoms if proper precautions are taken.A slight dryness and coating
of the tongue, with loss of appetite and occasional griping pains or a
tendency to looseness of the stools, may continue for a day or two.Indiscretions in diet or other imprudences, as fatigue, may prolong the
mildest attack during one or more weeks, but the character of the
illness is here due not to the nature of the disease, but to the
addition of fresh causes which delay the natural progress toward
recovery.Severer forms either begin suddenly, as in the milder forms just
described, or are preceded for a time by symptoms of gastric or
intestinal indigestion.The patient may have complained of distress
after eating, flatulence, colicky pains, distension of the abdomen and
tenderness on pressure, loss of appetite, with a general feeling of
ill-health--symptoms which point to the existence of a condition of the
mucous membrane of the gastro-intestinal canal favorable to the action
of an exciting cause.A feeling of chilliness ushers in the attack.This is accompanied by
fever, which at first, and sometimes throughout, is of a marked
remittent type.{679} The griping pains, colics, which at first are
infrequent and dull, now recur at short intervals and become sharper.They are sometimes attended with vomiting of food or of a greenish
fluid.The intensity of suffering may be so great as to cause pallor of
the countenance, a feeling of faintness, and coldness of the surface
with sweating.The paroxysm usually precedes a movement.The more
severe pains extend to the lower extremities and the scrotum.Movement of gas in the intestines produces rumbling, gurgling, or
splashing sounds, called borborygmi.They are paroxysmal, lasting a few
moments, or are coincident with pain, and frequently are the immediate
precursors of an evacuation.The cause for their production is the
quick propulsion of the fluids by strong peristaltic action from one
part of the bowel to the other or the rapid movement of gas within the
bowel.Relief is obtained both from the pain and from the sense of
distension by expulsion of flatus.Tympanites is closely connected with the symptoms just described.An
excess of gases within the bowel is not primarily a result of the
inflammation of the mucous membrane, but is an early phenomenon due to
the decomposition of indigestible food in its transit through the
intestine.Later, the gases are developed very readily by the
decomposition of even the most digestible articles of food, the mucus,
which is the product of the catarrh, acting as a ferment.The distension of the intestinal canal produces an intumescence of the
abdomen which is commonly uniform, but may be greater in some portions
of the tract than in others.Thus the transverse and descending colon
are more projecting and more distinctly outlined than other portions of
the canal.Sensibility of the abdomen to pressure exists along the line of the
colon or over a considerable area.But no defined limitation of the
affected part can usually be made by the location of pain to the touch.If there is any local tenderness, it is over the descending colon.In
one form of enteritis--typhlitis--the localization of the inflammation
in the caecum produces subjective pain and pain on pressure in a
restricted region--a peculiarity which results no doubt from the early
intensity of the inflammation and the implication of the connective
tissue behind the bowel.But this is not true of inflammation of any
other part of the intestinal canal.A sensation of soreness on movement, as in turning in bed, standing, or
walking, is not uncommon, even when the attack is of no great gravity.The patient on standing bends forward to relieve tension, and he may
feel nervous when the bed is shaken.Diarrhoea is the most important symptom, as it is directly related to
catarrh.The number of evacuations varies from one or two to twenty or
more in the day.In cases of medium intensity there are from six to ten
in twenty-four hours, the interval between the movements being two to
three hours during the day and somewhat longer at night.The matters
passed in quantity range from two ounces to a pint; the average is
about four fluidounces.This, however, is subject to great variations,
depending upon the intensity of the disease; the more choleriform the
attack the greater the amount of fluid passed.The weight of the
evacuations varies from five ounces to forty pounds in twenty-four
hours; this increase does not depend upon the greater quantity of water
only, but the solid constituents are in greater amount.{680} The normal brown color, which is due to hydrobilirubin, changes
as the movements become thinner to yellowish-brown or pale yellow from
dilution of the fecal matter with water.An excess of serum or mucus
renders them colorless.A greenish-brown, greenish-yellow, or green hue
is due to the presence of bile.The rapid descent of the contents of
the bowel delays or prevents the reabsorption of bile,[22] or the fluid
is expelled before the usual transformations in color take place.[23]
The bile-pigment is also absent in duodenal catarrh from closure of the
opening of the ductus choledochus.[Footnote 22: L. Brunton, "On the Action of Purgative Medicines," _The
Practitioner_, London, June, 1874, p.[Footnote 23: The reaction of bile-pigment with nitric acid, which does
not take place in the contents of the colon or in normal feces, is seen
in the green stools of acute intestinal catarrh, especially in
children.]The coloration of the stools further depends upon the character of the
food and drink and upon the drugs given.From an exclusive milk diet
the discharges are pale or contain undigested whitish lumps of casein.The preparations of bismuth and iron give a black color and the
sulphate of copper a dark-green hue.A green or greenish-brown tint is
observed after the use of calomel, and while the experiments of the
Edinburgh committee demonstrated that no increase of bile follows its
administration in dogs, yet the opinion is still general that the green
stools contain an excess of bile.Blood appears in three forms in the stools: as a coffee-ground or black
powder from hemorrhage in the stomach or upper bowel; as a reddish
fluid with small coagula in flakes, which come from intense congestion
or ulceration of the intestine; or an abundant hemorrhage may result
from deep ulceration in the duodenum or elsewhere.The characteristic odor of the feces is altered in several ways.As the
movements become less solid they acquire a nauseous or sour smell, due
essentially to the volatile products formed in connection with the
decomposition of fatty matters.[24] When very thin and containing
little or no feculent matter the discharges lose odor, as in cholera,
or they become excessively offensive--cadaveric--in intense and fatal
inflammation and in ulceration of the bowels.After exposure to the air
the stools of diarrhoea undergo decomposition and develop offensive
smells more rapidly than in health.The absence of bile, whether there
is diarrhoea or not, gives rise to a peculiar and unpleasant odor,
showing that this secretion is to some extent an antiseptic.The escape
of fetid gas from the anus is rarely an accompaniment of a decomposed
state of the rectal contents.In children the stools are more variable
in quantity, color, and odor than in adults, and are more readily
affected by the ingesta.[Footnote 24: Guttmann, _Physical Diagnosis_, Sydenham Soc.The odor of normal feces is due to a substance isolated by
Briequer, called scatol, which is a final product of the putrefaction
of albumen (Ewald, _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.In the diarrhoea of old persons the discharges are thin, yellow,
offensive, and often frothy.The disorder of the digestive apparatus is attended with other
symptoms.The tongue is normal in some cases; in others red at the
point and edges with a central whitish coat, or the surface is red,
polished, and dry.Marked change in the appearance of the tongue is due
to a complicating gastric catarrh.There is thirst, with loss of
appetite, and a tendency to {681} nausea and vomiting in children and
feeble persons.The breath has a peculiarly offensive odor (spoken of
as fecal) in some instances.In cases of moderate severity it occurs in
the beginning of the illness, but declines rapidly under treatment by
rest and diet.The course of fever does not conform to any type even in
severe cases, although it so nearly resembles that of typhoid fever in
its first week as to lead to mistakes in diagnosis.The height of the
fever and its duration are measures of the extent of the lesions and
their gravity.Sudden outbursts of fever point to some complication.In
catarrh of the bowel due to cold the fever is higher than when
indigestion is the cause.In very feeble persons, in children, and in
any case from neglect and improper feeding the body-heat may be very
high.Very little disturbance of
the nervous system is seen except in young and old patients; some
headache and restlessness are all that may be observed.Moderate
delirium at night accompanies very acute attacks.In children
convulsions are not unusual in the onset and at the end of the attack.In the aged exhaustion from the illness soon lapses into stupor or
coma.Paraplegia and contraction of the muscles of the extremities are
referred by some observers to gastro-intestinal inflammation.[25]

[Footnote 25: Potain, _Le Praticien_, Paris, 1879-80, p.In uncomplicated mild cases of intestinal catarrh there is a movement
toward recovery after a few days' illness.The stools become less
frequent, smaller, and more consistent.In a week to ten days the
tongue cleans, the thirst ceases, the appetite returns, the tympanites
and pain diminish.The fever declines, and ceases before the diarrhoea
is completely arrested.There are always more or less emaciation and
loss of strength from the fever and arrest of nutrition.The liability
to relapse is great, and the patient by indiscretions reproduces the
same symptoms, thus prolonging the attack for several weeks.Acute
intestinal catarrh may pass into the chronic form by a disappearance of
fever and amelioration of all the abdominal symptoms.The patient
begins to take solid food, gains strength and flesh, but complete
recovery does not come.The diarrhoea recurs at variable intervals as
the result of indulgences in a mixed diet, over-exercise, or exposure
to cold, and in time we have some degree of chronic catarrh permanently
established.Very mild cases may be prolonged by the neglect of the patient to
consider his painless diarrhoea of sufficient moment to need attention.In inflammation of the more intense kind the picture is somewhat
different.The prodromes are longer and the general symptoms more
severe.Restlessness, a sense of prostration, delirium, and high fever
mark the early stages and continue for a longer time.The patient loses
flesh and strength quickly.The features express anxiety and illness,
the skin is hot and dry, and the thirst great.Borborygmi, the tension of the abdomen, pain, and sensibility to
pressure are all intensified.The stools are at first yellow and thin,
but change much from day to day.They may be green or very thin and
dark or grayish, and are sometimes very offensive in odor.Blood and
mucus may be seen in them, being slimy or grumous and bloody.When the
patient is very weak the discharges are involuntary; the tongue is
coated white, with bright red tip and edges, and is often dry.{682} The severer forms last from three to six weeks.After a tedious
period of alternate improvement and relapse the illness becomes chronic
or the patient dies from asthenia, perforation and peritonitis, or some
other complication.In the most intense varieties which find examples among Europeans and
Americans in intertropical countries, or result from acute mineral
poisoning and from rapidly-progressing cases of acute ulceration of the
intestinal wall, especially in children, there is a sharper and more
violent invasion.The strength is reduced in a very short time, and
there is rapid emaciation; the features assume an anxious expression;
the complexion is leaden or livid; the skin is cold and clammy; the
pulse is small, weak, and rapid; the breath comes quick and short, and
is frequently complicated with hiccough.In the early stages vomiting
occurs, due to a concurrent gastritis; in cases of poisoning vomiting
is incessant.The pain in the abdomen is intense, and less paroxysmal than in other
forms.The abdomen is tympanitic and excessively tender to the touch,
and the knees are drawn up to relieve the tension of the abdominal
muscles.Thin, black, or reddish stools are passed every few moments.As the attack progresses the urine is suppressed, the voice becomes
whispering, and collapse is developed.This is marked by cold
extremities, dyspnoea, feeble and finally imperceptible pulse.Death
may end the scene in a few hours or the patient may rally and recover
slowly.Choleriform diarrhoea occurs chiefly in children during hot weather.VARIETIES DUE TO SEAT.--The symptoms and progress of acute catarrh of
the intestines present numerous differences depending upon the seat of
the inflammation.The symptomatology already given is that of the most
common form (ileo-colitis), in which the lower part of the ileum and a
considerable portion of the colon are simultaneously involved.Many
cases no doubt occur in which the disease is limited and in which early
recovery is the rule.The pathological anatomy of cases of generalized
catarrh is better known, as they form the bulk of the fatal cases.I. Acute Duodenitis.--The most common form of duodenitis is that in
which the inflammation spreads by continuity of tissue from the stomach
to the duodenum, as in acute gastric catarrh after a debauch.The
prominence of the gastric symptoms disguises the intestinal lesion,
unless the catarrh, as is frequently the case, extends into and
obstructs the common bile-duct and its branches, and suddenly develops
icterus with clayey stools and altered urine.Besides icterus, a
careful isolation of symptoms will show that some cannot be attributed
to the stomach: there is a dull pain seated in the right hypochondrium,
extending to the right shoulder or shoulder-blade, which is increased
by pressure upon the region of the duodenum.As the gastric symptoms
improve there is no change in the icterus, which continues for some
days or weeks longer.The connection between burns of the integument
and ulcer of the duodenum is well known.Symptoms of perforation, with
death, may be the first sign of this lesion, but vomiting of blood,
icterus, purging of blood, indigestion, and cardialgia occur from
duodenal ulcers.The typical acute duodenitis described by authors as an independent
{683} affection is of rare occurrence.An epidemic of duodenitis[26]
has been reported where many persons were simultaneously attacked, all
the cases having had the same traits--headache, pain in the line of the
duodenum at the left edge of the right hypochondrium, pain in the first
and second lumbar vertebrae, constipation, jaundice, slow pulse, and
mental depression.Gangrenous inflammation of the duodenum[27] has been
once seen, and produced a chill, a severe sense of weight and pain in
the epigastrium, retching and eructations of gas, tenderness on
pressure, frequent pulse, and high temperature.There was obstinate
constipation, with dyspnoea, death ensuing in a few days.At the
autopsy gangrenous inflammation of the duodenum was found, which ended
abruptly twelve inches from the pylorus.There was a large gall-stone
in the gall-bladder.[Footnote 26: McGaughey, _Philada.407; also, T. N. Reynolds, _Detroit Clinic_, June 7, 1882, p.[Footnote 27: Eskridge, _Philada.A fatal case of duodenitis is recorded[28] in which the following
symptoms were observed: sudden and severe pain in the right
hypochondrium, increased by pressure; rigors, vomiting and purging of a
green flocculent fluid, and later of blood; jaundice, fever, delirium,
collapse, and death.The pylorus and two-thirds of the duodenal mucous
membrane were much inflamed and the orifice of the bile-duct closed.[Footnote 28: _Die Krankheiten des Duodenums_, Mayer, quoted by Leube
in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, Am.Acute Ileitis, Acute Jejunitis.--When the ileum, with or without
the jejunum, is the seat of catarrh, diarrhoea may not be present,
provided the inflammation is slight and there is no increase of colon
peristalsis.The symptoms then are borborygmi, pain and fulness about
and below the umbilicus or between it and the right ileum, especially
after eating, and the general symptoms arising from indigestion and
malnutrition.Fever is slight or absent; there are malaise and loss of
strength.They contain unaltered
bile and fragments of muscular fibre and starch-granules in excess of
the quantity found in health.An increased quantity of mucus, diffused
evenly in a fluid evacuation, or globules of mucus stained with bile,
or bile-stained epithelium, denote inflammation confined to the small
intestine.A larger amount of indican in the urine than is normally
present is a sign of the same lesion.[29]

[Footnote 29: These conclusions are based upon the results of one
thousand examinations of feces made by H. Nothnagel, and reported in
_Zur Klinik der Darmkrankheiten; Zeitschrift fur klin.Medicin_, iv.,
1882, p.Intense inflammation of the small intestine may exist without diarrhoea
or other symptoms betokening the real nature of the attack.Flint[30]
mentions having met with three such instances, and Goodhart[31] records
thirteen cases of enteritis with marked lesions in which no diagnosis
had been made before death.Rilliet and Barthez report twenty-four
autopsies in children with intestinal lesions in which no symptoms had
been observed.[32]

[Footnote 30: _Clinical Medicine_, Philada., 1879, p.[Footnote 31: _Guy's Hospital Gazette_, Sept., 1878, p.98 _et seq._]

[Footnote 32: _Maladies des Enfants_, Paris, 1861, tome i. p.Acute Colitis.--Fifty years ago colitis was synonymous with
enteritis, and not with dysentery, as at a more recent date.[33] The
older {684} signification expressed the fact that inflammation in the
colon is essential to diarrhoea.Later the term was used synonymously
with dysentery.[34]

[Footnote 33: _Journal general de Medecine_, Paris, 1825, t. xci.[Footnote 34: Tweedie, _System of the Practice of Medicine_, 1841.]The colon is a conducting tube; the contents are composed of matters
unabsorbed in the small intestines.At first the mass entering the
colon is fluid, but by the gradual absorption of its watery part it
approaches solidity.The discharge from the rectum of a fluid shows
that the propulsion through the large intestine is so rapid that the
process of drying does not take place, or that from inflammation of the
colon there is an excess of fluid transudation from the intestinal
wall.The superficial position of the colon, its great size and length,
expose it to the action of external cold, to blows, etc.In catarrh limited to the colon there are essentially the same symptoms
as in ileo-colitis, inasmuch as the inflammation of the colon gives to
that form its characteristic features--borborygmi, diarrhoea, and
tympanites.When the disease in the colon preponderates or exists
alone, the pain and tenderness are more superficial and confined to the
line of the large intestine.The distended colon projects and the
abdominal swelling is not so uniform.If the attack is subacute or
mild, the stools contain normal feces mixed with a great deal of mucus;
when the inflammation is in the sigmoid flexure, pure mucus is passed.Blood mixed with mucus and tenesmus accompany inflammation low down.Blood may, however, come from intense inflammation of the ascending and
transverse colon without disease of the lower bowel.[35]

[Footnote 35: In a case seen by the writer of colitis terminating
fatally from perforation of the transverse colon this point was
illustrated.A woman aged fifty was taken with diarrhoea in August,
1873.In November the symptoms became worse: tongue dry and red;
abdominal pain; tympanites; frequent stools, ten to seventeen in
twenty-four hours; quantity large, of a yellow or brownish-red color
with floating flakes.General symptoms grew worse; blood in stools from
time to time.November 24, sudden cessation of discharges from the
bowels, and the following day sudden collapse and death.Autopsy:
Descending colon and sigmoid flexure comparatively healthy.Transverse
colon adherent to stomach; deposits of lymph on colon and small
intestines; fluid and feces in the peritoneal cavity.The mucous
membrane of the ascending and transverse colon in a state of black
pulpy disintegration.In the transverse colon the walls were thinned by
ulceration and easily torn; gangrenous appearance of mucous coat;
perforation of the colon wall below greater curvature of the stomach.]Proctitis.--The rectum may be the seat of simple catarrh, which
differs in its symptoms from catarrh of other portions of the canal.By
many this form is called simple, non-infective dysentery.But as it is
a form of intestinal catarrh, it is right that it should be considered
in connection with colitis.The first indication of its onset is a
frequent desire to go to stool, with an unsatisfied feeling after each
effort.Normal fecal matter is first expelled in solid form, coated
with mucus which may be streaked with blood.Soon, however, the
discharges consist of jelly-like mucus, alone or mixed with blood.A
small quantity of this is passed with tenesmus at short intervals.The
patient complains of a burning feeling in the rectum and a constant and
irresistible desire to strain.The same spasmodic contraction may
involve the bladder.It usually ends in
recovery spontaneously or under treatment by the cessation of the mucus
and blood and the discharge of normal fecal matter.DIAGNOSIS.--A combination of the symptoms described as belonging to
inflammation of the small and large intestine gives the most common
{685} form of intestinal catarrh, ileo-colitis.This union is diagnosed
by the following symptoms: fever; general distension of the abdomen;
paroxysmal pains starting from the umbilicus, but having a general
distribution; noisy movements of gas; diarrhoea, the stools being
large, thin, stained more or less with bile, containing more or less
mucus intimately mixed with fluid matter and with particles of
partially-digested or unaltered food.It is possible in many cases to
recognize the part of the intestinal canal which is the seat of disease
from differences in symptoms which have already been described.But
great care in observation is needed, combined with a minute inspection
and microscopical examination of the stools, to arrive at accurate and
well-founded conclusions.Acute follicular ulceration may be thought to have begun if after a
week or more of illness thin and sometimes putrescent stools are passed
containing small blood-coagula, with mucus and pus.[36] This opinion
would be confirmed by an increase in abdominal tenderness and the
persistence of the diarrhoea or tendency to relapse notwithstanding
careful treatment and diet.The transition of the disease into the
chronic form would give additional support to this view of the nature
of the lesion.[37]

[Footnote 36: "The intestinal mucous membrane, especially that of the
small intestine, scarcely ever produces pus without ulceration"
(Virchow's _Cellular Pathology_, Philada., 1863, p.[Footnote 37: For a more detailed account of the symptoms and diagnosis
of follicular ulceration see article on CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.]Some or all of the symptoms of acute intestinal catarrh are, however,
found in other diseases.It is well, therefore, to devote some
attention to differential diagnosis, giving a resume of the salient
points of distinction.Typhoid fever in many of its features resembles intestinal catarrh, and
in many cases is confounded with it.Until within quite recent times
the symptoms of typhoid fever were grouped under the names
gastro-enteritis and follicular enteritis.In the first week of the
illness there is reasonable ground for delay in making a positive
diagnosis.Etiological data are here of great help.The occurrence of
the symptoms in children under two years and in adults beyond fifty
years points strongly to intestinal catarrh.Spring and early summer
are the seasons for diarrhoea; typhoid belongs to late summer and to
autumn.A sudden onset after errors in diet or exposure to cold, with
the early development of pain in the bowels, rumbling of gas,
diarrhoea, would be easily recognized as a local disorder.In typhoid
fever there is a less sudden onset, with prodromal debility, anaemia,
indigestion, and nocturnal fever.To these symptoms the diarrhoea,
which is attended with little or no pain, plays a very subordinate
part.In many cases of mild typhoid the development is sudden, with
rigors.A week's study of the temperature, if no rose-spots appear,
will be needed before the diagnosis can be made.There is not much
difficulty in making the distinction when the attack has reached its
second week.At this period in catarrh of the bowel the high fever,
with regular morning remissions and evening exacerbations, is not
constant, as in typhoid fever; there is tenderness on pressure over the
abdomen and gurgling, but no great meteorism; sibilant rales are not
heard in the chest; there are no rose-spots; rarely cerebral symptoms
except insomnia; and delirium is uncommon.The prostration is proportioned to the diarrhoea, and is by no means as
{686} great as at the same period in enteric fever.The colicky pains
preceding and accompanying the stools are a more marked feature of
intestinal catarrh; they are absent in enteric fever or have a feeble
intensity.In children between the ages of two and seven years there are certain
peculiarities which augment the difficulties of diagnosis.Intestinal
catarrh in them is accompanied by an abundant, frequently painless
diarrhoea, by tympanites, cerebral disturbances, a dry and coated
tongue, with sordes on the lips and gums, and by a rapidly-developed
anaemia, emaciation, and exhaustion.Typhoid fever in children of this
age is generally benignant; vomiting is more common than in adults;
high grades of meteorism are infrequent; tenderness of the caecal
region is determined with greater difficulty; and severe nervous
phenomena and fatal intestinal complications rarely occur.[38] In other
words, in young children intestinal catarrh by its severity and enteric
fever by its benignity more nearly approach each other than in adults;
in many instances the diagnosis must be undecided until late in the
attack.[Footnote 38: Consult "Diseases of Children," Henoch, _Wood's Library_,
New York, 1882, p.Typhoid fever can of course be known if rose-spots, a splenic tumor, or
the characteristic delirium are manifested, or if the fever-curve
conforms to the type; but in children all these symptoms may be
negative; even the fever has great variability.If fever is continued
beyond ten days, and is accompanied by progressive anaemia and
emaciation and debility, the attack is enteric fever if all local
causes of fever can be excluded.There is no minimum limit to the
temperature in typhoid fever, and no matter how low the maxima of the
fastigium may be, typhoid fever cannot be excluded.[39]

[Footnote 39: Johnston, "On the Diagnosis of Mild Cases of Typhoid
Fever," _Am.Sci._, Oct., 1875, p.372; also, "On the Mild
Forms of Continued Fever in Washington," _Am.Sci._, Oct.,
1882, p.The large watery stools and the absence of tenesmus mark the difference
between diarrhoea and dysentery.Blood may be present in colitis, owing
to a high grade of inflammation and to ulceration.Simple catarrh of
the rectum, proctitis, is not readily distinguished from infective
dysentery.Small mucous and bloody stools may be catarrhal.In the
present state of our knowledge dysentery would be known by marked
tenesmus, by the grave general symptoms, the reddish fluid stools with
flocculi, and by its occurrence in epidemic form.Enteralgia presents the following features which distinguish it from
intestinal catarrh: The tongue in enteralgia is clean or coated white,
but with no red tip and edges; the appetite is capricious, but not
lost; the bowels are constipated; the pain bears no relation to the
ingestion of food or drink, as in enteritis.Fever is accidental, and
there are other nervous phenomena.In lead colic there is no fever,
tympanites, nor diarrhoea.In rheumatism of the abdominal walls the
pain is superficial and sharp, not griping, and is increased by
movements of the trunk.The digestive system is in no way disordered.From peritonitis intestinal catarrh is distinguished by a less degree
of illness and by its usually favorable result, by diarrhoea, a greater
freedom in movement, and by a less degree of suffering on palpating the
abdomen.Tympanites, constipation, great tenderness on pressure over
the abdomen, and a small, quick pulse, point to peritonitis.{687} PROGNOSIS.--A simple intestinal catarrh of the form first
described involves no danger, and if treated by rest and diet soon
recovers.The more severe form, beginning as a primary disease, when
rationally treated ends in recovery in most instances.Unfavorable predisposing causes are--a hot climate (India, the West
Indies, and intertropical climates in general); very hot weather of the
summer and autumn months; a very early or very advanced age; the
contaminated atmosphere of prisons, camps, etc.; all bad hygienic
influences; and previous or coexisting illness.When diarrhoea occurs
as a complication of the acute infectious diseases it has a special
gravity.In typhoid fever, scarlatina, measles, acute tuberculosis,
etc.During the progress
of chronic general diseases (malaria, scurvy, tuberculosis) it becomes
an obstinate and sometimes a fatal complication.Among the exciting
causes mineral poisons induce the most dangerous form of intestinal
catarrh.Unfavorable symptoms occurring during the course of acute
diarrhoea are the early development of high temperature, cerebral
disturbance, great sensibility to pressure over the abdomen, thin and
bloody or highly offensive stools, involuntary discharges, and very
rapid emaciation and loss of strength.TREATMENT.--There have been many fluctuations of opinion as to the
relative value of modes of treatment in this disease.Various
therapeutic measures have been suggested which, after enjoying favor
for a time, have been abandoned, and revived after long periods of
disfavor.Venesection was alternately recommended and forbidden.Emetics and evacuants, mercurials, diuretics, diaphoretics, have been
in turn warmly supported and vigorously opposed.Opium, belladonna, the
various astringents, and cinchona-bark have run through many changes of
favor.Individual drugs give curious evidence of inconstancy.Oxide of
zinc, suggested by James Adair in 1785 and by Hendy in 1784, after a
hundred years of weak approval is commended highly by Penrose (1863),
Brakenridge, and Mackey (1873),[40] and by more recent writers.Acetate
of lead, which dates back to Paracelsus, had varying fortunes of repute
and disrepute.In the end of the seventeenth century it had a name for
curing diarrhoea, but in the following century it was spoken of by
Boerhaave as a deceitful and destructive poison, and Cullen in 1789
said that hardly any one then thought of using lead internally.[41] In
1799 it had warm advocates in this country; among them, Thomas Ewall of
Washington, who wrote in 1808.Since then it has come into very general
use and favor, which it still holds.[Footnote 40: J. J. Woodward, _op.780 _et seq._]

In view of the many changes of faith in systems of treatment and in
drugs, we have no right to assume that we have as yet reached the
perfection of treatment.In fact, experience brings the conviction that
our systems are quite imperfect and that drugs fail in our hands when
they are most needed.The prophylactic treatment is of importance, especially in children,
delicate persons, and in those suffering from disease or predisposed by
idiosyncrasy to intestinal catarrh.Directions must be given by the
physician as to the food for children appropriate to their age and
digestive capacity.Summer heat and city life being so fatal to them,
they should {688} be sent to the cool climate of the seashore or
mountains during the first and second years of life.In warm weather
laxatives should not be given to children, except with precautions
against their acting too freely; the same rule applies to the aged.Too
great care in diet in older children predisposes to indigestion and
diarrhoea.Variety in food is of service, therefore.It is not well to
give children food prepared so as to do away with the necessity for
mastication and for active gastric movements.All reasonable care should be used not to take
food in excess of the individual's power of digestion.Unripe fruit,
stale vegetables or fruits, cheese, pork, shellfish which are not
absolutely fresh, are among the aliments which may produce diarrhoea,
and are to be avoided.Many people have to be told what food is
unsuited to them, and certain articles of food in individual cases
invariably excite diarrhoea.Alcohol is often to be blamed for
diarrhoeas which are attributed to indigestible food, and frequent
recurrences of intestinal catarrh can only be prevented by abandoning
stimulants altogether.The bad effects of sudden changes in temperature
are warded off by wearing flannel next to the body.This is an
important rule for adults as for children.Even in summer thin flannel
or gauze gives protection.Well-ventilated rooms, good house-drainage,
personal cleanliness, with all other hygienic aids, are means of
prevention.Persistent disinfection of sources of air- and
water-contamination should be practised, especially in hot weather.In
the country the open privies and wells need frequent clearing out.Cases of fatal diarrhoea are met with in elevated regions where the
continued low temperature renders it improbable that heat could have
anything to do with their causation.[42] Water should not be used which
could in any way be tainted with soakage from privies, barnyards, or
other places where animal decomposition is going on.[43] Avoiding the
use of cathartics in the onset of acute illness, the nature of which is
not known, is a useful prophylactic measure.A fatal diarrhoea may
result from injudicious purging in such cases.Care in the use of
laxatives should be observed in the chronic wasting
diseases--tuberculosis, rachitis, cancer, etc.[Footnote 42: The yearly occurrence of typhoid fever and diarrhoea at
seashore hotels shows that there is great danger in crowding persons
together and saturating the soil with the excreta.In the summer of
1882 in a boarding-house in the mountains of Maryland, where the
temperature was never above 75 degrees, there were three fatal cases of
diarrhoea in children, and several others of diarrhoea and dysentery
which recovered.][Footnote 43: The drinking-water supplying a country boarding-house
visited by the writer passed through iron pipes imbedded in the
manure-heap of a barnyard.]The selection of a plan of treatment for intestinal catarrh will depend
upon the nature and cause of the symptoms.The diagnosis of the case is
incomplete and the treatment irrational until the indications furnished
by etiology have been obtained.If cold has been the exciting cause, the patient should be confined to
bed.In the beginning a full dose of pilocarpin, hypodermically,[44] or
of the fluid extract of jaborandi by the mouth, may cause a powerful
diversion from the bowel to the skin.A hot-water or vapor bath has the
same object in view.Hot fomentations or mustard poultices can be next
applied to the abdomen.This should be succeeded by a febrifuge {689}
mixture containing the tincture of aconite-root, to which an opiate
(the deodorized tincture of opium or morphia) is to be added if there
is much pain or diarrhoea.A hypodermic injection of morphia given on
the first day of the attack immediately after a hot bath will give a
quiet night and diminish the intensity of the illness.The subsequent
treatment is that common to all the acute forms.[Footnote 44: Atropia can be given with pilocarpin to diminish its
effect on the heart; atropia is the antidote for pilocarpin.(See
Schuk, _Centralb.357; also,
Frohnmuller, _Med.-Chir.Centralb._, July 14, 1882.)]If summer heat has been the cause in adults or children, artificial
cooling of the temperature of the room by the evaporation of ice-water
or by one of the refrigerating machines yet to be perfected meet the
indication.If there is much body-heat (thermic fever), cold sponging,
the application of cold to the head, or the giving of pounded ice to
satisfy the intense thirst, are all advisable.Such cases are benefited
by a change of climate when the acute symptoms subside.The form of
diarrhoea due to malaria is to be treated by quinia and change of air
to a more healthful climate.Iron, with quinia or arsenic, is needed in
obstinate cases.Intestinal catarrh which proceeds from the presence of undigested food
or hard fecal lumps in the bowel is benefited by early removal of the
irritating cause.It is not often that substances of this kind are
retained when the stools are large and frequent.The peristalsis is
here as active as it need be, and no good, but only harm, can come from
over-stimulating the contractile muscles.In those instances where
there is a distinct history of the taking of indigestible food,
especially fruit with seeds or skins, and where the efforts at stool
are frequent, ineffectual, and accompanied by colic and borborygmi, or
where scybalae are found floating in the fluid passed, a large enema of
warm water given slowly will excite the bowel to successful expulsive
efforts.If this does not give a certain amount of prompt relief, a
moderate dose of castor oil, calomel, Rochelle or Epsom salts ought to
be prescribed, and repeated after some hours until a free fluid or
semi-fluid stool results; one or two doses will usually suffice.If the
inflammation is localized in the caecum (typhlitis), as indicated by
local pain, tenderness on pressure in the right iliac or right lumbar
regions, constipation, flexing of the right thigh on the trunk, and
vomiting, a purgative should not be given, nor should prolonged efforts
be made to empty the bowel by injection through long rectal tubes.If
there is doubt as to whether typhlitis or undigested food and fecal
impaction is the cause of the local pain, it is better to err on the
safe side, and not to give a purgative unless the case is seen in the
onset before the more pronounced symptoms appear; then calomel or
castor oil may be tried once, but not repeated in case of failure.As the diarrhoea of Bright's disease is salutary, no effort should be
made to arrest it.In
tuberculosis the special character of the diarrhoea must be considered,
and every effort must be made to control it.In the eruptive fevers an
early diarrhoea, as in scarlet fever, does harm; it delays or prevents
the normal development of the eruption.In the later stages it is of
service sometimes, as in measles, when it leads to a rapid fall of
temperature.The course of action depends upon the nature of the
specific disease and upon the time of the appearance of diarrhoea.There are certain principles, founded on the knowledge derived from
pathological study and from the experience of the past in the treatment
{690} of intestinal catarrh, which guide us to a treatment which is
more or less rational in all cases.Rest is essential to the cure of the inflamed intestine, but absolute
inertia of the bowel is undesirable, even injurious.The retention of
fluids, transuded serum, bile, intestinal juices, and partly-altered
food is hurtful.Decomposition sets in and gas is developed, which by
distending the bowel causes great suffering and increases the
inflammation.The movements of the intestine are not entirely under
control; the patient must be fed; digestion and assimilation involve
the activity of inflamed parts.The stomach can be made to do most of
the work, but the sympathy of action is so close between the stomach
and intestines that one cannot function without the other being excited
into activity.The first rule of treatment is to put the patient to bed and to keep
him in a horizontal position.Even in mild cases time will be saved by
resorting to absolute rest at once.If the attack is at all severe, the
bed-pan should be used; the effort to rise and the straining at stool
exaggerate peristaltic movement, increasing the frequency of the
evacuations.Additional rest can be given to the intestines by applying
a flannel binder around the trunk, compressing the abdomen; broad
strips of adhesive plaster could be used for the same purpose.In cases
where the diarrhoea, tympanites, and griping pain are not relieved by
other measures this suggestion may be of service.In order to lessen intestinal hyperaemia and allay suffering,
counter-irritants and soothing external applications are employed.Local blood-letting, although in vogue during more than two centuries,
has fallen into disuse.Recent authors still continue to advise the
application of leeches to the anus in order to deplete the portal
circulation,[45] but it is a decided objection to this remedy that the
fluid stools irritate the leech-bites and cause much discomfort.Sinapisms or turpentine stupes may be of some service apart from the
relief which they give to pain.Blisters might be more generally used
than they are when the tenderness on pressure is confined to the colon.Hot poultices of
flaxseed meal or hot fomentations of any sort applied over the entire
abdomen have a soothing and beneficial effect.A flannel compress
saturated with alcohol and covered with gutta-percha cloth makes a most
agreeable application.[Footnote 45: Niemeyer, _Practice of Medicine, Intestinal Catarrh_.]The directions for diet should be carefully and explicitly given.In
the onset of the attack entire deprivation of all food for twenty-four
or forty-eight hours is expedient.To relieve thirst, cracked ice,
carbonic-acid water, Apollinaris, Seltzer, or Deep Rock water can be
ordered; barley- or rice-water is slightly nourishing and relieves
thirst, but all liquids should be given in moderation.When it becomes
necessary to give food, the stomach must be made to do the work of
digestion, and, as far as possible, of absorption also.Such substances
are to be chosen as are converted in the stomach into peptones, and
which do not require contact with the intestinal juices for their
absorption.The peptones transformed in the stomach from nitrogenous alimentary
principles are highly soluble and diffusible.Milk is better suited to
the conditions of intestinal catarrh than any other nitrogenous food.It is palatable, relieves the thirst, and can be taken for a long time
without {691} aversion.By removing the cream, the fat, which would
require intestinal digestion, is partly got rid of.Skimmed milk does
not produce a feeling of distaste and what is called biliousness, as
does milk unskimmed.In cases where there is gastric catarrh the milk
can be made more digestible by adding an equal quantity of barley-water
or rice-water.The casein is then more slowly acted on by the gastric
juice and more thoroughly digested.Milk should be given in small
quantities at short intervals, as in this way the stomach performs the
entire work more thoroughly.If a large quantity is given, a portion of
it passes into the intestine unaltered.Buttermilk contains less fatty
matter than skimmed milk, and is a pleasant substitute for it.Koumiss,
if it could be properly prepared, would be an excellent food for
diarrhoea.Even the imperfect imitations are retained and digested when
other aliments fail.The whey of milk contains lactin, salts, a little
casein, and fatty matter.It may be made by adding to milk rennet,
sherry or other wine, cream of tartar, tamarind-juice, or alum.Milk-whey is slightly nourishing, and is said to be sudorific; when
prepared with wine it is a mild stimulant well suited to the cases of
children.Where it is desired to give as little work to the digestive organs as
is possible, milk and other foods can be given already partly digested,
as peptonized milk prepared according to the formulae of Roberts and
Fothergill.[46] Eggs are changed quickly in the stomach.Egg albumen is
more easily digested by artificial gastric juice than by pancreatic
extract (Roberts).A solution of egg albumen boiled in the water-bath
is swiftly and entirely transformed by pepsin and hydrochloric acid.Raw eggs have been thought to be the most digestible, but Roberts found
that a solution of egg albumen when raw was very slowly acted on by
pepsin and acid, but after being cooked it was rapidly and entirely
digested.Eggs are best given, therefore, boiled slightly at a slow
heat; when an egg is plunged in boiling water the white sets hard,
leaving the yelk soft.The albumen of the white and the yelk should be
equally cooked throughout.[Footnote 46: J. M. Fothergill, _Indigestion and Biliousness_, New
York, 1881, p.63 _et seq._ See also quote to article on CHRONIC
INTESTINAL CATARRH.]Beef-tea is said by the chemist to possess little nutritive value;
practical experience convinces the physician that it supports life.Peptonized beef-tea may be substituted when thought best.Animal broths
thickened with rice, barley, or with peptonized gruel, as advised by
Fothergill, or with the addition of vermicelli, are valuable aids when
the palate is capricious.Raw beef is not as digestible as when the
tendinous and aponeurotic structures of the muscular fibre have been
softened, disintegrated, and converted into the soluble and
easily-digested form of gelatin by cooking.[47] Scraped raw beef, when
the pulp is removed from much of the connective tissue, is easily
digested by children as well as by adults.In most cases of acute intestinal catarrh the patient can be well
sustained by a diet consisting of one or other of the aliments
described.For the largest number milk alone--that is, skimmed milk or
milk diluted with barley-water, rice-water, or Seltzer water--is all
that is necessary to support strength during the attack.Although
starch after deglutition is {692} acted on in the intestine only, it
becomes desirable sometimes to give farinaceous food in some form or
other; milk may be undigested and animal broths may become distasteful;
the palate craves some change.In this case a blanc mange made after
the formula of Meigs and Pepper is as well suited to adults as to
children,[48] the proportion of cream and arrowroot being made larger
for adults.Sago[49] and tapioca[50] can be tried to tempt the palate.The flour of the Egyptian lentil[51] is made into a gruel also.Most of
the patent foods for infants and invalids contain starch in some form
or other.Racahout is one of the pleasantest and best of these.Nestle's food contains baked biscuits of wheat flour ground to a
powder.Liebig's food is made of wheat flour, malt flour, and a little
bicarbonate of potassium.Revalenta Arabica is an attractive name for
the flour of Arabian lentil with barley flour.Any of these may be
advantageously employed in cases of some duration and in the later
stages of convalescence.[Footnote 48: Meigs and Pepper, _Diseases of Children_, Philada., 1870,
p.[Footnote 49: Put half an ounce of sago into an enamelled saucepan with
three-quarters of a pint of cold water, and boil gently for an hour and
a quarter.Skim when it comes to the boil, and stir frequently.Sweeten
with a dessertspoonful of sifted loaf sugar.If wine be ordered, two
dessertspoonfuls; and if brandy, one dessertspoonful.][Footnote 50: Half an ounce of the best tapioca to a pint and a quarter
of new milk.Simmer gently for two hours and a quarter, stirring
frequently; sweeten with a dessertspoonful of sifted sugar.][Footnote 51: Take three tablespoonfuls of lentil flour, a
salt-spoonful of salt, and one pint of water.Mix the flour and salt
into a paste with the water and boil ten minutes, stirring (_Food for
the Invalid_, Fothergill and Wood, New York, 1880).]The diet for convalescence should be controlled by the physician until
the patient has been well for at least two weeks.Liquid preparations
give place to fine hominy, corn meal or oatmeal porridge, with milk.Then bread or crackers may be given, the intervals between the meals
increasing to three or four hours.Raw oysters, sweetbreads, tender
rare steak or mutton finely divided and well masticated, rice, and ripe
peaches, succeed the simpler diet.Much saccharine, starchy, or fatty
food is to be avoided for at least two weeks after entire recovery.When the indications derived from the study of the cause have been
acted on, and the patient has been placed under a rigid discipline of
rest and diet, the treatment of symptoms comes next in order.In mild cases, where the cause has been irritating ingesta, diet may
relieve the symptoms in a short time without medicine.If diarrhoea
with slight colicky pains and flatulence continue after a few hours, a
mixture holding in suspension subnitrate of bismuth, with five drops of
the deodorized tincture of opium in each dose, or a pill of lead and
opium, will suffice in a short time to give relief.In severer attacks
the fever heat may mount to a high point, giving great distress to the
patient.If a temperature of 103 degrees to 104 degrees F. is
reached--which is not unusual in children--a warm bath is a sedative
and antipyretic remedy, or a bath of 95 degrees can be gradually cooled
down to 75 degrees or 65 degrees F.--a procedure which will bring down
the body-heat two or three degrees.A substitution for the bath is
sponging with cool or cold water, to which vinegar or bay rum may be
added; or towels wrung out of cold water can be applied to the trunk
and extremities (Ringer) with a very happy effect.Quinia can be used antipyretically in full doses, dissolved in dilute
hydrochloric acid.Pills, especially the sugar- or gelatin-coated
pills, {693} should not be given, as they irritate the mucous membrane
whether they are dissolved or not.In diarrhoea quinia pills often pass
unaltered.Flatulence, eructations of gas, and borborygmi are controlled by strict
diet according to the rules given.Bismuth subnitrate or subcarbonate
unites with sulphuretted hydrogen and absorbs it.The alkalies, sodium
and potassium bicarbonate, sodium hyposulphite, the aromatic spirits of
ammonia, either relieve acidity or prevent fermentation and the
development of gas.A satisfactory formula for the early stages of
intestinal catarrh is one containing bismuth subcarbonate, sodium
bicarbonate, aromatic spirits of ammonia in water or cinnamon-water.When the abdominal distension is great enough to be a cause of
distress, external cold--dry cold--is the best, applied with a rubber
bag filled with cracked ice or ice-water; it causes absorption of gas.Abdominal compression with a bandage may be of some service also.Mineral acids, especially the dilute hydrochloric acid, by affording
aid to the digestion prevent acid fermentation.Diarrhoea is the central symptom and the best standard by which to
measure the intensity of the catarrh and its progress.But it is only a
symptom, and the mind ought to be directed to the lesion and not to it.Having the cause in view, the object in all cases is to allay the
inflammation.This done, the diarrhoea decreases, then ceases.Shall
the effort be made to check the discharges, or shall they be allowed to
continue?The evacuant plan of treatment has been advocated, on the
ground that the purgative, by increasing intestinal secretion, relieves
the congestion of the intestinal blood-vessels and leaves the membrane
in a better state than before.[52] But inasmuch as a purgative only
acts by bringing about an intestinal hyperaemia and catarrh, there is
no good reason for, and many reasons against, treatment by evacuation.A preliminary purgative, as has already been stated, is necessary to
expel undigested food and scybalae, but for the purpose of increasing
intestinal or biliary secretion and diminishing engorgement of the
vessels this method is unsuccessful and unnecessary.When irritating
substances have been removed (and this is done usually without the
physician's aid by the spontaneous expulsive movements of the bowel)
the effort to check the discharge and to give rest is one and the same.Opium is the one invaluable remedy which we cannot do without.[53] As
little of it should be given as is necessary to relieve the intensity
of the symptoms.The aim should not be to stop the pain and check
diarrhoea, but to take the edge off the sharp agony and to lengthen the
interval between the stools.Thus gradually the spasms of peristalsis
cease, and there is a diminution, and finally cessation, of the fluid
accumulation in the bowel.The diarrhoea is relieved entirely in a
period ranging from an hour after the giving of the first dose to one
week, according to the severity of the attack.Opium is given in pill
form, in the deodorized tincture, Dover's powder, or one of the salts
of morphia may be preferred.Any of these may be combined with antacid
and antifermentative mixtures, relieving the colic, gaseous distension,
and diarrhoea.If opium is combined with, {694} or followed by,
evacuants, its effects are thwarted, and it might as well not be given
at all.[Footnote 53: The objections urged against opium, that it increases
thirst and nervousness, causes a retention of fermenting products,
produces opium intoxication, and that it is a routine practice to give
it, and does not cure the inflammation, may be valid, but we cannot do
without opium, nevertheless.]It is the custom to combine astringents with opium, but in acute cases
of short duration it is a question whether astringents do not do more
harm than good.When good does come from the combination, it is the
opium which acts promptly and decidedly.The astringent lags behind,
and in cases of some duration and severity supplements the work of the
active partner.Bismuth is classed under this head, although it is not
an astringent.Its action is mechanical; much that is taken is passed
from the bowel as the black sulphide, which appears as a black granular
powder in the fluid stool.This is no proof that it may not have been
of service in its transit.[54] After death, when large doses have been
given, it has been found lining the whole intestinal canal.[55] The
subnitrate or subcarbonate can be given in powder on an empty stomach
in doses of five to twenty grains alone or in combination with opium,
or it can be dispensed with alkalies in water.The enormous doses (one
hundred and fifty to nine hundred grains daily), as given by Monneret,
are useless or hurtful.The value of bismuth is based on empirical
grounds only, but it is irrational to load the bowel with an insoluble
powder which if retained must cause irritation.As the discoloration of
the stools is an objection to bismuth when it is desired to study their
character for diagnosis, oxide of zinc may be substituted for it, as
the latter is an absorbent of acids and gases.[56] Gubler has insisted
upon combining it with bicarbonate of sodium to prevent the formation
of the irritating chloride of zinc in the stomach.[57] One of the
oldest and most popular remedies tor diarrhoea is lime in the form of
the carbonate or lime-water.The officinal mistura cretae is perhaps
more generally used for children than any other remedy.Lime-water is
added with advantage to milk when given to adults as well as children.Carrara-water, made by dissolving the bicarbonate of lime with an
excess of carbonic acid, is less nauseous than liquor calcis, and may
be mixed with an equal part of milk.[58] Chalk and its preparations are
less beneficial than bismuth as astringents, but may be used merely for
their antacid effect.[Footnote 54: Headland asserted that bismuth was insoluble, but it has
been detected in the liver, in milk, in urine, and in the serum of
dropsy by Orfila, Sewald, Bergeret, and Mayencon (_Materia Med._,
Phillips, vol.[Footnote 55: Levick, _Am.Sci._, July, 1858, p.[Footnote 56: Bonamy, "Du Traitement des Diarrhees rebelles par l'Oxyde
de Zinc," _Bull.251; also, J.
Jacquier, _De l'Emploi de l'Oxyde de Zinc dans la Diarrhee_, Paris,
Thesis, 1878, No.[Footnote 57: Gubler, _Principles of Therapeutics_, Philada., 1881, p.[Footnote 58: Phillips, _Materia Medica_, vol.The sugar of lead is a valuable astringent, because unirritating and
sedative to the mucous membrane.With opium in pill form, in doses of
one to three grains, it checks diarrhoea if the inflammation has not
lasted long and is not extensive.If there are cases where the bile is
passed in quantity, it is especially called for, as it is the only
astringent which diminishes the flow of bile.The mineral acids--dilute hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric
acids--are given with some success.The first aids gastric digestion,
and in small doses with pepsin can be directed after food irrespective
of other treatment.The great repute which it has enjoyed in the
diarrhoea of typhoid is no doubt due to the improved digestion and
assimilation {695} which follow its use.The acid principle is what is
lacking in the gastric juice in fever and debility.[59] In all cases of
intestinal catarrh rapidity of gastric digestion should be sought for.Without an opiate in combination
there is little reason to hope for any result from its use; all the
suggested formulae contain opiates.[60] Dilute sulphuric acid is
thought to be more astringent than the others.If it has any efficacy,
it is due to the local astringent or alterative effect by contact with
the inflamed surface.Much testimony is to be found in its support in
cases tending to become chronic and where astringents combined with
opiates have failed after some days' trial.It should be administered
in doses of five to twenty drops in the form of mixture with mucilage
or some aromatic, as lavender and cardamom.An opiate should not be
combined with it if it is desired to test it fairly.It would be called
for when the stools are pale, abundant, watery, and alkaline.[Footnote 59: Manassein, _Virchow's Archiv_, lv., 1872, p.[Footnote 60: The favor in which nitric acid is held is due to the
advocacy of nitrous acid by Hope ("Observations on the Powerful Effects
of a Mixture containing Nitrous Acid and Opium in curing Dysentery,
Cholera, and Diarrhoea," _Edin.Nitrous acid, the same as the fuming nitric acid of the
shops, is a reddish-yellow fluid highly charged with nitrogen trioxide.Hope said that ordinary nitric acid did not produce the same effects,
and yet nitric acid is now given with the belief that it is of
service.]Calomel is of ancient repute as a remedy in the early stages of
diarrhoea.According to recent views, it acts as a sedative to the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane and checks fermentation.It should be
given in small doses (one-twelfth to one-eighth of a grain to children,
one-fourth to one-half of a grain to adults); it should not be
continued for more than two or three days.In combination with Dover's
powder it acts well, but it is doubtful which of the two remedies
should receive the greater praise for the resulting improvement.A very
small dose of the bichloride of mercury has been found beneficial by
Ringer for clayey, pasty stools or straining stools containing slime
and blood.j; Aquae fluidounce
x; a teaspoonful frequently during the day.The gray powder is not as
much thought of now as formerly; it is not so good for the early stages
of diarrhoea as calomel, but may be tried as an alterative when the
stools are green and offensive.In the vegetable materia medica there are many and ancient remedies.Tannin represents a large class, and there is nothing more than fancy
in preferring to it kino, catechu, haematoxylon, or blackberry-root.Tannin is precipitated in the stomach as an inert tannate; gallic acid
is to be preferred for this reason, and also for its pleasant taste and
less irritating effect on the mucous membrane.It is well borne by
children, even in large doses, when given with water and syrup.It is
to be hoped that the unsightly and unsavory combinations of the
astringent tinctures with chalk mixture will be soon given up.They are
given chiefly to children, who are repelled by the sight, and still
more by the taste, of such compounds.The syrup of krameria is the
least objectionable, and catechu and krameria are made into troches
which are sometimes available.Ipecacuanha is said by Bartholow to be extremely serviceable in the
diarrhoea of teething children with greenish stools containing mucus or
blood.He prescribes it with bismuth and pepsin.{696} Recently some favor has been paid to coto-bark and its active
principle, cotoin.The latter is advised to be given in the following
formula:

  Rx.Cotoinae,        gr.j;
      Aquae distillat.fluidounce iv;
      Alcohol,         gtt.x;
      Syrupi,          fluidounce j.

A tablespoonful every hour.Five to eight drops of the fluid extract of
coto are given.It is said to have a speedy and certain effect in acute
diarrhoea.[61]

[Footnote 61: Coto-bark was imported into Europe from Bolivia in 1873,
and was called quinquina coto.Wittstein of Munich and Julius Jobst of
Stuttgart made the first analyses (_Neues Repertorium fur Pharmacie_,
xxiv.Von Gietl (_idem_, xxv.)first concluded from
experiments that it was of use in diarrhoea.Cotoin and paracotoin were
separated by Jobst.It has been found successful in the treatment of
diarrhoea in Germany and of cholera in Japan (Baelz, _Centralb.Wissen._, 1878, xvi.Cotoin sometimes disturbs the
digestion to a marked degree.Paracotoin may be used hypodermically.]Salicin,[62] ergot, guarana, have all been spoken of by enthusiasts as
possessing valuable properties in diarrhoea.[Footnote 62: Lawson, "Diarrhoea and its Treatment at the London
Hospitals," _Med.122; Bishop,
"Salicin in Diarrhoea and Dysentery," _Southern Med.585; "Comparative Value of Opium and Salicin in Diarrhoea and
Dysentery," _Detroit Review of Med.Sulphate of copper is fitted for cases in
danger of passing into the chronic stage.Sulphate of zinc might be
more generally ordered than is the case.The sulphate of iron and the
fluid preparations of iron--tincture of the chloride, solution of the
pernitrite, and persulphate--are astringents, and could be tried if
other remedies fail.The effect of nitrate of silver is to constrict
vessels, to coagulate and disinfect excretions, and to form an adherent
protecting membrane (Phillips).It occupies the next place to lead, and
is suited to a subacute stage when acute symptoms have subsided.It is
warmly recommended by William Pepper and others.[63] The oxide of
silver has been preferred by some writers.[64] For the protracted
diarrhoea of children, in whom follicular ulcers form so rapidly, the
nitrate of silver is of special value.To adults it is administered in
a pill freshly made in doses of one-eighth to one grain.A solution in
distilled water with syrup answers well for children, the dose varying
from one-twentieth to one-fourth of a grain.[Footnote 63: J. Maggregor, "On the Internal Use of Nitrate of Silver
in Inflammation of the Intestines," _Lancet_, 1841, vol.[Footnote 64: Lane, _Med.-Chir.289 _et seq._;
Eyre, _The Stomach and its Difficulties_, London, 1852.]The theory of the germ origin of diarrhoea has naturally brought into
notice antiseptic remedies.Carbolic acid,[65] creasote,[66]
naphtha,[67] sulpho-carbolate of calcium,[68] salicylic acid,[69] and
chlorine-water have each been advocated.Practice does not support
their claim to be considered remedies for intestinal inflammation.[Footnote 65: Habershon, _Lancet_, London, 1868, vol.7; C. G.
Rothe, _Berliner klin.Wochenschrift_, 1871, p.583;

rejected by the stomach or when it is desired to bring the drugs into
more direct contact with the inflamed colon.Opiates, astringents, and
alteratives are employed in this way.Laudanum in two to four ounces of
warm water or in warm milk or starch-water can be thrown into the
rectum, the fluid being allowed to remain.The injections are to be
given often enough to relieve pain and lessen the number of discharges.With the laudanum, or without it, the mineral astringents can be used
by enema.Acetate of lead or sulphate of zinc is to be preferred.The
objection that but a small portion of the inflamed surface is reached
by the fluid is a valid one, and therefore those cases are most
benefited where the catarrh is in the lower colon and rectum.Ringer[70] says that it is not at all necessary for the fluid to reach
that part of the intestine which is the seat of the catarrh; the
impression made on one part is communicated to the other by sympathy.It was the practice with O'Beirne,[71] Hare,[72] and others to inject
fluid by a long flexible tube passed beyond the sigmoid flexure.This
method is advocated and employed in Europe by Mosler, Winterinz, and
Monti.Quite recently Dulles has drawn attention to irrigation of the
large intestine as a means of treating inflammation of the colon,
according to the plan of Alois Monti of Vienna.[73] Henoch has tried
with partial success in children the throwing into the rectum of a
large quantity of water holding in solution acetate of lead, alum, or
tannin.His method contemplates medication above the sigmoid flexure; a
part of the fluid escapes, while the rest remains five or ten minutes
in the bowel.[74] Monti says as much as two pints can be injected into
the bowel of a nursing child--for older children twice this quantity.[Footnote 70: _Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.[Footnote 71: _New Views of the Process of Defecation_, Washington,

connected with a reservoir of water elevated above the patient.The
rectum is first distended with water, and the tube is gradually made to

descending colon.Thus the water may be made to distend the whole of
the colon to the caecum.The fluid remains from a few minutes to half
an hour.][Footnote 74: Henoch, _Diseases of Children_, Am.ed., New York, 1882,

this way with the most striking success.His object at first was to

the number of the discharges.And Ewald[76] has imitated Messemer's
method with results which are surprisingly good.of cold water, which was expelled by pressure on the abdomen;

treatment in a large number of cases in children.The question as to
the ability to force water thrown into the rectum through the sigmoid
flexure and distend the colon has been settled by the experiment of
Mosler in a case where there was a caecal fistula.Water injected into
the {698} rectum traversed the colon and escaped through the fistula in
two minutes.[77]

colitis the rules already given apply.{699}

CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic intestinal catarrh has many of the same causes as
the acute form; it is the expression of a large number of different
pathological states and complicates many general and local diseases.It is very common in children under two years of age, and is associated
with change in diet in weaning and with the irritability of all the
tissues during dentition.It is also a frequent disease in old persons,
being due to imperfect mastication, the weakness of digestion, portal
congestion, the gouty diathesis, and other causes.[1] Men have the
disease more frequently than women.Hereditary influence and
idiosyncrasy predispose to chronic catarrh of the bowel as to catarrh
of the bronchi.Bad hygiene, want of cleanliness with an unhealthy
condition of the skin, constant breathing of foul air due to want of
proper ventilation, animal decomposition, or overcrowding predisposes
to chronic diarrhoea.The chronic diarrhoeas among soldiers in
camps,[2] among the inmates of prisons, workhouses, and asylums, are
examples of these influences.Overwork, especially mental overwork with
anxiety, and privation of sleep act in the same direction.In the
chronic constitutional diseases and in many chronic diseases of organs
diarrhoea sooner or later appears, and very generally is the immediate
cause of death.In phthisis pulmonum, whether tubercular or not, simple
catarrh of the bowel is nearly always present.[Footnote 1: _La Diarrhee chez les Viellards_, Paris, Thesis, 1865, No.See also works of Durand-Fardel and Charcot and Loomis.][Footnote 2: According to the statistics prepared in 1871 by T. B. Hood
of the U.S.Pension Office, chronic diarrhoea was the disease for which
a pension was granted in 20 per cent.of all cases of disability from
disease and in 75 per cent.of all the diseases of the digestive system
(_Report of Commissioner of Pensions_, 1871).]During the course of chronic Bright's disease, more frequently in the
cirrhotic form, lesions are developed in the intestine which cause
obstinate diarrhoea.The discharge of urea into the intestine, and its
conversion into carbonate of ammonium, which acts as an irritant to the
mucous membrane, is the reason of the diarrhoea in this disease,
according to Luton and Treitz;[3] and in so far as the discharge
represents the escape of urea by the bowel, it may be regarded as
salutary.In gout, especially in old persons, periodical diarrhoea
gives relief.Chronic gouty subjects assert that they are not benefited
by colchicum until it has purged them.The {700} lithic-acid diathesis,
pyaemia, septicaemia, scurvy,[4] diabetes, leucocythaemia, Addison's
disease, and syphilis[5] have diarrhoea during some part of their
progress.The malarial cachexia is often attended with a diarrhoea
which quinia alone will relieve; this symptom may occur periodically or
be constant.[Footnote 3: A. Luton, _Des Series morbides, Affections uremiques de
l'Intestin_, Paris, Thesis, 1859, No.45; also, Treitz, "Ueber
uramische Darmaffectionen," _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, Bd.[Footnote 4: See testimony as to the influence of scurvy in promoting
diarrhoea (Woodward, _Med.History of the War_, Part 2,
Medical Volume, p.[Footnote 5: A. Trousseau, "Comments on a Case of Syphilitic Diarrhoea
cured by Mercury," _Clinique med._, Paris, 1868, t. iii.Disease of the liver, heart, or lungs, by retarding the circulation in
the portal system, causes venous stasis and catarrh in the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.The chief conditions which bring
this about are tumors compressing the mesenteric veins, cirrhosis of
the liver, tumors pressing on the ascending vena cava, valvular disease
of the right and left heart, fatty degeneration or dilatation of the
heart, cardiac debility from chronic exhausting diseases, fibroid
phthisis, chronic pneumonic phthisis, chronic pleurisy, and pulmonary
emphysema.An unsuitable diet may not set up an acute catarrh, but may slowly
induce changes of a chronic nature in the mucous membrane.This is the
case in infants fed upon artificial food instead of breast-milk, or
when the digestion is overtaxed after weaning.In adults food difficult
of digestion and over-eating bring about the same result.Alcohol,
spices, and condiments, if taken in excess, and the habitual use of
purgatives, lead to chronic inflammation of the intestine.Foreign bodies, such as fecal concretions, gall-stones, stones of
fruit, bones, coins, and pins, by remaining in contact with the mucous
membrane for a length of time, determine inflammation and
ulceration.[6]

[Footnote 6: Lothrop, "Case of a Child in whom seventeen plum-stones,
three cherry-stones, and seven small bones were impacted In the caecum
and ileum for a year.Inflammation, ulceration, and perforation of the
bowel resulted" (_Buffalo Med.Journ._, March, 1882, p.Neglect in the treatment of acute catarrh, the prolongation of an acute
attack, from its intensity and the incurability of the lesions,
establish chronic disease.All chronic lesions of the bowel are complicated with chronic catarrh,
as chronic tubercular ulcer, neoplasms in the wall, pressure of a tumor
from without, etc.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The alterations in the intestines in chronic
catarrh involve the walls to a much greater extent than in the acute
form.The intestinal tube is dilated, contracted, or irregularly dilated and
contracted.When the calibre is increased the walls are thinned.Hypertrophy and hardening of the tunics, chiefly of the muscular and
submucous tissue, are accompanied by a narrowing of the canal, and this
change, most common in the rectum and sigmoid flexure, sometimes
involves a very considerable extent of the colon.Lebert records the
case of a woman who had diarrhoea for six weeks; constipation and
vomiting with abdominal tenderness ensued.There was hypertrophy of all
the coats of the stomach and of the ascending colon and rectum.The
rectum was so narrowed by the thickening of its wall that a female
catheter could not be passed through it.[7] In chronic catarrh the
mucous membrane {701} of the colon and of the lower part of the ileum
is the seat of the most characteristic lesions.The colon was alone the
seat of disease in 9 out of 99 cases analyzed by Woodward; in the
remaining 90 the two were involved together.In these the lesions in
the colon (especially in the rectum and sigmoid flexure) were always
more advanced and more serious than in the small intestine.[Footnote 7: Lebert, _Path.247, 248; another case,
Laboulbene, _Anat.path._, Paris, 1879, p.Gastric catarrh may by extension become duodenal catarrh, and from the
duodenum the disease may extend into the common bile-duct and its
branches.The duodenitis and catarrh of the ducts may persist, and
become chronic after the stomach lesion is gone.The mucous lining of the intestine is changed in color, form,
thickness, consistence, and in the appearance of its glandular
structures.The shades of color in chronic inflammation are dark red,
livid, brown, drab, or slate-color, light blue, and greenish.Dark-red and gray spots are seen on a pale
and uniform red ground; grayish streaks and patches are mingled with
red or whitish areas, giving rise to a mottled or marbled
appearance.[8] In some cases red predominates, in others the
slate-color.[9] Dark-brown, almost black, patches are also seen.These
different tints depend upon the intensity and character of the
inflammation and the stage which it has reached.Diffused bright-red
discolorations belong to acute inflammation, and are rarely seen in the
chronic form.Acute hyperaemic patches appearing in the midst of a
slate- membrane indicate intercurrent acute attacks.Dark-red
streaks or spots are caused by extravasations.Brown and slate-
areas represent the changes in old extravasations or pigment-deposits
where inflammation or ulceration has existed.Where the inflammation is
progressing toward the destruction of tissue the membrane is
dark-purplish or black in color, mottled with patches of dull reddish
hue and minute spots of bright red.Black dots are seen in the small
and large intestine isolated or in close proximity.They are due to
minute specks of black pigment deposited in the apices of the villi, in
the centres of solitary glands, in rings around them, or in the glands
of a Peyer's patch.The juxtaposition of pinhead black points gives
rise to the shaven-beard appearance[10] of the mucous membrane.Dark
streaks or wavy lines of pigment are also seen.[11]

inflammation see the following illustrations in color: _Med.of the War_, Part 2, Medical Volume--plates facing pp.308, 518,

volume cited, facing p.In the ileum the mucous folds are obliterated or swollen and thickened.Obliteration of the folds occurs in connection with a dilated
intestine; when the intestine is contracted they are elevated,
tortuous, and close together.The villi are hypertrophied, looking
often like minute polypi.The mucous coat is usually thickened,
measuring from one-fifth to one-fourth of an inch.It is softened, and
more easily scraped off,[12] but quite {702} frequently there is
induration instead of softening.The solitary glands of the ileum are
hypertrophied and appear scattered over the mucous surface as small
rounded elevations.They are quite numerous or a few only may be seen.A ring of vascular injection usually surrounds each enlarged follicle.Peyer's patches may be unchanged or from swelling of the follicles are
more prominent than is normal, but relatively the enlargement of the
solitary glands is greater.In chronic catarrh the follicles acquire
greater size than in the acute form.The apices of the solitary glands
in the small intestine may be broken down, leaving small follicular
ulcers, with swollen rings around them formed of the undestroyed and
hypertrophied gland-structure.Here and there one or two of the
follicles in the Peyer's patch may have its centre indented by
ulceration.These changes are usually in the lower part of the ileum
near the caecum.[Footnote 12: The mucous membrane is often tumefied and softened in
cases where there are thickening and contraction of the intestine with
great reduction of its calibre (Elliot Coues, _Med.Rep._,
Philada., 1863, vol.In the colon the enlarged solitary glands are in greater number, and
are dotted about more closely in the descending colon and sigmoid
flexure.[13] When there is ulceration the large intestine has many more
ulcers than the ileum, and they are more numerous in the lower part of
the colon.They appear as sharply-punched openings, and give to the
mucous surface a honeycombed look; their diameter varies from one-tenth
to one-fourth of an inch.Large ulcers formed by the confluence of
smaller ones measure from one-fourth to one inch in diameter; they may
be so deep as to have the muscular tunic for their base, and quite
often the bottom of the ulcers is black.A ragged or uneven appearance
is given to the surface by the ulcers being close together.Such
extensive destruction sometimes takes place that no normal mucous
membrane seems to be left.Perforating ulcers are occasionally seen in
the large intestine or ileum.Perforation occurred in two of Woodward's
ninety-nine cases.Healing ulcers[14] are found by the side of others
which are growing.Healed follicular ulcers are known by a puckered,
stellated appearance[15] of the mucous membrane, which is pigmented and
of a slate-gray or marbled-brown color[16] if the process has been long
completed.Larger dense cicatrices, pigmented also, mark the site of
more extensive ulcerations.[Footnote 13: Illustration, _Kupfertafeln zu_ DR.LESSER _uber die
Entzundung und Verschwarung du Schleimhaut des Verdauungskanales_,

figs.[Footnote 15: Illustration, _Med.[Footnote 16: Illustration, Cruveilhier, _Anat.; also, J. Hope, _Illustrations of Morbid Anatomy_, figs.Besides follicular ulcers the mucous membrane is disorganized by ulcers
which have their origin in a loss of epithelium and superficial
erosion.In addition to the lesions already described, the inflamed and
ulcerated surface is sometimes covered with a pseudo-membranous layer
of greenish-yellow color.Chronic catarrh of the duodenum is the cause of dilatation of the
vessels and thickening of the coats.A varicose condition of the veins
may give rise to hemorrhage without ulceration.[17] The orifice of the
common bile-duct and the ducts for some distance are narrowed by
swelling of their lining membrane.[18] Ulcer of the upper part of the
duodenum {703} is found rarely in connection with external burns and
chronic Bright's disease.It is more common in men between thirty and
forty years of age.An embolized artery is the starting-point of the
lesion.The mucous layer, deprived of its nutrition in a limited area,
dies or is destroyed by the acid gastric juice; a round ulcer with
terraced edges is left, its base being the muscular or serous coat.Adhesions may form between the peritoneum near the ulcer and the liver,
gall-bladder, or pancreas, or an opening may take place posteriorly in
the right seventh intercostal space or into the peritoneal cavity.Cicatrization of the ulcer may lead to narrowing of the canal of the
bowel or of the pancreatic and common bile-ducts.[19]

[Footnote 17: G. Coulon, _Bull.[Footnote 18: Duodenitis was made much of by Broussais and his
followers, and a great deal has been written about it.(See Boudin,
Paris, Thesis, 1837, No.76, _Essai sur la Duodenite chronique_.)][Footnote 19: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, Amer.Suppuration in the wall of the duodenum is still rarer.One case only
is on record of pus being found in the intestinal wall.[20]

[Footnote 20: Picard, _Bull.xv., 1840-41,
p.See also microscopic view of suppuration in wall of duodenum,
Thierfelder, _Atlas d. path.Histologie_, 2 lief., Tab.Chronic proctitis or inflammation of the rectum may exist by itself.The mucous membrane is swollen, hyperaemic, and the walls may be
indurated and thickened so as to reduce the calibre of the tube.Superficial erosions or deep ulcers and perforation are due to the
retention of hard fecal matter in the distended pouches of the rectum.Inflammation in the tissue around the rectum (periproctitis) is excited
by inflammation of the wall without perforation; abscesses form and
burst externally or into the bowel, thus establishing fistulae.PATHOLOGICAL HISTOLOGY.--The essential primary feature of chronic
catarrh is the increase and persistence of cell-accumulation in the
reticular connective tissue of the mucous and submucous layer.After an
acute or subacute attack some time elapses before the large number of
cell-elements are disintegrated or absorbed.By remaining they offer a
constant invitation to causes of irritation, hence the necessity for
prolonged care in diet after acute attacks.Fresh causes--imprudence in
eating, etc.--induce additions to the number of cells, and the tissue
becomes overcharged with active elements of growth.Hypertrophy of
tissues results, the mucous and submucous tissues thicken, and the
glandular structures are stimulated to a condition of morbid activity.The glands of Lieberkuhn elongate, the number of acini increases, and
the contained cells multiply.Accidental closure of the gland-openings
from outside pressure or over-accumulation of the contents leads to
cyst-formations.The lymph-cells in the reticular tissue of the closed
follicles undergo rapid increase; the follicle is over-distended,
projects above the surface, bursts, and a small ulcerating cavity is
left.This is now enlarged by the breaking down of the remaining tissue
of the follicle, then of the submucosa.The overhanging roof of mucous
membrane, deprived of its nutrition, sloughs off at the edges and the
exposed ulcerated surface is increased.By the confluence of two or
more burrowing ulcers more extensive destruction of the mucous and
submucous layers is brought about.The large deepened ulcers have the
mucous layer for their base.Cicatrization of the ulcers takes place by
the formation of cicatricial tissue at their base; the excavation is
filled up partially, by contraction the edges are brought together, and
the tissue solidifies.No villi or epithelium covers these cicatrices.{704} There are rarer pathological changes.In catarrh of long duration
cysts are found, especially in the large intestine.They are about the
size of a small pea, projecting above the mucous surface.They have a
yellow or amber color, and contain a jelly-like yellow fluid which can
be pressed out.They originate in the distension of the dilating glands
of Lieberkuhn; according to Woodward, they find a favorable nidus for
their growth in the softening tissue of the solitary glands; hence the
cystic forms are seen occupying the interior of follicles undergoing
disintegration.[21] The presence of the glands of Lieberkuhn in the
interior of the closed follicles has been observed by other
pathologists, some of whom are unable to explain so remarkable a
lesion.[22] Around the edges or in the midst of healing ulcers in the
intestine granulation-like excrescences or polypoid growths are
observed as a rare lesion.These seem to be projections from
undestroyed islands of mucous membrane, being surrounded by the
ulcerated surface.The minute polypi originate in a process of growth
of the undestroyed mucous tissue.Cicatricial contractions around their
bases give them peculiar forms; they are club-shaped, simple, or
branched.This lesion has been described by Johann Wagner,[23] Carl
Rokitansky,[24] and J. J. Woodward[25] from original specimens.According to Woodward, the growths (pseudo-polypi he calls them) are
composed of a central portion of connective tissue continuous with the
submucous connective tissue of the intestine and a peripheral portion
of diseased mucous membrane.The central connective tissue was filled
with large and numerous cells, and the glands of Lieberkuhn in the
mucous covering were elongated and branched and showed evidences of an
active hyperplasia.[Footnote 21: J. J. Woodward, _op.[Footnote 22: A. Laboulbene, _Anat.path._, Paris, 1879, p.[Footnote 23: "Einige Formen von Darmgeschwuren; iii., die

but they were not connected with ulceration and cicatrization of
ulcers.Luschka[26] saw the mucous membrane from the ileo-caecal valve
to the end of the rectum covered with polypi, club-shaped, the size of
a hempseed or bean, and made up of glandular tubes simple or branched.Other cases have been described by Lebert, Heuriet, and others,[27] in
which polypi were distributed in the rectum, colon, caecum, or about
the ileo-caecal valve.This is the condition described by Virchow as
colitis polyposa.[Footnote 26: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.[Footnote 27: Heuriet, _Bull.xlviii.,

being normal or in a state of chronic catarrh.of the cases examined either in the large or small intestine.The
caecum is the most frequent seat; next in the order of frequency it is
seen in the ascending {705} colon, the lower part of the ileum, the
other parts of the colon, and is least common in the upper part of the
ileum.In children the lesion is more common in the small intestine
than in adults.The changes in the mucous membrane of the colon are a
diminution in its thickness and disappearance of the glands of
Lieberkuhn.The mucous layer is reduced to one-fifth of its normal
size, and no trace of the glands may be left; a layer of connective
tissue with imbedded round cells is all that remains.The surface of
the membrane is irregular and  with yellowish pigment.In the
ileum the villi are shrunken, with few cells; in some cases they
disappear altogether.The muscular tunic may share in the atrophy.[28]

membrane is met with in chronic catarrh.The small arteries of the
villi and submucous layer, the muscular and other tissues, are
infiltrated with a new material allied to fibrin.The membrane to the
eye is paler than normal.When iodine is applied, a characteristic red
staining of the infiltrated parts is noticed.This lesion is a cause of
diarrhoea and of hemorrhage,[29] from the greater permeability and
greater fragility of the arteries.It is also associated with
follicular ulceration, and is probably a cause of disintegration of the
mucous membrane.[30]

catarrh, few of which have any distinctive character.The peritoneum
shows signs of old or recent inflammation.The former is subacute or
chronic, and is recognized by the adhesions of opposed surfaces in a
limited area, frequently corresponding to the seat of intense
intestinal inflammation.Fatal perforations are delayed or prevented by
these adhesions.General peritonitis with soft lymph or sero-purulent
effusion is found with perforation.The mesenteric glands may be
enlarged.The liver is larger or sometimes smaller than normal, and its
tissue is softened and may be fatty.Abscess of the liver[31] is a very
rare result of chronic intestinal catarrh, with ulceration.The
gall-bladder is usually filled with bile.The spleen is small and firm
in texture; less commonly it is soft and friable.The kidneys are large and pale; the cortical substance is
relatively increased and the tubules contain granular epithelium.[Footnote 31: It occurred in 4 per cent.of Woodward's cases of chronic

double.It was found in 18 of the 99 cases of Woodward, and in 21 out
of H. A. Allen's 41 cases.Inflammation of the pleura is not
infrequent.The brain and its membranes may be congested, and fluid is
found in the subarachnoid space, in some instances in cases which have
had a sudden termination.The cornea is ulcerated, and the eye
destroyed by opening of the anterior chamber in a small proportion of
cases.The sloughing process begins in the lower part of the cornea and
in the sclerotic.SYMPTOMS.--When chronic intestinal catarrh succeeds the acute form, the
transition is marked by the disappearance of fever and an amelioration
of all the symptoms, with apparent recovery.The patient begins to go
about, but diarrhoea returns whenever there is any unusual fatigue or
excess in eating.In some cases there is no improvement in the
diarrhoea, but in the general symptoms only.When the malady is chronic
from the beginning, the onset is characterized by symptoms of
indigestion and occasional diarrhoea, which become more and more
pronounced according to the severity of the illness.Mild forms of catarrh have constipation, or diarrhoea alternates with a
normal or constipated state of the bowels.The form in which
constipation is continuous is associated with mechanical stasis from
liver and heart lesions and with the gouty and uric-acid diathesis.The
mucous membrane is in a state of passive hyperaemia, an excess of mucus
being the product of the inflammatory process.Mucus coats the lining
tunic, lessens its irritability, interferes with digestion and
absorption, and acts as a ferment, exciting decomposition in the food.The bowel is atonic and is distended with contained gas; there is great
feebleness of peristaltic contractions.Intestinal indigestion and constipation are therefore the symptoms of
this form.The signs of indigestion occur one to three hours after
eating, according to the location of the maximum of catarrh and the
time taken by the food to reach this point.They are a sense of fulness
or distress in the abdomen from gaseous distension, slight colicky
pains, and a rumbling of gas, which may be prolonged during several
hours after a meal.The constipation is indicated by the spontaneous
passage of dry masses or scybalae coated with layers of mucus which are
clear or cloudy, or the mucus may be intimately mixed with solid
matter.Pure mucus is also expelled without fecal matter.There may be
no stool without a purgative, and then softened matter with scybalae
and mucus is passed.Altered mucus in the form of membraniform shreds
or cylinders occasionally pass in the so-called membranous enteritis.The abdomen is full and not sensitive to pressure.The tongue is coated
and usually pale and flabby.In appearance the patient exhibits a
general want of tone; the skin is white or muddy, the muscles are soft,
and the expression indicates the depression of spirits, the lassitude,
and the inertia which he feels.Hemorrhoids are very likely to {707}
exist.Such a condition may last for months or years without much
change.Under proper treatment recovery may take place, but if entirely
neglected or improperly treated the disease inevitably becomes worse.In a second mild form there is no permanent disease, only an
impressionability of the mucous membrane of the bowel to causes which
induce hyperaemia and excessive secretion ending in diarrhoea.Exposure
to cold, fatigue, or slight indiscretions in diet may bring it on; even
an emotional cause may do it.The attacks last one or several days, and
may at times assume some gravity.This predisposition to diarrhoea
lasting through a lifetime is analogous to the tendency to inflammation
of the nasal and other mucous membranes.In severer and typical forms the symptoms point to permanent lesions.The tongue is smooth, shining, or glazed, sometimes with a central
brown streak, but it may be also pale and covered with a white coat.The appetite is diminished or lost, or it is capricious, craving
unsuitable food.If there is no gastric catarrh, the chief distress
does not come until some hours after eating, but the taking of food
sometimes excites pain and brings on an evacuation of the bowels
through reflex influence.There may be slight tympanites or a retracted abdomen.The imperfect
digestion of food and the fermentation of the intestinal contents
develop gas which keeps the abdomen distended and causes slight pains
and borborygmi.A feeling of
abdominal soreness is not unusual; it is increased by coughing,
sneezing, or any sudden movement.Sensibility to pressure is usually
wanting; when it exists it is found along the line of the colon in most
cases.The number of the stools
varies from one to eight in twenty-four hours; four is about the
average number.They occur usually in the early morning hours, from two
to six o'clock, but food may at any time bring on peristaltic
contraction, so that a motion after every meal is not uncommon.In
quantity there is much variability; two to four ounces of fluid matter
is the rule perhaps, but a very much larger amount than this is often
passed with each evacuation.As a rule, the larger the quantity of
fluid the more extensive is the catarrh and the more advanced are the
lesions.The matters passed are composed chiefly of fecal matter
varying in consistence from a solid or semi-solid mass to a watery
fluid.In the soft stool, like thickened gruel, the consistence is due
to the presence of mucus; in the thinner evacuation water is the chief
element.In color the dejecta are
brown, yellow, red, green, slate-color, or white.They may be 
dark by medicines, as iron or bismuth, or by blood.The presence of
blood gives a pinkish, bright-red, dark-brown, or black color,
depending upon the amount of blood and the changes it has undergone in
the bowel from a longer or shorter retention.Blood, when it comes from
the rectum, is in bright-red streaks or small coagula.When its source
is higher up, it is much altered, being dark and granular.Coffee-ground sediment in a fluid stool is blood from the upper part of
the intestine or stomach.The spreading of an ulcer may open a vessel
of some size, and a fatal hemorrhage follow.A yellow tint like that of
a child's movement may arise from a mixture of pus and fecal matter.Pus, as a milky or creamy fluid which may be {708} streaked with blood,
is a frequent appearance in disease of the rectum and sigmoid flexure.The odor of the stools is fecal, sour, or sickening from fermentation
or offensive from decomposition.In bad forms of chronic diarrhoea in
children the black watery stools have a most offensive odor.Mucus is the most constant ingredient of the diarrhoeal stool, and is
in itself a sufficient evidence of catarrh, as it is not seen in normal
stools except as a temporary phenomenon.It is present in flakes in
watery evacuations, giving a jelly-like character to the fluid if it is
in excess, or it is mixed with semi-solid feces.Pure mucus may be
passed, if the catarrh is low down, in clear, glairy, or opaque masses.The frog's-egg or boiled-sago particles supposed by Niemeyer and others
to point to follicular ulceration, and by Traube to be the swallowed
bronchial secretion, are said by Virchow to be partly-digested starch,
and also by Nothnagel to be of vegetable nature.[33] The stools may
contain small yellow or brownish masses which are mucoid in nature,
being yellow from bile-staining.Pavement epithelial cells are found in
the coating of mucus around a hard fecal lump.Cylindrical epithelium
is passed uncolored or stained with bile.These cells are separated,
and are deformed and shrunken, with a granular protoplasm and
indistinct nucleus.Round cells in the form
of mucus-corpuscles or giant-cells are mixed with shreds of mucus or
float in the thin stools.Crystals of triple phosphate, of neutral
phosphate, oxalate of lime, and other lime salts, and of cholesterin,
are also seen.[Footnote 33: _Virchow's Archiv_, v. S.329; Nothnagel, "Zur Klinik der
Darmkrankheiten," _Zeitschrift fur klin.Med._, iii., 1881, p.Micrococci and bacteria have no pathological importance; they are seen
in different diseases and in health.Unaltered food may be expelled (lientery) by rapid peristaltic
movements.But the microscope will detect what cannot be seen by the
eye--unaltered starch-granules, filaments of meat-fibre, or fat in
drops or in needle-shaped or feathery crystals.The nervous system is disturbed after a certain time.There is languor,
with depression of spirits, mental weariness, and inaptitude for work
of any kind.The patient is querulous, morose; his sleep is restless,
but sometimes profound until disturbed by the demand to empty the
bowel.Melancholia is attributed to this as to other diseases of the
abdomen, but their influence in producing insanity is doubtful.[34]

[Footnote 34: Griesinger, _Mental Path.ed., New
York, 1882, pp.No decided symptoms are exhibited in the respiratory and circulatory
systems.Even slight exertion will cause shortness of breath and
increased frequency or palpitation of the heart.This irritability of
the heart is a marked feature of the disease.[35]

[Footnote 35: DaCosta found that of 200 cases of irritable heart, 61
were in patients who had suffered from or still had diarrhoea (_Am.The appearance of the urine is normal; it may be abundant, with
phosphatic deposit, or it is scanty and high-.In bad cases
albumen and casts have been found.[36]

[Footnote 36: Alonzo Clark, "Proc.The symptom indicative of atrophy of the mucous membrane is believed by
Nothnagel to be the persistent passage of one soft, unformed stool
daily.Mucus and fat, which diminish the consistence of the stool, are
{709} excluded by microscopical examination.One stool daily shows that
there is no exaggerated peristalsis which hurries the food along so
rapidly that water cannot be absorbed.[37]

[Footnote 37: Nothnagel, "Zur Klinik der Darmkrankheiten," _Zeitschrift
fur klin.Med._, iv., 1882, p.PROGRESS AND TERMINATION.--As the disease advances it is marked by
progressive emaciation and debility.The skin gradually acquires great
pallor, indicating profound anaemia.An exacerbation of the disease will in a few days cause the cheeks to
grow hollow, the eyes to appear sunken with dark rings around them.In
all cases of long duration the progress is intermittent; frequent
relapses occur from which the patient may rally and regain a moderate
degree of flesh.Recovery may take place in weeks or months--eighteen
months is the average duration[38]--but in most instances a tendency to
a recurrence of the diarrhoea from cold, fatigue, or indiscretions in
diet will continue throughout life.An incomplete recovery may take
place by the cessation of the diarrhoea and formation of a stricture
from the healing of an intestinal ulcer.In the worst cases there is no
rule as to the rapidity or regularity of the march of the disease.[Footnote 38: C. H. Ralfe, Seamen's Hospital, London: see Aitken's
_Handbook of Treatment_, New York, 1882, p.When the advance is toward a fatal issue the emaciation progresses
until it becomes extreme; nothing but skin and bone are left.The
cuticle is hard and dry, pale or brownish in color.The muscular
strength is so reduced that the patient is unable to move from bed.The nervous depression and moroseness
assumes a more marked character.Among the soldiers during the Civil
War who had undergone great privations with insufficient or improper
diet the mental phenomena were those of dementia.[39] In them the
disease was modified also by the symptoms of scurvy and malarial
poisoning.[Footnote 39: W. Kempler, "Entero-Colitis," _Am.Fever is seen in the late stages; it is nocturnal at first, and later
assumes the features of hectic.The pulse grows more frequent and
thready; aphthous deposits appear on the inside of the mouth and
pharynx.Toward the end the discharges may become more frequent and
very abundant; they are more fluid, lighter  or black, with
floating particles of blood and mucus.There may be a loss of odor or
they may have a cadaveric smell.Death takes place in a few weeks or after years of alternate suffering
and relief.The immediate causes of death are exhaustion, marasmus from
starvation, collapse from perforation of an intestinal ulcer and
consecutive peritonitis, syncope from sudden exertion, pneumonia, or
acute pulmonary congestion, pleurisy, or subarachnoid effusion in the
brain, with coma and convulsions.COMPLICATIONS.--General dropsy results from the hydraemia and languid
circulation of the late period of the disease.Other causes of this
symptom are coincident diseases of the liver, kidney, or the malarial
cachexia.Oedema of one extremity follows a thrombus in the crural
vein.Chronic bronchitis and pulmonary phthisis are sometimes met with.Acute pneumonia[40] and acute pulmonary congestion are occasional {710}
causes of death.Peritonitis may occur with and without perforation.The latter variety begins as a local inflammation of subacute or
chronic nature, and spreads slowly until it becomes general.Extensive
adhesions and abundant accumulations of serous, sero-purulent, or
purulent fluid in the abdominal cavity result.[Footnote 40: Pneumonia (8 double and 12 single) occurred in 20 out of
41 fatal cases reported by Harrison Allen, _Tr.Philada._,
1867, vol.The causal conditions which have been enumerated may be considered as
complications.They are tuberculosis, Bright's disease, cirrhosis of
the liver, abdominal tumors, scurvy, tubercular and other neoplasms in
the wall of the intestine; attacks of intercurrent, intermittent, or
remittent fever arise from the malarial influence to which the
intestinal catarrh is due.These fevers and rheumatism and
pseudo-rheumatism are complications in soldiers from the exposure to
malarial influences and to cold and dampness.[41]

[Footnote 41: Woodward, _op.Ulceration of the cornea, escape of the aqueous humor, and collapse of
the eye were observed in quite a number of cases occurring among
soldiers.[42]

[Footnote 42: Elliot Coues, _Med.Reporter_, Philada., 1863,
vol.207, and H. Allen, _Tr.SEQUELAE.--The alteration of structure from long-standing inflammation
leaves the mucous membrane prone to recurrence of inflammation.Chronic
intestinal indigestion and permanent malnutrition come from the same
cause.The glandular and lymphatic structures of the intestine and the
mesenteric glands are so changed by disease that they imperfectly
perform their function.Tabes mesenterica is the ultimate phase of this
change.Constipation succeeds chronic diarrhoea, and is due to atony of
the muscular wall from long-continued distension, and probably from
degeneration of the muscular structure.A more serious cause of
constipation, and sometimes of intestinal obstruction, is found in
stenosis of the bowel from the healing of the ulcers of long-standing
chronic catarrh.Stricture is more common in the colon, sigmoid
flexure, and rectum.How frequently such a result follows the
cicatrization of intestinal ulcers is not definitely known.Woodward
concludes from a careful search of books and pathological museums that
stenosis from this cause is very rare.[43] Syphilis is the most common
cause of ulcer.Local or general peritonitis leads to the formation of
adhesions or fibrous bands uniting neighboring links of intestine.By
the contracting of these narrowing of the intestinal canal may result.Paralysis, hemiplegia, paraplegia, etc.have been found to follow upon
diarrhoea of long standing.[44]

[Footnote 43: Woodward, _op.[Footnote 44: Potain, "Paresie des Membres inferieurs ayant succede a
un Catarrhe gastro-intestinal," _Rev.Med.-Chir._, Paris,
1880, xlvii.562; "Paralysis spinale secondaire a une Diarrhee
chronique," _Journ.Prat._, Paris, 1880, 3, S. ii.DIAGNOSIS.--The mild form of chronic catarrh of the intestines
associated with constipation has been confounded with hepatic
disorders, and the obscure symptoms attending it have been attributed
to excess or diminution of bile, and medicines to regulate the liver
have been given accordingly.In the absence of lesions in the liver, in
cases where symptoms such as have been described have preceded death,
the opinion is not justified that disease of this organ has existed.On
the contrary, alteration in the mucous membrane is almost always found,
which points to the true nature of the disease.The diagnosis is based
upon the accompanying {711} gastric catarrh and upon the symptoms of
intestinal indigestion and malnutrition.Greater sensibility to
pressure over the right hypochondrium and along the line of the colon,
pain one to two hours after eating, with distension of the abdomen, the
passage of well-formed and somewhat indurated feces mixed or coated
with mucus, are symptoms peculiar to these mild forms.The tendency to diarrhoea from cold, indigestible food, etc.which
marks the second form of mild catarrh is easily recognized.The characteristic symptom of the severe form is the persistent
diarrhoea.Paroxysmal pains, tympanites and rumbling of gas, tenderness
on pressure over the colon, the alternate periods of improvement and
relapse, with the constitutional signs of impaired nutrition and
progressive anaemia and debility, point out the nature and the seat of
the lesion with sufficient clearness.It is futile to attempt to
distinguish chronic intestinal diarrhoea from chronic dysentery.The
lesions of the two conditions are essentially the same; it depends upon
the fancy as to which name is given to the lesions described here under
the title chronic intestinal catarrh.A greater amount of blood and
mucus in the stool with tenesmus would more properly be called
dysenteric, but the same case may present at one time diarrhoeal, at
another dysenteric, symptoms.Primary must be distinguished from secondary diarrhoea.Therefore the
liver, heart, and lungs must be examined to discover diseases which
might cause portal congestion.Any constitutional malady may be a cause
and an explanation: tuberculosis or pulmonary phthisis stands first in
its influence; next, chronic Bright's disease, septicaemia, scurvy,
syphilis, and gout are attended by intercurrent diarrhoea.If all
general disease can be excluded and the morbid process be located in
the intestine alone, its cause may be known by studying the habits,
occupation, and diet of the patient.Foreign bodies--hardened feces,
gall-stones, fruit-stones, etc.--are possible causes which the history
of the case may point to.Having located the disease in the intestine and decided upon its
primary or secondary nature, it remains to determine more precisely
(_a_) the locality of the lesion, and (_b_) the stage of the
inflammatory process.(_a_) In what part of the intestinal canal is the disease located?It
must be remembered that in typical and fatal cases the large intestine
is the home par excellence of the lesions of chronic catarrh, and that
the lower part of the ileum is often associated in the morbid
processes, but limited areas of the small or large intestine are
affected in mild forms which yield readily to treatment.Icterus, clay- stools, and bile in the urine show that the
catarrh is in the duodenum and involves the opening of the common
bile-duct.The absence of diarrhoea, with flatulence and colics, limits
the area of inflammation to the duodenum.Symptoms of duodenal
indigestion accompany this form of catarrh; the failure of bile to
neutralize the acid chyme impairs the effect of the pancreatic
secretion.Fats are not digested and there is fatty diarrhoea.To this
may be added tenderness in the right hypochondrium, and pain and
oppression in the epigastrium and to the right one hour after eating.There may be wasting and hypochondriasis.{712} The lower part of the duodenum below the opening of the
bile-duct, the jejunum, and the ileum can be taken together as forming
the small intestine.Chronic catarrh of the small intestine is attended
with pain about the umbilicus, which comes on immediately or in one
hour after taking food.Tympanitic distension gives a full, rounded
prominence to the abdomen, which is more central than lateral, and
greater below the umbilicus than above it.It is accompanied by a sense
of oppression, which is greater after eating.Inability to digest food
consisting largely of starch or sugar, as well as tardiness in the
digestion of all foods, with resulting loss of flesh, are signs of
intestinal indigestion.There may be no diarrhoea; if there is,
important help to diagnosis can be gained by examining the stools.They
contain undigested or partly-altered meat-fibre and starch-granules,
discoverable only by the microscope.The discharges are soft and pulpy
from an intimate admixture of mucus.To the naked eye no mucus is
visible, but a thin layer under the microscope shows clear islets of
pure mucus, or mucus may only be detected by the adhesion of the
covering-glass to the slide.Bile-stained epithelium and globules of
stained mucus are seen in the liquid stools from catarrh of the small
intestine and of the ascending colon.There is the characteristic
reaction and play of color on testing for bile-pigment.These are
evidences that the stool with the bile has been hurried along the ileum
and colon, and expelled before the transformation in the coloring
matter has had time to take place.[45]

[Footnote 45: "II.Abtheilung, Diagnostische Bemerkungen zur
Localisation der Catarrhe," _Zeitschrift fur klinische Medicin_,
Berlin, 1882, iv.In catarrh of the large intestine there is sensitiveness to pressure
along the line of the colon; the distension of the abdomen is not
uniform, depending upon the prominence of the transverse or descending
colon.The pains are more severe and precede the stools, which are more
frequent and larger than in catarrh of the ileum.The discharges are
pulpy or watery.Globules of mucus are visible to the naked eye, and
mucus is intimately mixed with fecal matter.If the lower half of the colon is chiefly the seat of the disease, pure
mucus coats the more solid stool and is in its substance.With catarrh
limited to the descending colon scybalae are imbedded in mucus.From
the sigmoid flexure and rectum larger masses of mucus, without fecal
matter or with it, are expelled.Pure lumps of mucus, mixed or stained
with red blood and without fecal matter, indicate catarrh of the
rectum--proctitis.(_b_) The stage of the process of inflammation is diagnosed by the
condition of the patient, the course of the disease, and the character
of the stools.As long as there is a pulpy fecal diarrhoea, with no
blood, pus, or fragments of tissue and no marked emaciation or fever,
and with a tendency to improvement under favorable conditions, there is
every reason to believe that there is no ulceration.In follicular ulceration the course of the disease is essentially
chronic, and is marked by periods of improvement under careful
treatment, with exacerbations and relapses from slight causes of
irritation.There is progressive emaciation and debility, with fever of
hectic character, which is worse in the later stages.The movements are frequent and liquid, and are without
odor or fetid.They {713} contain mucus, glassy-gray or green,
pus-cells imbedded in masses of mucus, blood in small amount, but
sometimes abundant, and shreds of the tissue of the mucous membrane.The higher the ulcer the less marked is the diarrhoea.The lower its
situation the greater is the frequency of the stools and the more
liable are they to be accompanied by tenesmus and to contain blood and
pus.Toward the last, ulceration is accompanied by rapid emaciation,
fever, sweats, a feeble circulation, a dry tongue, great thirst, and
oedema of the feet and ankles.Death takes place by gradual exhaustion,
more rarely from perforation and peritonitis or from intestinal
hemorrhage.[46]

[Footnote 46: Nothnagel, "Die Symptomatologie der Darmgeschwure,"
_Klinische Vortrage Volkmann_, No.Duodenal ulcer is with difficulty recognized during life.[47] The
following are the symptoms which have preceded death from this lesion:
Profuse hemorrhage from the bowel, vomiting of food as well as blood,
icterus, dysphagia, hiccough, oppression in the epigastrium after
eating, attacks of cardialgia with tenderness on pressure in the right
hypochondrium, and sudden death with symptoms of collapse.If these
symptoms follow an extensive burn of the skin, they are easily referred
to a duodenal ulcer.[Footnote 47: W. L. Loomis, "Perforating Ulcer of Duodenum and Sudden
Death."For two years the patient had suffered with dyspepsia and
epigastric pain after eating, was gouty, and had lost flesh.Autopsy:
atheroma of arteries, beginning cirrhosis of kidneys, walls of stomach
thickened, perforated ulcer one inch below pylorus (_Med.Record New
York_, 1879, vol.188; also _Boston City Hospital Report_, 1882,
p.Tuberculous ulcers are distinguished from follicular ulcers by the
history of hereditary predisposition, the existence of pulmonary
tuberculosis, higher fever, and more rapid emaciation and debility.A cancerous ulcer may be the cause of bloody stools; it is usually
within reach of the finger in the rectum; the mass exercises pressure
upon the prostate, and at times occludes the bowel, causing
obstruction.The cachexia and rapid decline are not seen in catarrhal
ulceration.PROGNOSIS.--Chronic catarrh of the intestine is most fatal in children.Among infants artificially fed, when the illness develops and continues
during hot weather, the mortality is very great.Recovery in the young
is rendered less probable if chronic diarrhoea is associated with
rickets, scrofula, or tuberculosis.If the catarrh in adults is a complication of some previously existing
constitutional disease, as Bright's disease or scurvy, or is connected
with lesions of the liver, spleen, heart, or lungs, there is less hope
of cure.In old persons this disease has a special gravity.The longer the disease has lasted before treatment is begun, and the
longer it continues without being influenced by treatment, the more
unfavorable will be the prognosis.Discouraging symptoms are an
uninterrupted loss of flesh and strength, lientery, hectic fever,
relapses notwithstanding care in diet, and the signs of
ulceration--blood, pus, and tissue-shreds in the stools, with an odor
of decomposition.Favorable promises may be based upon a hearty willingness of the
patient to submit to the strictest regimen and to subordinate his life
to the plans of treatment, the absence of other diseases, early
improvement in his general condition and local symptoms under rest and
diet.A {714} complete cure cannot be assumed to exist unless the
patient has passed one or more years without a relapse.TREATMENT.--As chronic intestinal catarrh is a complication of so many
conditions, the prevention of it becomes a matter of great importance
and of very general application.All rules for preserving
health--temperance in eating and drinking, bathing, exercise, good
ventilation, the avoidance of overwork, both mental and physical--are
so many means for escaping an intestinal catarrh which may present
itself as an indigestion with constipation or as a diarrhoea.The special liability of infants and children, and to a less extent of
very old persons, and the greater dangers they run, call for the most
careful selection of appropriate diet at these periods of life.Where there is hereditary predisposition, idiosyncrasy, chronic
diseases of organs, or constitutional diseases, an easily-digested
dietary should be supplemented by precautions against chilling of the
surface by the wearing of flannel underclothing and woollen socks.The etiology of each case may at once suggest a line of treatment.Among the causes which point to appropriate measures are--the continued
presence in the bowel of indigestible or undigested food, constant
exposure to cold or to changes of temperature, chronic cardiac disease
and portal congestion from any cause, chronic cachexiae, as syphilis,
malaria, tuberculosis, or Bright's disease, the crowding together of
individuals in prisons, asylums, etc.The mildest form of intestinal catarrh characterized by intestinal
indigestion and constipation or by the passage of fecal matter more or
less solid, mixed or coated with mucus, is best treated by a diet such
as is advised for intestinal indigestion, bathing with friction,
outdoor life, exercise on horseback or by walking, pleasurable
occupations, and travel.Iron if there is anaemia, and strychnia if
there is a sluggish capillary circulation, with cold hands and feet,
are available and useful in many cases.Massage and the Swedish
movement treatment find useful application in feeble men and in women
who are not strong enough for outdoor exercise.To aid the digestion
the liquor pancreaticus as advised by Roberts, a teaspoonful one hour
and a half to two hours after each meal, with ten to twenty grains of
the bicarbonate of sodium, is, theoretically at least, to be warmly
recommended.The Rockbridge alum water, a small glass three times daily
between meals, has astringency enough for the hyperaemic membrane and
is of good service without increasing constipation.Purgatives should be avoided as much as possible.An enema of cool
water, not more than a tumblerful, taken each morning after breakfast
if persevered in, may do all that is needed in this direction.If it
fails to empty the bowel completely, a larger enema of warm water--one
pint--holding in solution sulphate of zinc or alum in the strength of
one grain to three or four ounces, can be thrown high up with a rubber
tube once daily.This acts upon the mucous surface, constringes mildly
the congested vessels, and when expelled brings away the retained fecal
matter.These astringent rectal injections offer promise of cure in
many obstinate cases where the colon is chiefly the seat of disease.Belladonna is advised for cases of this kind in combination with
strychnia for the constipation.Bedford mineral water, Hunyadi water, or other salines and the less
active vegetable {715} cathartics, can be given alternately.Ipecacuanha has had quite a reputation in combination with purgatives
in intestinal catarrh.Aloin pills empty the bowel without much
attendant irritation.The form of catarrh which shows itself in a tendency to diarrhoea
from indiscretions in diet or from exposure to cold must receive
prophylactic treatment.Especially in this form is it important to
improve the activity of the skin by bathing and friction, and to lead a
temperate life in all things, regulating the diet according to the
rules already stated.Fowler's
solution of arsenic (one drop before each meal, Ringer), the
potassio-tartrate or the tincture of the chloride of iron, dilute
sulphuric acid, nitro-muriatic or hydrochloric acid, are efficient in
improving digestive activity or in opposing the anaemia which is nearly
always present.Quinia is indicated in malarial anaemia with a
disposition to loose bowels.Quassia or other vegetable bitters can be
given if the appetite is languid; the bitters are, as a rule, of little
benefit, and may do harm if diarrhoea exists.Strychnia with quassia or
columbo stimulates the appetite and the gastric digestion.When
intercurrent attacks of diarrhoea come on with coated tongue,
flatulence, distress about the umbilicus after eating, bismuth given on
an empty stomach in full doses is serviceable.Small doses of morphia
or of opium in some form can be added to the bismuth if there is much
pain or when the stools are frequent.In this and in other forms of intestinal catarrh mineral waters are
profitably employed.They are best taken at their sources; and here, as
in the case of sea-bathing, the benefit is largely due to the change of
air and scene and to the more simple mode of life.Any of the
watering-places where alkaline-saline waters or ferruginous waters are
found may be of benefit.A trip to Europe and a stay at Carlsbad will
break up many an obstinate case of chronic abdominal disorder; but
other beneficial waters in Europe are Tarosp, Rohitsch, Marienbad,
Kissengen, and Plombieres.In this country the comfort and conveniences of the summer hotels and
climate are as much to be considered as the chemical composition of the
waters.For milder forms of catarrh with constipation a season at
Saratoga, with a life of temperance there, is a wise procedure.Bedford
Springs, Pa., offer the same advantages in part, but the waters are
best suited to catarrh with constipation.Many of the Virginia springs
benefit health-seekers who do not place too much reliance upon the
virtues of the waters, and who trust to the value of pure air,
exercise, diversion, and rest.All plans of treatment for the more severe form of catarrh with
chronic diarrhoea (follicular enteritis) must be based upon a knowledge
of the lesions.Bearing in mind the alterations in the mucous and
submucous tissues, it is clear that no treatment can be successful
which is not carried out with the most careful attention to details,
and which is not continued for some time after all the symptoms of the
disease have ceased.The complete resolution of hypertrophied glandular
tissue, the scattering of cell-accumulations, and the healing of ulcers
can only be secured in this way.It is best to present the whole case
before the patient, so as to enlist in the task his intelligent
co-operation.Directions for the guidance of cases of this kind must include every
{716} detail of the patient's life.The question of residence is of
importance to begin with.A cool and dry climate is better than a wet
and warm one, and where other means fail change of climate is sometimes
the only cure.A sea-voyage, a residence in a mountain-region, will
oftentimes promptly and effectually cure an obstinate diarrhoea.House-drainage and ventilation should be examined into and improved.The occupation may have developed the disease; in overwork may lie the
origin and the cause of its continuance.Rest from work is therefore in
some instances the one thing needed.In all cases the energies and the
brain should not be overtaxed.The bath to keep the skin active can be
combined with friction.The hot bath, as hot as can be borne, is the
best.It is a stimulant, not a depressant, as is the tepid bath, and it
is safer than the cold bath.The cold sitz bath or the application of cold compresses diminishes
abdominal plethora, and is wisely advised in strong persons who are not
depressed or chilled by external cold.Sea-bathing is another
hydro-therapeutic measure which is of unquestioned advantage in all
forms of intestinal catarrh.Permanent baths have been found very serviceable in many chronic
diseases, and there are many reasons for advising them in obstinate
diarrhoeas.There can be no better means for bringing to bear a strong
and continued influence upon the intestinal mucous membrane.The
patient should be kept in the warm bath for one, two, or three weeks,
according to his strength and the effect upon the disease.Systematic
hot bathing under the direction of a physician at Richfield, Sharon,
the Hot Springs of Virginia or Arkansas, is an invaluable aid.Rest in the recumbent position for cases where the symptoms indicate
marked tissue-alteration is very often the most important part of the
treatment.Rest and diet are alone necessary to cure many cases, and
without these combined means relief is often impossible.The rest
should be absolute, the patient using a bed-pan and lying down all the
time.The contraindications for this method are a slight diarrhoea
which yields to other treatment, and loss of strength and appetite from
the deprivation of air and exercise.If rest is not advisable, or does no good after a fair trial of two to
four weeks, outdoor life in fair weather by driving or walking slowly
can be suggested.A long drive will bring back a diarrhoea which has
taken many weeks to relieve.The rules for diet must be clearly given and strictly enforced.An
exclusive milk diet should have a trial in every case.Skimmed milk can
be taken in larger quantities and with less repulsion, and is therefore
to be preferred.The exclusive milk diet can be varied with buttermilk,
koumiss, or wine-whey; and fruit-juices, as orange-juice, lime-juice,
or tamarind-water, please the patient without doing harm.In the case
of adults as well as children the milk is made more digestible by
diluting it with barley- or rice-water or by adding transformed
farinaceous food to milk in the form of Mellin's food and other foods
of this class.Animal broths, as chicken-soup and beef-tea, are well digested if
properly made and given in small quantities.Raw meat scraped, beef or
mutton rare and thoroughly masticated, the breast of poultry, game,
broiled fish, raw oysters, raw or very slightly boiled eggs, or
sweetbread, are foods from which selection can be made to add variety
to the dietary.{717} Saccharine, starchy, and fatty foods are to be
given as little as possible.Vegetables may be added to the list as the
condition improves.Rice and fine hominy (grits) are to be thought of
first, as being easily digested and nourishing.Good wine in moderation
is not hurtful; the red wines diluted with water are the best, but good
port, tokay, and whiskey well diluted find application in particular
cases.Whatever food be given, it should be taken in the quantities and at
hours prescribed by the physician, who by careful inspection of the
stools judges of the necessity of changes in his regulations and of the
success of his treatment.The further treatment of chronic diarrhoea has for its object by the
aid of drugs to change the anatomical state of the mucous membrane.Manifestly, the choice depends upon the state of this tissue.In the
earlier stages the increased vascularity and hypersecretion call for
mild astringents or for medicines which are believed empirically to
oppose these conditions.When drugs can be dispensed with, it is better
to do so; they should always be made subordinate to the careful regimen
already described.Bismuth in large doses (ten to thirty grains) is a safe and efficacious
remedy in this stage.Nitrate of silver in pill form (one-sixth to
one-fourth of a grain) has the endorsement of Wm.Pepper and many other
practitioners.It should be continued for two or three weeks at least,
but it may be given in small doses during several months, with
intermissions, without danger of silver staining.[48]

[Footnote 48: A case is recorded of silver staining of the skin after
four weeks' administration (Woodward, _op.A routine administration of any drug or class of drugs is
reprehensible, and from the numerous remedies which are advocated in
chronic diarrhoea selection can be made for trial in the course of
intractable cases.The list would include sulphate of copper
(one-fourth to one-half a grain), the liquid preparations of iron
(liquor ferri nitratis, tinct.ferri chloridi), dilute nitric and
sulphuric acids, gallic acid and other vegetable astringents, oxide or
sulphate of zinc, alum, precipitated phosphate of calcium, salicin,
corrosive sublimate (1/100 gr.every hour), the Indian bael-fruit, etc.No remedy should be abandoned until it has been continuously given for
one or more weeks.alum water is markedly astringent, is not
unpleasant, and may be used as a substitute for water with advantage.In fact, there is no better way of introducing in quantity a mild
astringent into the intestine than by the drinking of this water.Cold-water rectal irrigation has a sedative and astringent influence,
and when properly used is of great advantage to both children and
adults.[49] The patient should be placed in the proper position, and
the water made to enter the rectum as high up as possible.The number
of stools lessens almost immediately after this treatment, peristalsis
being inhibited thereby.[Footnote 49: A long rectal rubber tube, such as advised by
Surgeon-General Wales, U.S.N., serves this purpose well.]To the water used in irrigation astringents may be added in small
doses.Sulphate of zinc, sugar of lead, or alum may be given in this
way in the strength of one grain to four or six ounces of water.This
{718} method of treatment promises more and is more rational than the
internal administration of drugs.Opium and its preparations should be avoided except to control frequent
or watery discharges or to relieve pain, but it is not often that this
is called for if wiser measures are first employed.Any of the remedies
spoken of may be given in the form of suppositories with greater
advantage often than by the mouth.In that more severe class of cases called follicular ulceration, in
which the follicles are known to be ulcerated from a prolongation of
the illness, the obstinacy of the diarrhoea, the character of the
discharges, and the effect upon the general health, other measures are
to be adopted.The diet should be most strictly regulated and the
digestive power of the patient carefully studied.Cod-liver oil is
added with advantage to other foods if there is a lack of nutrition.Aids to gastric digestion are called for.The intestinal lesion is to be reached through the stomach or the
rectum.Nitrate of silver in small doses is more especially applicable,
and is to be preferred to all other drugs in this stage.It is to be
given in small doses and for several weeks.Turpentine and copaiba have something in their favor in ulceration.Ergot has been suggested, and where there is much hemorrhage from the
bowel may be prescribed.Irrigations with solutions of nitrate of silver seem to be a direct and
certain remedy in cases where ulceration has existed for a long time.Two and a half to three pints of distilled water, holding in solution
five grains of nitrate of silver, should be thrown up the rectum as
high as possible with a rubber tube; the effort should be made to
secure immediate exit to the fluid.This procedure is to be repeated
after the bowels are moved--once every day or every other day if the
rectum becomes irritable.[50]

CHOLERA MORBUS.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Cholera nostras, Sporadic cholera, European or English
cholera, Spasmodic cholera, Cholera biliosa, Passio cholerica,
Cholerhagia, Trousse-galant, Die Gallenruhr, Brechruhr.DEFINITION.--An affection of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane
characterized by violent abdominal pain, nausea, and sudden, violent,
and incessant vomiting, and by purging of a watery fluid containing
little albumen and bile; attended with spasms of the muscles of the
abdomen and extremities, a pinched and sunken countenance, pallor,
cyanosis, and coldness of the surface of the body; a feeble and rapid
pulse, oppressed respiration, and great restlessness; dryness of the
tongue, great thirst, and diminished or suppressed urinary secretion
and a state approaching collapse, which may rarely prove fatal, but is,
as a rule, followed by reaction.HISTORY.--The term cholera has been in use since the time of
Hippocrates, but he confounded with it every disease which seemed to
him to come from acridity or corruption of humors, as colics and
meteorism with constipation.[1] He well described cholera morbus in
saying that "it is a disease which appears in summer, due to imprudence
in eating, at the same time as intermittent fever."[2] If Celsus be
correct in deriving the name from [Greek: chole] "bile," and [Greek:
reo] "I flow," it is more applicable to the disease now under
consideration than to the Asiatic disease, as it is the bile which is
absent in the colorless rice-water discharges of Asiatic cholera.Trallian and Ruysch, however, ascribe it to [Greek: cholera] the
rain-gutter of a house.les Maladies aigues_, 19, ii.[Footnote 2: _Epidemies_, lib.In the Old Testament mention is made of a disease resembling cholera
morbus.[3] Its true pathogeny was known to Galen, and it was accurately
described by Celsus,[4] and Aretaeus[5] mentions the nature of the
discharges and its frequency among young people and children.des Maladies epidemiques_, Paris, 1825.]The first mention of epidemics was in the sixteenth century.Various
epidemics in 1695, 1717, and 1718 in Germany were probably cholera
morbus.Forestus[6] reports seven observations from 1559 to 1565 of
attacks due to indigestible food or drastic medicines.F. Hoffman,[7]
{720} J. Frank,[8] and L. Riviere speak of the benignity of the disease
as contrasting it with its apparently dangerous symptoms.[Footnote 6: _Opera Omnia_, Rothomagi, 1633, "De stomachi affectibus,"
lib.[Footnote 7: _Medicina rationalis systemica_, t. iv.[Footnote 8: _Praxeos medicae universae praecepta_, Leipzig, 1826, p.Sydenham's[9] description of the epidemics in England in 1669-72 is the
earliest account of the disease in modern literature, and it was he who
gave it the name cholera morbus.NATURE.--There prevails at the present time a great diversity of
opinion in regard to its nature; the want of uniformity in the
appearances presented by post-mortem examinations may in some measure
account for this.The present state of our knowledge, derived both from
pathological anatomy and a study of the symptoms, will not warrant a
positive opinion in regard to it.Niemeyer,[10] in common with most German and some French authors,
considers cholera morbus to be a variety of gastro-intestinal catarrh.Leube[11] thinks it a variety of gastric catarrh with simultaneous
inflammation of the intestines and running a peculiar course.It is
certainly not identical with the specific Asiatic disease, although in
some cases the symptoms and morbid anatomy are exactly similar, and any
differentiation is impossible.By some it is believed that cholera
morbus is due to surviving germs implanted by previous epidemics of
Asiatic cholera.[Footnote 11: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, New York, 1876, vol.The slight changes found in some fatal cases would lead to the belief
that the effect of the exciting cause is something more than a
mechanical irritation of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.The sudden onset, rapid development of symptoms, and dangerous collapse
justify the theory that there must be some previous change in the
individual or some peculiar result of food-decomposition.The nervous
system may be so enfeebled by prolonged heat that an irritant quickly
destroys its equilibrium and brings about vaso-motor paralysis of the
intestinal vessels and abundant serum transudation.Or the irritation
may be specific, depending upon the development of poison germs in food
which has been subjected to heat influences.There is a close
relationship between cholera morbus and cholera infantum in their
etiology, symptoms, and pathology.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--The disease is more common in the
tropics, but is not confined to any climate.In temperate latitudes it
is more likely to occur in July and August, when the variation of
temperature between day and night is great, although the other months
of summer and autumn are not entirely exempt.It is said to be more
frequent and fatal in Southern Europe than in the northern and
temperate climates.In periods immediately preceding and following
epidemics of Asiatic cholera many persons are attacked, although there
is great liability to errors in diagnosis at these times.It occurs more frequently in youth and adolescence than in advanced
life, and males seem to be more liable to attacks than females, but
difference in occupation may assist in this predisposition.Persons
endowed with an extreme sensibility of the nervous system and who are
subject to frequent attacks of intestinal catarrh are much more liable
to the disease.The exhaustion of the nervous system by heat, which is
the {721} probable explanation of the phenomena of cholera infantum,
has no doubt much to do with the development of cholera morbus.Mental
anxiety or overwork in summer increases this nerve-exhaustion and
renders the termini of nerves and the centres very susceptible to
peculiar irritation.Exciting Causes.--It is probable that the cause of most attacks is a
septic material generated in the fermentation and decomposition of
food.This poison acts as an irritant upon the gastric and intestinal
nerves and gives rise to excessive peristaltic movements and vomiting.Hence the quality of the food is an element of more importance in the
causation than the mere quantity ingested; and herein may reside the
chief difference between cholera morbus and Asiatic cholera, the latter
being due to a specific, imported, or acclimated poison which
invariably produces the same specific form in those exposed to its
action.[12] Unripe fruits, partially cooked or decaying meats and
vegetables, shellfish and fish some time from the water, may produce
the disease in those predisposed to it.The intemperate use of
ice-water and other cold drinks after a full meal or when the body is
exhausted by heat and fatigue, exposure to showers at the close of a
hot day, or passing from a heated room into damp cellars and
outbuildings, are frequent exciting causes.[Footnote 12: "Bias the pugilist, naturally a great eater, had a sudden
choleraic attack after having eaten of succulent food" (Hippocrates,
lib.At times there exists a certain condition of inactivity of the
digestive organs when the gastric juice is not secreted in sufficient
quantity, and perfectly sound food may undergo fermentation and set up
an attack.The offensive exhalation from a filthy alley which had been recently
cleaned was the exciting cause of a fatal epidemic in a London
school,[13] and Levier recounts an epidemic caused by the
drinking-water during the winter in Berne.[14]

[Footnote 13: _Lond.f. Heilk._, iii., 1864, p.Nervous disturbance from other diseases may act as a cause.Leube
reports a case of intermittent fever which was followed by an annual
attack of cholera morbus preceded by febrile symptoms.[15]

[Footnote 15: Leube, _Ziemssen_, 1876, vol.Malaria, sewer-gas, and sudden and powerful mental emotions are
credited with the causation of some attacks.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--In a few cases an examination of the body has
revealed no phenomena sufficient to account for the symptoms, even when
they have been the most severe during life.In these cases either the
inflammation has not passed the first stage of development and the
resulting hyperaemia has disappeared after death, or the irritation of
the gastro-intestinal nerves has been sufficiently intense to cause
death before the alimentary tract has undergone any consequent
structural change.Usually, however, there are evidences of a general gastro-intestinal
catarrh: the mucous membrane is congested throughout and denuded of
epithelium.The solitary glands are enlarged and Peyer's patches
swollen and prominent.The blood is thickened and dark in color, and
the serous membranes dry, sticky, and covered with desquamated
epithelium.Indeed, the appearances may be identical with those
observed in true Asiatic {722} cholera.The kidneys are congested,
sometimes enlarged, and the tubules devoid of epithelium.In protracted
cases the general muscular system shows a beginning of granular
degeneration.In no case, however, can a positive diagnosis between Asiatic cholera
and cholera morbus be made from post-mortem appearances.SYMPTOMS.--The attack is usually sudden in its onset, but in some cases
is preceded by nausea, thirst, loss of appetite, and slight general
distress for some hours, or it may come on in the course of some
gastro-intestinal disturbance.Frequently it is developed during sleep,
particularly after midnight, the patient being aroused by a feeling of
pressure at the pit of the stomach, which is followed by nausea and
violent and incessant vomiting with intense pain, the contents of the
stomach being ejected with great force.The matters first vomited consist mainly of the food last eaten, little
altered or mixed with gastric mucus and tinged with bile.In a certain
proportion of cases the amount of bile is increased, although it is
difficult to judge of the relative proportion by the color and taste of
the vomited liquid.The general belief that the liver is implicated and
the bile secreted in morbid quantity rests upon conjecture alone, and
has no solid basis.After a time only yellow, brown, or greenish mucus,
with more or less bile, is ejected, and in protracted cases hiccough is
most distressing.Following the vomiting or at the same time with it purging comes on,
and it is usually preceded by borborygmi.In rare cases there is no
vomiting, but only intense pain in the bowels and copious alvine
discharges from the beginning to the end of the attack.The stools in
the beginning are normal in color, but soon become pulpy or semi-fluid.As they increase in quantity they become watery, consisting of
blood-serum with mucus, cast-off epithelium and pus-cells, and are
nearly odorless, and sometimes resemble very closely the discharges of
Asiatic cholera, but almost invariably retain the yellow or green color
of the bile.Colorless rice-water discharges are observed in undoubted
cases of cholera morbus outside of any epidemic influence.The
discharges are acrid and irritating, and the neighboring parts become
red and excoriated.At the same time there is intense burning or tearing pain in the
abdomen, generally centring at the umbilicus, great thirst and painful
contractions of the muscles of the abdomen and extremities,
particularly in the calves of the legs, and of the flexors of the
thighs, forearms, fingers, and toes.In the beginning there may be
tympanites, but this soon disappears, and the abdomen becomes retracted
and the muscles drawn up into knots.The cramps usually come on after
each act of vomiting and purging, but they may appear spontaneously.Abdominal tenderness is either wanting or slight.As the transudation
continues the thirst becomes intense, the tongue cold, dry, and coated,
and the tissues shrivelled from loss of water.The skin is cold,
clammy, or covered with a viscid sweat, and the surface of the body is
cyanosed, violet, or in the extremities it may have a marbled
appearance.The nose is pointed, the eyes dark and sunken, and there is
a general appearance of collapse.The mind may be clear throughout, but in protracted cases there is
great nervous prostration.The patient becomes dull and lethargic,
passing into stupor after great restlessness and jactitation.The voice
is faint {723} or whispering, the breath cold, and the respiration
sighing.The pulse in the beginning may be depressed, but soon becomes
rapid and often imperceptible, and there is great praecordial anxiety.As the blood becomes thickened the urine is highly, small in
quantity, and it may be suppressed.An examination shows traces of
albumen, casts and desquamated epithelium, and a decrease in the amount
of urea and salts.In the last stages there may be a slight rise in
temperature, but it has no definite course and it is usually absent.In
collapse the temperature of the surface of the body sinks below normal,
but the temperature of the interior may rise as high as 101 degrees or
102 degrees F., as shown by the thermometer in the rectum or
vagina.[16]

[Footnote 16: _London Hosp.PROGRESS AND TERMINATION.--But, fortunately, the course of the disease
tends toward recovery in the large majority of cases.The discharges
gradually decrease in quantity, the intervals are longer, the
appearance becomes more natural, and a profuse perspiration is followed
by a refreshing sleep.The surface becomes warmer, the pulse slower and
more full, and the skin regains its normal color.If the case has been a severe one or if it occurs in a person much
enfeebled by disease, it pursues a different course.The discharges
become almost uninterrupted, and at last are passed involuntarily.The
cramps are almost continuous or are convulsive, the pulse grows rapidly
weaker and is finally lost, coma succeeds stupor, and death follows in
collapse.The duration of the disease varies from a few hours to two or three
days; death has occurred within twelve hours.Recovery is generally complete after a few hours; and this rapid return
to the normal condition shows that there have been no textural change
of organs.Sometimes great emaciation, irritability of the stomach, and
slight diarrhoea persist for a few days, or symptoms of a general
gastro-enteritis may supervene.DIAGNOSIS.--In making the diagnosis of cholera morbus it is necessary
to carefully differentiate it from epidemic cholera and the effects
produced by irritant poisons, such as the metallic salts, poisonous
fungi, etc.Occurring during an epidemic of Asiatic cholera, it is not possible to
make a diagnosis, as the symptoms of cholera morbus and of mild cases
of the Asiatic disease are identical.From severe cases it is to be
distinguished by the absence of antecedent diarrhoea, by the presence
of bile in the vomited matters, and by the color and fecal odor of the
stools.The nausea and abdominal pain are more marked, while the
dyspnoea, cyanosis, and shrunken condition of the skin are less marked.The mortality of cholera morbus is slight, whilst about one-half of
those attacked with epidemic cholera die.In irritant poisoning the vomiting follows quickly after the ingestion
of a meal or poisonous matter; it continues for some time before
purging begins, and is out of all proportion to the diarrhoea.The
vomited matters contain blood and mucus and are never serous in
character.Corrosive poisons may cause redness, charring, or ulceration
of the mouth and throat and a burning sensation in the stomach.The
pain over the stomach is more constant and severe, particularly in the
intervals of {724} vomiting, and there may be abdominal tenderness and
bloody discharges.The expression is more anxious and the pulse rapid
and weak.Elaterium and tartar emetic will bring on vomiting and purging which
resemble the symptoms of cholera morbus.Choleriform attacks due to
uraemia simulate cholera morbus.The distinction is to be made by the
previous history--pain and purging being relatively less prominent in
uraemia--by the presence of albumen and casts in the urine, and by the
early tendency to coma.Acute peritonitis, attended by copious vomiting and purging, has been
mistaken for cholera morbus, and the true nature of the affection only
revealed by the autopsy.PROGNOSIS.--As a rule, cholera morbus occurring in persons otherwise
healthy ends favorably in a few hours.Cases of secondary fever, with
gastro-intestinal catarrh, may prolong the attack from a few days to
two weeks.Should treatment have no effect in lessening the vomiting
and purging, and should the evidences of heart-failure become apparent,
a fatal result may be feared.Death has occurred within twelve hours,
and the mortality is 3 per cent.[17]

[Footnote 17: Bartholow, _Pract.Med._, New York, 1880, p.Cases occurring in the course of other diseases possess a special
gravity.TREATMENT.--During the summer months, and particularly in August and
September, when the hot days are succeeded by cool nights, iced drinks
should be used in moderate quantities; the diet should be light,
nutritious, and easy of digestion.Unripe fruits and articles of food
liable to fermentative changes should not be indulged in.Exposure to the night air, particularly after a full meal, should be
especially avoided, and the clothing ought to be so arranged that
additions may be made as night approaches.Slight attacks of
indigestion should not be neglected, and any irregularity of the bowels
must receive immediate attention.The period when the physician is called upon to prescribe for an attack
of cholera morbus is usually when the stomach has been emptied of food
and the patient is vomiting incessantly, purging, and writhing in pain.If vomiting has not occurred and violent epigastric pain is the only
symptom, the stomach should be emptied by an emetic of hot water and
mustard repeated until the overcharged organ is completely emptied.Partially-digested food in a state of acid fermentation will thus be
got rid of, and the sufferings may be immediately but not wholly
relieved.If spontaneous vomiting has expelled the food, and the matters vomited
are green and watery, while pain and frequent stools with muscular
cramps, heart feebleness, and threatening collapse are the symptoms
presented, the remedy par excellence is a hypodermic injection of
sulphate of morphia (gr.1/8 to 1/3) with sulphate of atropia (gr.If one dose is not followed by decided mitigation of
suffering, the injection is to be repeated in a half hour or an hour,
not giving above one grain of morphia in divided doses.At the same
time, and while waiting for the full effect of the narcotic, efforts
can be directed to giving ease to the muscular spasms and pain by brisk
friction with stimulating lotions or by mustard poultices to the
abdomen and extremities.The morphia will be the best and quickest
stimulant which can be used; it will therefore be useless in most cases
to administer brandy, camphor, chloroform, {725} or other remedies of
that sort.Waiting and giving nothing by the mouth is the wiser course.In twenty minutes to half an hour the most perfect bien etre succeeds
to the previous agony and exhaustion.In some cases the vomiting,
purging, and cramps cease more gradually, and six hours will pass
before the patient is at ease.The intense thirst is best treated by
the giving of cracked ice sparingly at first, more freely later.Nothing substitutes morphia hypodermically with success, but in some
instances or when the stomach is not very irritable it may be necessary
to give medicine by the mouth.In this case chloroform (xv to xxx
drops), chlorodyne (x to xx drops), or spirits of camphor (v to x
drops) every quarter or half hour in ice-water may be directed.Chloroform and camphor can be combined with the deodorized tincture of
opium in ten- to twenty-drop doses.Time is wasted in expecting relief
from remedies which are inevitably rejected as soon as taken; it is
only when the stomach is very tolerant that it is judicious to begin
with them.The weakness of the heart's action must be combated by brandy or
whiskey, given by the mouth with pounded ice or administered
hypodermically.A considerable quantity of brandy or diluted alcohol
may be introduced by repeated injections beneath the skin.Iced
champagne may be tried with good effect.H. C. Wood quotes Hall[18] as
recommending hypodermic injections of chloral in the cold stage of
cholera.Five to eight grains in twenty minims of distilled water can
be thus given, and repeated at intervals of fifteen to twenty minutes
until some effect is perceived.[Footnote 18: _Lancet_, May 2, 1874.]If vomiting persists after the other symptoms--pain and muscular
spasms--are relieved, it is due to the intense gastric hyperaemia;
giving nothing which is not necessary is the wiser plan.Carbolic acid,
hydrocyanic acid, bismuth, bromide of sodium, or small doses of calomel
are remedies which meet the indication.Food should be withheld as long
as possible; then iced barley-water, followed by milk and lime-water in
very small quantities at short intervals, will test the power of the
stomach to retain and digest food.{726}

INTESTINAL AFFECTIONS OF CHILDREN IN HOT WEATHER.BY J. LEWIS SMITH, M.D.The summer affections of the intestines in children are chiefly of a
diarrhoeal character.Diarrhoeal attacks, as is well known, are much
more frequent and severe in the summer months than in other portions of
the year.Moreover, the diarrhoea of the summer season occurs chiefly
among children under the age of two and a half years, and is much more
common and fatal in the cities than in the country.In the large cities
this malady has heretofore been the annually-recurring scourge of
infancy, but of late years its prevalence has been in some degree
diminished and its severity controlled by the establishment of health
boards and the enforcement of sanitary regulations.Still, it remains
an important disease in all our cities, and one that largely increases
the aggregate mortality.The truth of this statement is shown by the
statistics of deaths taken at random from the mortuary records of any
large city.Thus, in New York City during 1882 the deaths from
diarrhoea reported to the Health Board, tabulated in months, were as
follows:

        Jan.Under
  five   34   32   50   50   72   231  1533  817   362  195   68   35
  years.Over
  five   14   15   14   20   15    19   131  149    84   55   31   24
  years.Therefore, in 1882--and the statistics of other years correspond in
this particular--it is seen that nine times as many deaths of children
under the age of five years occurred from diarrhoea during the five
months from June 1st to October 31st as in the remaining seven months
of the year.It is also seen, in corroboration of the statement that
diarrhoea due to hot weather is chiefly a disease of infancy and early
childhood, that during these same five months, which embrace the summer
season, the number of deaths from diarrhoea under the age of five years
was seven and a half times greater than the number over that age.These
statistics agree with the general experience of physicians in city
practice.The summer diarrhoea would indeed be comparatively
unimportant were its death-rate as low in the first five years of life
as subsequently.The following statistics show how great a destruction of life this
malady causes even under the surveillance of an energetic health board;
and before this board was established it was much greater, as I had
abundant opportunities to observe.The last annual report of the New
York Board of Health was made in 1875, since which time weekly
bulletins have been {727} issued.The deaths from diarrhoea at all ages
in the three last years in which annual reports were issued were as
follows:

              1873.January       94     43     46
  February      84     34     52
  March         97     40     58
  April        114     47     45
  May           95     61     89
  June         220    144    157
  July        1514   1205   1387
  August       967   1007   1012
  September    424    587    608
  October      213    255    185
  November      87    105     57
  December      53     56     50

Thus, in these three years the aggregate deaths from diarrhoea during
the months from June to October inclusive, in which months the summer
diarrhoea prevails, were 9885, while in the remaining seven months the
number was only 1407.How large a proportion of these deaths in the
warm season occurred in children we may infer from remarks made by the
Health Board in regard to another year.In their annual report for 1870
the board state: "The mortality from the diarrhoeal affections amounted
to 2789, or 33 per cent.of the total deaths; and of these deaths 95
per cent.occurred in children less than five years old, 92 per cent.in children less than two years old, and 67 per cent.Every year the reports of the Health Board furnish
similar statistics, but enough have been given to show how great a
sacrifice of life the summer complaint produces annually in this city.What we observe in New York in reference to this disease is true also,
to a greater or less extent, in other cities of this country and
Europe, so far as we have reports.Not in every city is there the same
proportionate mortality from this cause as in New York, but the
frequency of the summer diarrhoea and the mortality which attends it
render it an important disease in, I believe, most cities of both
continents.In country towns, whether in villages or farm-houses, this
disease is comparatively unimportant, inasmuch as few cases occur in
them, and the few that do occur are of mild type, and consequently much
less fatal than in the cities.The comparative immunity of the rural districts has an important
relation, as we will see, to the hygienic management of these cases.ETIOLOGY.--In the causation of this disease two distinct factors are
recognized--the one atmospheric, the other dietetic.The prevalence and severity of the summer diarrhoea correspond closely
with the degree of atmospheric heat, as may be inferred from the
foregoing statistics.In New York this disease begins in the month of
May--earlier in some years than in others--in a few scattered cases,
commonly of a mild type.Cases become more and more numerous and severe
as the weather grows warmer until July and August, when the diarrhoea
attains its maximum prevalence and severity.In these two months it is
by far the most frequent and fatal of all the diseases in cities.In
the middle of September new patients begin to be less common, and in
the latter part of this month and subsequently new cases do not occur,
unless under unusual circumstances which favor the development of this
malady.In New York a considerable number of deaths {728} of infants
occur from the diarrhoea in October.October is not a hot month in our
latitude--its average temperature is lower than that of May--and yet
the mortality from this disease is considerably larger in the former
than in the latter month.This fact, which seems to show that the
prevalence of the summer diarrhoea does not correspond with the degree
of atmospheric heat, is readily explained.The mortality in October,
and indeed in the latter part of September, is not that of new cases,
but is mainly of infants, as I have observed every year, who contract
the disease in July or August or earlier, and linger in a state of
emaciation and increasing weakness till they finally succumb, some even
in cool weather.The fact is therefore undisputed, and is universally admitted, that the
summer season, stated in a general way, is the cause of this
annually-recurring diarrhoeal epidemic, but it is not so easy to
determine what are the exact causative conditions or agents which the
summer weather brings into activity.That atmospheric heat does not in
itself cause the diarrhoea is evident from the fact that in the rural
districts there is the same intensity of heat as in the cities, and yet
the summer complaint does not occur.The cause must be looked for in
that state of the atmosphere engendered by heat where unsanitary
conditions exist, as in large cities.Moreover, observations show that
the noxious effluvia with which the air becomes polluted under such
circumstances constitute or contain the morbific agent.Thus, in one of
the institutions of this city a few years since, on May 10, which
happened to be an unusually warm day for this month, an offensive odor
was noticed in the wards, which was traced to a large manure-heap that
was being upturned in an adjacent garden.On this day four young
children were severely attacked by diarrhoea, and one died.Many other
examples might be cited showing how the foul air of the city during the
hot months, when animal and vegetable decomposition is most active,
causes diarrhoea.Several years since, while serving as sanitary
inspector for the Citizens' Association in one of the city districts,
my attention was particularly called to one of the streets, in which a
house-to-house visitation disclosed the fact that nearly every infant
between two avenues had the diarrhoea, and usually in a severe form,
not a few dying.This street was compactly built with wooden
tenement-houses on each side, and contained a dense population, mainly
foreign, poor, ignorant, and filthy in their habits.It had no sewer,
and the refuse of the kitchens and bed-chambers was thrown into the
street, where it accumulated in heaps.Water trickled down over the
sidewalks from the houses into the gutters or was thrown out as slops,
so that it kept up a constant moisture of the refuse matter which
covered the street, and promoted the decay of the animal and vegetable
substances which it contained.The air in the domicils and street under
such conditions of impurity was necessarily foul in the extreme, and
stifling during the hot days and nights of July and August; and it was
evidently the important factor in producing the numerous and severe
diarrhoeal cases which were in these domicils.In another locality, occupied by tripe-dealers and a low class of
butchers who carried on fat- and bone-boiling at night, the air was so
foul after dark that the peculiar impurity which tainted it could be
distinctly noticed in the mouth for a considerable time after a night
visit.In the street where {729} these nuisances existed and in
adjacent streets the summer diarrhoea was very prevalent and
destructive to human life.Murchison states that twenty out of
twenty-five boys were affected with purging and vomiting from inhaling
the effluvia from the contents of an old drain near their school-room.Physicians are familiar with a similar fact showing this purgative
effect of impure air--that the atmosphere of a dissecting-room often
causes diarrhoea in those otherwise healthy.The exact nature of the deleterious agent or agents in foul air which
cause the diarrhoea, whether they be gases or organisms, has not been
fully determined; but at a recent meeting of the Berliner Med.Gesellschaft, A. Baginsky made a report on the bacilli of cholera
infantum, which he states he has found both in the dejections and in
the intestinal mucous membrane in the bodies of those who have perished
with this disease.In the stools, along with numerous other organisms,
Baginsky states that he found masses of zoogloea, and the same
organisms he detected on the surface of the small intestines, and could
trace their wanderings as far as the submucous tissue.[1] But it is
evidently very difficult to determine whether such organisms sustain a
causative relation to diarrhoea or spring into existence in consequence
of the foul secretions and decomposing fecal matters which are present.The impurities in the air of a large city are very numerous.Among
those of a gaseous nature are sulphurous acid, sulphuric acid,
sulphuretted hydrogen; various gases of the carbon group, as carbonic
acid, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide; gases of the nitrogen
group, as the acetate, sulphide, and carbonate of ammonium, nitrous and
nitric acids; and at times compounds of phosphorus and chlorine
(Parkes).A theory deserving consideration is that certain gaseous
impurities found in the air form purgative combinations.D. F. Lincoln,
in his interesting paper on the atmosphere in the _Cyclopaedia of
Medicine_, writes in regard to sulphuretted hydrogen: "When in the air,
freely exposed to the contact of oxygen, it becomes sulphuric acid.Sulphide of ammonium in the same circumstances becomes a sulphate,
which, encountering common salt (chloride of sodium), produces sulphate
of sodium and chloride of ammonium.The sulphates form a characteristic
ingredient of the air in manufacturing districts."The sulphates, we
know, are for the most part purgatives, but whether they or other
chemical agents exist in the respired air in sufficient quantity to
disturb the action of the intestines, even where atmospheric impurities
are most abundant, is problematical and uncertain.Again, the solid impurities in the air of a large city are very
numerous, as any one may observe by viewing a sunbeam in a darkened
room, which is made visible by the numerous particles floating in it.These particles consist largely of organic matter, which sometimes has
been carried a long distance by the wind.The remarkable statement has
been made that in the air of Berlin organic forms have been found of
African production.Ehrenberg discovered fragments of insects of
various kinds--rhizopods, tardigrades, polygastrica, etc.--which,
existing in considerable quantity and inhaled in hot weather, when
decomposition and fermentation are most active, may be deleterious to
the system.Monads, bacteria, vibriones, amorphous dust containing
spores which {730} retain their vitality for months, are among the
substances found in the air of cities.The well-known hazy appearance
of the atmosphere resting over a large city like New York when viewed
from a distance is due to the gaseous and solid impurities with which
the air is so abundantly supplied--impurities which assume importance
in pathological studies, since minute organisms are now believed to
cause so many diseases the etiology of which has heretofore been
obscure.With our present knowledge we must be content with the general
statement that impure air is one of the two important factors which
cause summer diarrhoea, without being able to state positively which of
the elements in the air are most instrumental in causing this result.But the theory is plausible that minute organisms rather than chemical
products are the chief cause.Henoch of Berlin, writing upon this
subject, calls attention to the disease known as intestinal mycosis,
its prominent symptom being a severe diarrhoea produced by eating
diseased meat containing a fungus.He believes that "a portion of the
fungus not destroyed by the gastric juice settles upon different parts
of the intestine, and there produces its effects;" and he adds, "At
present, however, we can regard the mykotic theory of cholera infantum
only as a very probable hypothesis.There is no doubt that high
atmospheric temperature increases the tendency to fermentation
dyspepsias which is present in imperfectly-nourished children at all
seasons, and causes them to appear not only epidemically, but also in
an extremely acute form which is not frequent under ordinary
circumstances.This would lead to the conclusion that, in addition to
the heat, infectious germs are present, which, being developed in great
masses by the former, enter the stomach with the food."The fungus
theory of the causative relation of atmospheric heat to the diarrhoea
of the summer season as thus explained by Henoch commands the readier
assent since it comports with the well-known facts relating to the
etiology of the summer complaint.This disease, as we have seen, is
most prevalent and fatal under precisely those conditions of dense
population, filthy domicils and streets, and atmospheric heat which are
favorable for the development of low organisms.In those portions of our cities which are occupied by the poor, more
than anywhere else, those conditions prevail which render the
atmosphere deleterious.One accustomed to the pure air of the country
would scarcely believe how stifling and poisonous the atmosphere
becomes during the hot summer days and close summer nights in and
around the domicils in the poor quarters of the city.Among the causes
of this foul air may be mentioned too dense a population, the occupancy
of small rooms by large families, rigid economy and ceaseless endeavor
to make ends meet, so that in the absorbing interest sanitary
requirements are sadly neglected.Adults of such families, and children
of both sexes as soon as they are old enough, engage in laborious and
often filthy occupations.Many of them seldom bathe, and they often
wear for days the same undergarments, foul with perspiration and dirt.The intemperate, vicious, and indolent, who always abound in the
quarters of the city poor, are notoriously filthy in their habits and
add to the insalubrity by their presence.Children old enough to be in
the streets and adults away at their occupations escape to a great
extent the evil effects of impure air, but the infantile population
always suffer severely.Every physician who has witnessed the summer diarrhoea of infants is
{731} aware of the fact that the mode of feeding has much to do with
its occurrence.A large proportion of those who each summer fall
victims to it would doubtless escape if the feeding were exactly
proper.In New York City facts like the following are of common
occurrence in the practice of all physicians: Infants under the age of
eight months, if bottle-fed, nearly always contract diarrhoea, and
usually of an obstinate character, during the summer months.The
younger the infant, the less able is it to digest any other food than
breast-milk, and the more liable is it therefore to suffer from
diarrhoea if bottle-fed.In the institutions nearly every bottle-fed
infant under the age of four or even six months dies in the hot months
with symptoms of indigestion and intestinal catarrh, while the
wet-nursed of the same ages remain well.Sudden weaning, the sudden
substitution of cow's milk or any artificially-prepared food in place
of breast-milk in hot weather, almost always produces diarrhoea, often
of a severe and fatal nature.Feeding an infant in the hot months with
indigestible and improper food, as fruits with seeds or the ordinary
table-food prepared in such a way that it overtaxes the digestive
function of the infant, causes diarrhoea, and not infrequently that
severe form of it which will be described under the term cholera
infantum.Many obstinate cases of the summer complaint begin to improve
under change of diet, as by the substitution of one kind of milk for
another or the return of the infant to the breast after it has been
temporarily withdrawn from it.It is a common remark in the families of
the city poor that the second summer is the period of greatest danger
to infants.This increased liability of infants to contract diarrhoea
in the second summer is due to the fact that most infants in their
second year are table-fed, while in the first year they are wet-nursed.Such facts, with which all physicians are familiar, show how important
the diet is as a factor in causing the summer complaint.Occasionally, from continued ill-health, the milk of the mother or
wet-nurse does not agree with the nursling.Examined with the
microscope, it is found to contain colostrum.Under such circumstances
if a healthy wet-nurse be employed the diarrhoea ceases.It is very
important that any woman furnishing breast-milk to an infant should
lead a quiet and regular life, with regular meals and sleep.19, 1882, R. B. Gilbert relates
striking cases in which venereal excesses on the part of wet-nurses
were immediately followed by fatal diarrhoea in the infants which they
suckled.One not a resident would scarcely be able to appreciate the difficulty
which is experienced in a large city in obtaining proper diet for young
children, especially those of such an age that they require milk as the
basis of their food.Milk from cows stabled in the city or having a
limited pasturage near the city, and fed upon a mixture of hay with
garden and distillery products, the latter often largely predominating,
is unsuitable.It is deficient in nutritive properties, prone to
fermentation, and from microscopical and chemical examinations which
have been made it appears that it often contains deleterious
ingredients.If milk be obtained from distant farms where pasturage is
fresh and abundant--and in New York City this is the usual source of
the supply--considerable time elapses before it is served to customers,
so that, particularly in the hot months of July and August, it
frequently has begun to undergo {732} lactic-acid fermentation when the
infants receive it.That dispensed to families in the morning is the
milking of the previous morning and evening.The common result of the
use of this milk in midsummer by infants under the age of ten months is
more or less diarrhoea.The ill-success of feeding with cow's milk has led to the preparation
of various kinds of food which the shops contain, but no dietetic
preparation has yet appeared which agrees so well with the digestive
function of the infant as breast-milk, and is at the same time
sufficiently nutritive.In New York City improper diet, unaided by the conditions which hot
weather produces, is a common cause of diarrhoea in young infants, for
we meet with this diarrhoea in infants who are bottle-fed at all
seasons; but when the atmospheric conditions of hot weather and the use
of food unsuitable for the age of the infant are both present and
operative, this diarrhoea so increases in frequency and severity that
it is proper to designate it the summer epidemic of the cities.Several
years since, before the New York Foundling Asylum was established, the
foundlings of New York, more than a thousand annually, were taken to
the almshouse on Blackwell's Island and consigned to the care of the
pauper-women, who were mostly old, infirm, and filthy in their habits
and apparel.Their beds, in which the foundlings were also placed
alongside of them, were seldom clean, not properly aired and washed,
and under the beds were various garments and utensils which these
pauper-women had brought with them as their sole property from their
miserable abodes in the city.With such surroundings, the air which
these infants breathed day and night manifestly contained poisonous
emanations; while their diet was equally improper, for it was prepared
by these women from such milk and farinaceous food as were furnished
the almshouse.When assigned to duty in the almshouse, this service
being at that time a branch of Charity Hospital, I was informed that
all the foundlings died before the age of two months; one only was
pointed out as a curiosity which had been an exception to the rule.The
disease of which they perished was diarrhoea, and this malady in the
summer months was especially severe and rapidly fatal.The unpleasant
experiences in this institution furnished additional evidence, were any
wanting, that foul air and improper diet are the two important factors
in causing the summer diarrhoea of infants.Since that beneficial
charity, the New York Foundling Asylum, in East Sixty-eighth street,
came into existence, providing pure air and, for a considerable
proportion of the foundlings, breast-milk, many of these waifs have
been rescued from death.I have already stated that this disease occurs, with an occasional
exception, under the age of two and a half years.The following table
embraces all the cases that came to one of the city dispensaries during
my service between the months of May and October, inclusive:

       Age.5 months or under         58
   5 months to 12 months    212
  12 months to 18 months    174
  18 months to 24 months     93
  24 months to 36 months     36
                            ---
        Total               573

After the third year the liability to the summer complaint so rapidly
{733} diminishes that comparatively few are affected by it.It is seen
from the above statistics that by far the largest number of cases occur
during the period of first dentition; hence the prevalent opinion among
families that dentition causes the diarrhoea.It is the common belief
among the poor of New York that diarrhoea occurring during dentition is
conservative, and should not be checked.They believe that an infant
cutting its teeth suffers less, and may be saved from serious illness,
if it have frequent stools.Every summer I see infants reduced to a
state of imminent danger through the continuance of diarrhoea during
several weeks, nothing having been done to check it in consequence of
this absurd belief.The progressive loss of flesh and strength and
wasting of the features do not excite alarm, under the blinding
influence of this theory, till the diarrhoea has continued so long and
become so severe that it is with difficulty controlled, and the patient
is in a state of real danger when the physician is first summoned.The
following statistics, which comprise cases occurring during my service
in one of the city dispensaries, show the preponderance of cases during
the age when dental evolution is occurring:

                                              Cases.No teeth and no marked turgescence of gums    47
  Cutting incisors                             106
     "    anterior molars                       41
     "    canines                               40
     "    last molars                           20
  All the teeth cut                             28
                                               ---
        Total                                  282

It so happens that the period of dental evolution corresponds with that
of the most rapid development and the greatest functional activity of
the gastric and intestinal follicles, and the predisposition which
exists to diarrhoeal maladies at this age must be attributed to this
cause rather than to dentition.SYMPTOMS.--The summer diarrhoea of infants commonly begins gradually
with languor, fretfulness, and slight febrile movement.The diarrhoea
at first usually attracts little attention from its mildness.The
stools, while they are thinner than natural, vary in appearance, being
yellow, brown, or green.Infants with milk diet are apt to pass green
and acid stools containing particles of undigested casein.The tongue
in the commencement of the attack is moist and covered with a slight
fur.At a more advanced stage it may be moist, but is often dry, and in
dangerous forms of the malady, accompanied by prostration, the buccal
surface is red and the gums more or less swollen and sometimes
ulcerated.It may commence simultaneously with the
diarrhoea, especially when food that is unusually indigestible and
irritating to the stomach has been given, but more frequently this
symptom does not appear until the diarrhoea has continued a few days.I
preserved memoranda of the date when vomiting began in the cases
treated in two consecutive summers, and found that ordinarily it was
toward the close of the first week.When it is an early and prominent
symptom it appears to be due to the presence in the stomach of
imperfectly digested or fermented and acid food, which, when ejected,
gives a decidedly acid reaction with appropriate tests.It contains
coagulated casein and undigested particles of whatever food has been
given.In many patients the progressive loss of flesh and {734}
strength is largely due to the indigestion and vomiting by which the
food, which is so much required for proper nourishment, is lost.Emesis occurring at a late stage of the summer complaint is often due
to commencing spurious hydrocephalus, which is not an infrequent
complication, as we will see, of protracted cases.Perhaps when a late
symptom it may sometimes have an uraemic origin, for the urine is
usually quite scanty in advanced cases.It seems probable, however,
that deleterious effects from non-elimination of urea are to a
considerable extent prevented by the diarrhoea.The fecal evacuations may remain nearly uniform in appearance during
the disease, but in many patients they vary in color and consistence at
different periods.In the same case they may be brown and offensive at
one time, green at another, and again they may contain masses of a
putty-like appearance, the partly-digested casein or altered epithelial
cells.The stools sometimes consist largely of mucus, with or without
occasional streaks of blood, indicating the predominance of
inflammation in the colon.This is the mucous diarrhoea of Barrier.The
stools are sometimes yellow when passed, but become green on exposure
to the air from chemical reaction due to admixture with the urine.The character of the alvine discharges is interesting.In addition to
undigested casein I have found epithelial cells, single or in clusters
(sometimes regularly arranged as if detached in mass from the villi),
fibres of meat, crystalline formations, mucus, and occasionally blood,
as stated above.In one instance I observed an appearance resembling
three or four crypts of Lieberkuhn united, probably thrown off by
ulceration.If the stools are green, <DW52> masses of various sizes,
but mostly small, are also seen under the microscope.The pulse is accelerated according to the severity of the attack.The
heat of the surface is at first apt to be increased, though but
slightly in ordinary cases; but when the vital powers begin to fail
from the continuance of the diarrhoea the warmth of the surface
diminishes.In advanced cases approaching a fatal termination the face
and extremities are pallid and cool, and the pulse gradually becomes
more frequent and feeble.The skin is usually dry, and, as already
stated, the urinary secretion diminished.In severe cases attended by
frequent alvine discharges the infant does not pass urine oftener than
once or twice daily.The imperfect action of the skin and kidneys is
noteworthy.Protracted cases of the summer complaint are apt to be complicated by
two cutaneous eruptions--erythema extending over the perineum and
frequently as far as the thighs and lower part of the abdomen, due to
the acid and irritating character of the stools; and boils upon the
forehead and scalp.The latter sometimes extend to the pericranium, and
in case of recovery leave permanent cicatrices.This furuncular
affection of the scalp has seemed to me useful in consequence of the
external irritation which it causes, since it occurs at a time when, on
account of the feeble heart's action and languid circulation, passive
congestion of the vessels of the brain and meninges is liable to be
present.Patients who are weak and wasted in consequence of protracted
diarrhoea, remaining almost constantly in the recumbent position, often
have an occasional dry cough which continues till the close of life.It
is due to hypostatic congestion in the lungs, usually limited to the
posterior and {735} inferior portions of the lobes, extending but a
little way into the lungs.It is the result of prolonged recumbency
with feeble heart's action and feeble pulmonary circulation.Infants
reduced by chronic diseases, lying day after day in their cribs with
little movement of their bodies, are very liable to this passive
congestion of depending portions of their lungs, toward which the blood
gravitates, and into which but little air enters in consequence of
their distance and position and the feeble respirations.The hyperaemia
which results is of a passive character, a venous congestion, and the
affected lobules have a dusky-red color.This congestion, continuing,
soon results in pneumonitis of the catarrhal form, subacute and of a
low grade, for pulmonary lobules in which the blood remains stagnant
soon exhibit augmented cell-proliferation, perhaps from the irritating
effects of the elements of the blood now withdrawn from the
circulation.I have made or procured a considerable number of microscopic
examinations in these cases of hypostatic pneumonia, and the
solidification of the pulmonary lobules has been found to be due to the
exaggerated development of the epithelial cells in the alveoli,
together with venous congestion.The affected lobules, whether in the
stage of hypostatic congestion or the more advanced stage of hypostatic
pneumonitis, when examined at the autopsy, were somewhat softer than in
health, of dark color, and many of the lobules could be inflated by
strong force of the breath; but in protracted cases the alveoli in
central parts of the inflamed area resisted insufflation.The lung in
hypostatic pneumonia, even when it is inflated, still feels firmer
between the fingers than normal lung.Hypostatic pneumonia is so common in hospitals for infants that some
physicians whose observations have been chiefly in such institutions
have almost ignored other forms of pulmonary inflammation.Billard,
many years ago, wrote: "... The pneumonia of young children is
evidently the result of stagnation of blood in their lungs.Under these
circumstances the blood may be regarded as a kind of foreign body."Of
all the chronic and exhausting diseases of infancy, no one has,
according to my observations, been so frequently complicated by
hypostatic pneumonia as the disease which we are considering, although
it does not usually give rise to any more prominent symptom than an
occasional cough.Limited to a small and almost immovable part of the
lung, it does not ordinarily accelerate respiration or render it
painful, and the cough is also apparently painless.When progressive loss of flesh and strength has continued several
weeks, and the patient is much exhausted, another complication is apt
to occur, known as spurious hydrocephalus or the hydrocephaloid
disease, the anatomical characters of which will be described in the
proper place.The commencement of spurious hydrocephalus is announced
by gradually increasing drowsiness, perhaps preceded by a period of
unusual fretfulness.Vomiting and rolling the head are occasional early
symptoms of this complication.As the drowsiness increases the pupils
become less sensitive to light than in their normal state, and are
usually contracted.When the drowsiness becomes profound and constant,
the pupils remain contracted as in sound sleep or in opium narcotism.The functional activity of the organs is now also diminished, the
vomiting ceases, the stools become less frequent, the buccal surface
dry, and the urine more {736} scanty, while the pulse is more frequent
and feeble.Spurious hydrocephalus either continues till death, or by
stimulation the patient may emerge from it.Although the summer complaint in its commencement may be promptly
arrested by proper hygienic and medicinal treatment, if it continue a
few weeks the anatomical changes which occur are such that recovery, if
it take place, is necessarily slow and gradual.Improvement is shown by
better digestion, fewer stools and of better appearance, less frequent
vomiting, a more cheerful countenance, and the absence of symptoms
which indicate a complication.Many recover after days of anxious
watching and perhaps after many fluctuations.Death may occur early from a sudden aggravation of symptoms and rapid
sinking, or the attack may be so violent from the first that the infant
quickly succumbs; but more frequently death takes place after a
prolonged sickness.Little by little the patient loses flesh and
strength, till a state of marked emaciation is reached.The eyes and
cheeks are sunken, the bony projections of the face, trunk, and limbs
become prominent, and the skin lies in wrinkles from the wasting.The
altered expression of the face makes the patient look older than the
actual age.The joints in contrast with the wasted extremities seem
enlarged and the fingers and toes elongated.The stools diminish in
frequency from diminished peristaltic and vermicular action, and
vomiting, if previously present, now ceases.A feeble, quick, and
scarcely appreciable pulse, slow respiration, and diminished inflation
of the lungs, sightless and contracted pupils, over which the eyelids
no longer close, announce the near approach of death.The drowsiness
increases and the limbs become cool, while perhaps the head is hot.The
infant no longer has the ability to nurse, or if bottle-fed the food
placed in the mouth flows back or is swallowed with apparent
indifference.So low is its vitality that it lies pallid and almost
motionless for hours or even days before death, and death occurs so
quietly that the moment of its occurrence is scarcely appreciable.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Since the prominent and essential symptoms of
the disease which we are considering pertain to the digestive
apparatus, it is evident that the lesions which attend and characterize
it are to be found in this part of the system.Lesions elsewhere, so
far as they are appreciable to us, are secondary and not essential.I
have witnessed a large number of autopsies of infants who have perished
from the summer complaint, chiefly in institutions, and they have been
sufficiently marked and uniform to enable us to designate it an
entero-colitis.Several years since I preserved records of the
autopsical appearances in the intestinal catarrh of infants, most of
the cases being of summer diarrhoea.Since then I have each summer witnessed autopsies in the institutions
in cases of this disease, and the lesions observed were the same as in
the eighty-two cases.The question may properly be asked: Can inflammatory hyperaemia of the
intestinal mucous membrane be distinguished from simple congestion if
there be no ulceration and no appreciable thickening of the intestine?It is possible that occasionally I have recorded as inflammatory what
was simply a congestive lesion, but I do not think I have incorporated
a {737} sufficient number of such cases to vitiate the statistics.In a
large proportion of the cases there was evident thickening of the
intestinal mucous membrane or other unequivocal evidence of
inflammation.The following is an analysis of the eighty-two cases:

The duodenum and jejunum presented the appearance of inflammatory
hyperaemia in 12 cases.The hyperaemia was usually in patches of
variable extent or of that form described by the term arborescent.In
51 cases the duodenal and jejunal mucous membrane was pale and without
any other appearance characteristic of catarrh or inflammation.In the
remaining 19 cases the appearance of the duodenum and jejunum was not
recorded, so that it was probably normal.On the other hand, in the
ileum inflammatory lesions were present as a rule.In 49 cases I found
the surface of the ileum distinctly hyperaemic, and in that portion of
it nearest the ileo-caecal valve, including the valve itself, the
inflammation had evidently been the most intense, since in this portion
the hyperaemia and thickening of the mucous membrane were most marked.In 16 cases the surface of the ileum appeared nearly or quite normal;
in 14 hyperaemia in the small intestines in patches, streaks, or
arborescence was recorded, but the records do not state in which
division of the intestines they were observed.Billard, with other observers, has noticed the frequency and intensity
of the inflammatory lesions in entero-colitis in the terminal portion
of the small intestines, and the thickening in many cases of the
ileo-caecal valve, and he asks whether the vomiting which is so common
and often obstinate in this disease may not be sometimes due to
obstruction to the passage of fecal matter at the valve in consequence
of the hyperaemia and swelling, but has not observed any retained fecal
matter above it, such as we find in any part of the colon, or any other
appearance which indicated sufficient obstruction to cause symptoms.Still, it seems not improbable that the reason why the inflammatory
lesions are more pronounced at and immediately above the valve than in
other parts of the small intestine is that the fecal matter, so
commonly acid and irritating in this disease, is somewhat delayed in
its passage downward at this point.Small superficial circular or oval ulcers were observed in the ileum in
4 cases, in 2 of which they were found also in the lower part of the
jejunum.In 1 case the records state that ulcers were in the jejunum,
but do not mention whether they were also in the ileum.In 1 case, in
which there was much thickening of the ileum next to the ileo-caecal
valve, many small granulations had sprouted up from the submucous
connective tissue, so that the mucous surface appeared as if studded
with small warts.Softening of the mucous membrane was also apparent in certain cases.The firmness of its attachment to the parts underneath varied
considerably in different specimens.I was able in cases in which there
was considerable softening to detach readily the mucous membrane with
the nail or handle of the scalpel within so short a period after death
that it was probable that the change of consistence was not cadaveric.In some cases the vessels of the submucous tissue were injected and
this tissue infiltrated.In all the cases except one lesions were present indicating
inflammation {738} of the mucous membrane of the colon.In 39
hyperaemia, thickening, and other signs of inflammation extended over
nearly or quite the entire colon; in 14 the colitis was confined to the
descending portion entirely or almost entirely; in 28 cases the records
state that inflammatory lesions were found in the colon, but their
exact location is not mentioned.In 18 of the autopsies the mucous
membrane of the colon was found ulcerated.Therefore, according to these statistics--and autopsies which I have
witnessed that are not embraced in them disclosed similar
lesions--colitis is present, almost without exception, in cases of
summer diarrhoea, associated with more or less ileitis.The portion of
the colon which presents the most marked inflammatory lesions is that
in and immediately above the sigmoid flexure--that portion, therefore,
in which any fermenting fecal matter has reached its greatest degree of
fermentation, and consequently contains the most irritating elements,
and where, next to the caput coli, it is longest delayed in its passage
downward.The solitary glands of both the large and small intestines and Peyer's
patches undergo hyperplasia.In cases of short duration, and in parts
of the intestine where the inflammatory action has been mild, the
solitary glands present a vascular appearance, like the surrounding
membrane, and are slightly enlarged.The enlargement is most apparent
if the intestine be viewed by transmitted light, when not only are the
glands seen to be swollen, but their central dark points are distinct.If a higher grade of intestinal catarrh or a catarrh more protracted
have occurred, the volume of these follicles is so increased that they
rise above the common level and present a papillary appearance.Peyer's
patches are also distinct and punctate.The enlargement of Peyer's
patches, like that of the solitary glands, is due to hyperplasia, the
elementary cells being largely increased in number.The small ulcers which, as we have seen from the above statistics, are
present in a certain proportion of cases in the mucous membrane of the
colon, and more rarely in that of the small intestine when the
inflammation has been protracted and of a severe type, appear to occur
in the solitary glands and in the mucous membrane surrounding them.While some of these glands in a specimen are simply tumefied, others
are slightly ulcerated, and others still nearly or quite destroyed.The
ulcers are usually from one to three lines in diameter, circular or
oval, with edges slightly raised from infiltration.Rarely, I have seen
minute coagula of blood in one or more ulcers, and I have also observed
ulcers which have evidently been larger and have partially healed.The
ulcers are more frequently found in the descending colon than in other
portions of the intestines.When ulcers are present they commonly occur
in the descending colon, or if occurring elsewhere they are most
abundant in this situation.According to my observations, these ulcers are found chiefly in infants
over the age of six months--during the time, therefore, when there is
greatest functional activity and most rapid development of the solitary
glands.Peyer's patches, though frequently prominent and distinct, have
not been ulcerated in any of the cases observed by me.The appendix vermiformis participates in the catarrh when it occurs in
the caput coli, its mucous membrane being hyperaemic and thickened.In
{739} certain rare cases the inflammation is so intense that a thin
film of fibrin is exuded in places upon the surface of the colon.It is
apt to be overlooked or to be washed away in the examination.The
rectum usually presents no inflammatory lesions, or but slight lesions
in comparison with those in the colon.It usually remains of the normal
pale color, or but slightly vascular even when there is almost general
colitis.Hence the infrequency of tenesmus.As might be expected from the nature of the disease, the secretion of
mucus from the intestinal surface is augmented.It is often seen
forming a layer upon the intestinal surface, and it appears in the
stools mixed with epithelial cells and sometimes with blood and pus.The mesenteric glands in cases which have run the most protracted
course and end fatally are found more or less enlarged from
hyperplasia.They are frequently as large as a pea or larger, and of a
light color, the color being due not only to the hyperplasia, but in
part to the anaemia.Occasionally, when patients have been much reduced
from the long continuance of the diarrhoea, and are in a state of
marked cachexia at death, we find certain of these glands caseous.The condition of the stomach is interesting, since indigestion and
vomiting are so commonly present.I have records of its appearance in
59 cases, in 42 of which it seemed normal, having the usual pale color
and exhibiting only such changes as occur in the cadaver.In the
remaining 17 cases the stomach was more or less hyperaemic, and in 3 of
them points of ulceration were observed in the mucous membrane.All physicians familiar with this disease have remarked the frequency
of stomatitis.In protracted and grave cases it is a common
complication.The buccal surface in these cases is more vascular than
natural, and if the vital powers are much reduced superficial
ulcerations are not infrequent, oftener upon the gums than elsewhere.The gums are apt to be spongy, more or less swollen, bleeding readily
when rubbed or pressed upon.Thrush is a common complication of the
summer complaint in infants under the age of three or four months, but
is infrequent in older infants.Occurring in those over the age of six
or eight months, it has an unfavorable prognostic significance,
indicating a form of summer diarrhoea which commonly eventuates in
death.The belief has long been prevalent in the past that the liver is also
in fault.The green color of the stools was supposed to be due to
vitiated bile.But usually in the post-mortem examinations which I have
made I have found that the green coloration of the fecal matter did not
appear at the point where the bile enters the intestines, but at some
point below the ductus communis choledochus in the jejunum or ileum.The green tinge, at first slight, becomes more and more distinct on
tracing it downward in the intestine.It appears to be due to admixture
of the intestinal secretions with the fecal matter.I have notes of the appearance and state of the liver in 32 fatal
cases.Nothing could be seen in these examinations which indicated any
anatomical change in this organ that could be attributed to the
diarrhoeal malady.The size and weight of the liver varied considerably
in infants of the same age, but probably there was no greater
difference than usually obtains among glandular organs in a state of
health.The following was the weight of this organ in 20 cases: {740}

    Age.4 weeks   5     ounces.| 10 months   6-3/4 ounces.2 months  3-1/2   "      | 13   "      6       "
  2   "     3-1/2   "      | 14   "      9       "
  4   "     5       "      | 15   "      6       "
  5   "     6-1/2   "      | 15   "      7-1/2   "
  5   "     9       "      | 15   "      9-1/2   "
  7   "     4-1/2   "      | 16   "      6       "
  7   "     6       "      | 19   "      4-1/2   "
  7   "     6-1/4   "      | 20   "      9-1/4   "
  9   "     8       "      | 23   "     15       "

In none of these cases did the size, weight, or appearance of this
organ seem to be different from that in health or in other diseases,
except in one in which fatty degeneration had occurred, but this was
probably due to tuberculosis, which was also present.In most of these
cases the liver was examined microscopically, and the only noteworthy
appearance observed was the variable amount of oil-globules in the
hepatic cells.In some specimens the oil-globules were in excess, in
others deficient, and in others still they were more abundant in one
part of the organ than in another.Little importance was attached to
these differences in the quantity of oily matter.Hypostatic congestion of the posterior portions of the lungs, ending if
it continue in a form of subacute catarrhal pneumonia and giving rise
to an occasional painless cough, has been described in the preceding
pages.The character of the cough in connection with the wasting might
excite suspicions of the presence of tubercles in the lungs; but
tubercles are rare in this disease, and when present I should suspect a
strong hereditary predisposition.They occurred in only 1 of the 82
cases.The state of the encephalon in those patients in whom spurious
hydrocephalus occurs is interesting.In protracted cases of the
diarrhoea the brain wastes like the body and limbs.In the young
infant, in whom the cranial bones are still ununited, the occipital and
sometimes the frontal bones become depressed and overlapped by the
parietal, the depression being of course proportionate to the
diminution in size of the encephalon.In older children, with the cranial bones consolidated, serous effusion
occurs according to the degree of waste, thus preserving the size of
the encephalon.The effusion is chiefly external to the brain, lying
over the convolutions from the base to the vertex.Its quantity varies
from one or two drachms to an ounce or more.Along with this serous
effusion, and antedating it, passive congestion of the cerebral veins
and sinuses is also present.This congestion is the obvious and
necessary result of the feebleness of the heart's action and the loss
of brain substance.DIAGNOSIS.--The occurrence and continuance of diarrhoea in the warm
months, without any apparent cause except the agencies which hot
weather produces, indicate this disease.The exciting cause of the
attack may be the use of some indigestible and irritating substance,
dietetic or medicinal, as fruits with their seeds or a purgative
medicine; but if it continue after the immediate effects of the agent
have passed off, it is proper to attribute the diarrhoea to the summer
season.In the adult abdominal tenderness is an important diagnostic symptom of
intestinal catarrh, but in the infant this symptom is lacking or is not
in general appreciable, so that it does not aid in diagnosis.When the
{741} diagnosis of the disease is established, the symptoms do not
usually indicate what part of the intestinal surface is chiefly
involved, but it may be assumed that it is the lower part of the ileum
and the colon.The presence of mucus or of mucus tinged with blood in
the stools shows the predominance of colitis.PROGNOSIS.--Although this disease every summer largely increases the
death-rate of young children, most cases can be cured if the proper
hygienic and medicinal measures be early applied.It is obvious, from
what has been stated in the foregoing pages, that cholera infantum is
the form of this malady which involves greatest danger.Except in such
cases there is sufficient forewarning of a fatal result, for if death
occur it is after a lingering sickness, with fluctuations and gradual
loss of flesh and strength.Patients often recover from a state of
great prostration and emaciation, provided that no fatal complications
arise.The eyes may be sunken, the skin lie in folds from the wasting,
the strength may be so exhausted that any other than the recumbent
position is impossible, and yet the patient may recover by removal to
the country, by change of weather, or by the use of better diet and
remedies.Therefore an absolutely unfavorable prognosis should not be
made except in cases that are complicated or that border on collapse.The most dangerous symptoms, except those which indicate commencing or
actual collapse, arise from the state of the brain.Rolling the head,
squinting, feeble action or permanent contraction of the pupils,
spasmodic or irregular movements of the limbs, indicate the near
approach of death, as do also coldness of face and extremities and
inability to swallow.It is obvious also that in making the prognosis
in ordinary cases we should consider the age of the patient, the state
of the weather, the time in the summer, whether in the beginning or
near its close, and the surroundings, especially in reference to the
impurity of the air, as well as the patient's condition.Cholera Infantum, or Choleriform Diarrhoea.This is the most severe form of the summer complaint.It receives the
name which designates it from the violence of its symptoms, which
closely resemble those of Asiatic cholera.It is, however, quite
distinct from that disease.It is characterized by frequent stools,
vomiting, great elevation of temperature, and rapid and great
emaciation and loss of strength.It commonly occurs under the age of
two years.It sometimes begins abruptly, the previous health having
been good; in other cases it is preceded by the ordinary form of summer
diarrhoea.The stools have been thinner than natural and somewhat more
frequent, but not such as to excite alarm, when suddenly they become
more frequent and watery, and the parents are surprised and frightened
by the rapid sinking and real danger of the infant.The first evacuations, unless there have been previous diarrhoea, may
contain fecal matter, but subsequently they are so thin that they soak
into the diaper like urine, and in some cases they scarcely produce
more of a stain than does this secretion.Their odor is peculiar--not
fecal, but musty and offensive, and occasionally almost odorless.Commencing simultaneously with the watery evacuations or soon after is
another {742} symptom, irritability of the stomach, which increases
greatly the prostration and danger.Whatever drinks are swallowed by
the infant are rejected immediately or after a few moments, or retching
may occur without vomiting.The appetite is lost and the thirst is
intense.Cold water is taken with avidity, and if the infant nurse it
eagerly seizes the breast in order to relieve the thirst.The tongue is
moist at first, and clean or covered with a light fur, pulse
accelerated, respiration either natural or somewhat increased in
frequency, and the surface warm, but the temperature is speedily
reduced in severe cases.The internal temperature or that of the blood
is always very high.In ordinary cases of cholera infantum the
thermometer introduced into the rectum rises to or above 105 degrees,
and I have seen it indicate 107 degrees.Although the infant may be
restless at first, it does not appear to have any abdominal pain or
tenderness.The restlessness is apparently due to thirst or to that
unpleasant sensation which the sick feel when the vital powers are
rapidly reduced.The urine is scanty in proportion to the gravity of
the attack, as it ordinarily is when the stools are frequent and
watery.The emaciation and loss of strength are more rapid than in any other
disease which I can recall to mind, unless in Asiatic cholera.In a few
hours the parents scarcely recognize in the changed and melancholy
aspect of the infant any resemblance to the features which it exhibited
a day or two before.The eyes are sunken, the eyelids and lips are
permanently open from the feeble contractile power of the muscles which
close them, while the loss of the fluids from the tissues and the
emaciation are such that the bony angles become more prominent and the
skin in places lies in folds.As the disease approaches a fatal termination, which often occurs in
two or three days, the infant remains quiet, not disturbed even by the
flies which alight upon its face.The limbs and face become cool, the
eyes bleared, pupils contracted, and the urine scanty or suppressed.In
some instances, when the patient is near death, the respiration becomes
accelerated, either from the effect of the disease upon the respiratory
centres or from pulmonary congestion resulting from the feeble
circulation.As the vital powers fail the pulse becomes progressively
more feeble, the surface has a clammy coldness, the contracted pupils
no longer respond to light, and the stupor deepens, from which it is
impossible to arouse the infant.In the most favorable cases cholera infantum is checked before the
occurrence of these grave symptoms, and often in cases which are
ultimately fatal there is not such a speedy termination of the malady
as is indicated in the above description.The choleriform diarrhoea
abates and the case becomes one of ordinary summer complaint.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Rilliet and Barthez, who of foreign writers
treat of cholera infantum at greatest length, describe it under the
name of gastro-intestinal choleriform catarrh."The perusal," they
remark, "of anatomico-pathological descriptions, and especially the
study of the facts, show that the gastro-intestinal tube in subjects
who succumb to this disease may be in four different states: (_a_)
either the stomach is softened without any lesion of the digestive
tube; (_b_) or the stomach is softened at the same time that the mucous
membrane of the intestine, and especially its follicular apparatus, is
diseased; (_c_) or the stomach is healthy, {743} while the follicular
apparatus or the mucous membrane is diseased; (_d_) or, finally, the
gastro-intestinal tube is not the seat of any lesion appreciable to our
senses in the present state of our knowledge, or it presents lesions so
insignificant that they are not sufficient to explain the gravity of
the symptoms."So far, the disease resembles all the catarrhs, but what is special is
the abundance of serous secretion and the disturbance of the great
sympathetic nerve."The serous secretion, which appears to be produced by a perspiration
(analogous to that of the respiratory passages and of the skin) rather
than by a follicular secretion, shows, perhaps, that the elimination of
substances is effected by other organs than the follicles; perhaps,
also, we ought to see a proof that the materials to eliminate are not
the same as in simple catarrh.Upon all these points we are constrained
to remain in doubt.We content ourselves with pointing out the
fact."[2]

[Footnote 2: _Maladies des Enfants_.]On the 1st of August, 1861, I made the autopsy of an infant sixteen
months old who died of cholera infantum with a sickness of less than
one day.Nothing
unusual was observed in the brain, unless perhaps a little more than
the ordinary injection of vessels at the vertex.No marked anatomical
change was observed in the stomach and intestines, except enlargement
of the patches of Peyer as well as of the solitary and mesenteric
glands.In this and the following cases there was
apparently slight softening of the intestinal mucous membrane, but
whether it was pathological or cadaveric was uncertain, as the weather
was very warm.Examined by the microscope, it
was found to contain about the normal number of oil-globules.The second case was that of an infant seven months old, wet-nursed, who
died July 26, 1862, after a sickness also of about one day.He was
previously emaciated, but without any marked ailment.The post-mortem
examination was made on the 28th.The brain was somewhat softer than
natural, but otherwise healthy.There was no abnormal vascularity of
the membranes of the brain, and no serous effusion within the cranium.The mucous membrane of the intestines had nearly the normal color
throughout, but it seemed somewhat thickened and softened; the solitary
glands of the colon were prominent.The patches of Peyer were not
distinct.In the New York Protestant Episcopal Orphan Asylum an infant twenty
months old, previously healthy, was seized with cholera infantum on the
25th of June, 1864.The alvine evacuations, as is usual with this
disease, were frequent and watery, and attended by obstinate vomiting.Death occurred in slight spasms in thirty-six hours.The exciting cause
was probably the use of a few currants which were eaten in a cake the
day before, some of which fruit was contained in the first evacuations.The only pathological changes which were
observed in the stomach and intestines were slightly vascular patches
in the small intestines and an unusual prominence of the solitary
glands in the colon.The glands resembled small beads imbedded in the
mucous membrane.The lungs in the above cases were healthy, excepting
hypostatic congestion.{744} Since the date of these autopsies I have made others in cases
which terminated fatally after a brief duration, and have uniformly
found similar lesions--namely, the gastro-intestinal surface either
without vascularity or scantily vascular in streaks or patches,
sometimes presenting a whitish or soggy appearance and somewhat
softened, while the solitary glands were enlarged so as to be prominent
upon the surface.In cases which continue longer evident inflammatory
lesions soon appear which are identical with those which have already
been described in our remarks on the ordinary form of the summer
diarrhoea.During my term of service in the New York Foundling Asylum in the
summer of 1884, an infant died after a brief illness with all the
symptoms of cholera infantum, and the intestines were sent to William
H. Welch, now of Johns Hopkins Hospital, for microscopic examination.His report was as follows: "I found undoubted evidence of acute
inflammation.There was an increased number of small, round cells
(leucocytes) in the mucous and submucous coats.This accumulation of
new cells was most abundant in and around the solitary follicles, which
were greatly swollen.Clumps of lymphoid cells were found extending
even a little into the muscular coat.The epithelial lining of the
intestine was not demonstrable, but this is usually the case with
post-mortem specimens of human intestine, and justifies no inferences
as to pathological changes.The glands of Lieberkuhn were rich in the
so-called goblet-cells, and some of the glands were distended with
mucus and desquamated epithelium, so as to present sometimes the
appearance of little cysts.This was observed especially in the
neighborhood of the solitary follicles.The blood-vessels, especially
the veins of the submucous coat, were abnormally distended with blood.I searched for micro-organisms, and found them in abundance upon the
free surface of the intestine in the mucous accumulations there, and
also in the mouths of the glands of Lieberkuhn.Both rod-shaped and
small round bacteria were found.I attach no especial importance to
finding bacteria upon the surface of the intestine.The general result
of the examination is to confirm the view that cholera infantum is
characterized by an acute intestinal inflammation."NATURE.--Cholera infantum appears from its symptoms and lesions to be
the most severe form of intestinal catarrh to which infants are liable.The alvine discharges, to which the rapid prostration is largely due,
probably consist in part of intestinal secretions and in part of serum
which has transuded from the capillaries of the intestines.That the
intestinal mucous membrane sometimes presents a pale appearance at the
autopsy of an infant who, previously well, has died of cholera infantum
after a sickness of twenty-four or forty-eight hours, is perhaps due to
the great amount of liquid secretion and transudation in which the
inflamed surface is bathed.Moreover, it is, I believe, a recognized
fact that the hyperaemia of an acutely-inflamed surface when of short
duration frequently disappears in the cadaver, as that of scarlet fever
and erysipelas.The early hyperplasia of the solitary and mesenteric
glands, and the hyperaemia and thickening of the surface of the ileum
and colon in those who have survived a few days, indicate the
inflammatory character of the malady.The opinion has been expressed by certain observers that cholera {745}
infantum is identical with thermic fever or sunstroke.There is indeed
a resemblance to thermic fever as regards certain important symptoms.In cholera infantum the temperature is from 105 degrees to 108 degrees;
in sunstroke it is also very high, often running above 108 degrees.Great heat of head, contracted pupils, thin fecal evacuations,
embarrassed respiration, scanty urine, and cerebral symptoms are common
toward the close of cholera infantum, and they are the prominent
symptoms in sunstroke.Nevertheless, I cannot accept the theory which
regards these maladies as identical, and which removes cholera infantum
from the list of intestinal diseases.In cholera infantum the
gastro-intestinal symptoms always take the precedence, and are, except
in advanced cases, always more prominent than other symptoms.It does
not commence as by a stroke like coup de soleil, but it comes on more
gradually, though rapidly, and it often supervenes upon a diarrhoea or
some error of diet.In the commencement of cholera infantum the infant
is not apt to be drowsy, and it is often wide awake and restless from
the thirst.Contrast this with the alarming stupor of sunstroke.Sunstroke only occurs during the hours of excessive heat, but cholera
infantum may occur at any hour or in any day during the hot weather,
provided that there be sufficient dietetic cause.Again, intestinal
inflammation is not common in sunstroke, while it is the common or, as
I believe, the essential lesion of cholera infantum.These facts show,
in my opinion, that the two maladies are essentially and entirely
distinct.Nevertheless, cases of apparent sunstroke sometimes occur in
the infant, and if the bowels are at the same time relaxed the disease
is apt to be regarded as cholera infantum, and if fatal is usually
reported as such to the health authorities.Cases of this kind I have
occasionally observed or they have been reported to me, although they
are not common.With the exception of the organs of digestion no uniform lesions are
observed in any of the viscera in cholera infantum, except such as are
due to change in the quantity and fluidity of the blood and its
circulation.Writers describe an anaemic appearance of the thoracic and
abdominal viscera, and occasionally passive congestion of the cerebral
vessels.The cerebral symptoms often present toward the close of life
in unfavorable cases of cholera infantum are often due to spurious
hydrocephalus, which we have described above; but as the urinary
secretion is scanty or suppressed, cerebral symptoms may in certain
cases be due to uraemia.DIAGNOSIS.--This form of the summer diarrhoea is diagnosticated by the
symptoms, and especially by the frequency and character of the stools.The stools have already been described as frequent, often passed with
considerable force, deficient in fecal matter, and thin, so as to soak
into the diaper almost like urine.The vomiting, thirst, rapid sinking,
and emaciation serve to distinguish cholera infantum from other
diarrhoeal maladies.When Asiatic cholera is prevalent the differential diagnosis between
the two is difficult if not impossible.PROGNOSIS.--Cholera infantum is one of those diseases in regard to
which physicians often injure their reputation by not giving sufficient
notice of the danger, or even by expressing a favorable opinion when
the case soon after ends fatally.A favorable prognosis should seldom
be expressed without qualification.If the urgent symptoms be relieved,
{746} still the disease may continue as an ordinary intestinal
inflammation, which in hot weather is formidable and often fatal.If
the stools become more consistent and less frequent without the
occurrence of cerebral symptoms, while the limbs are warm and the pulse
good, we may confidently express the opinion that there is no present
danger.The duration of true cholera infantum is short.It either ends fatally,
or it begins soon to abate and ceases, or it continues, and is not to
be distinguished in its subsequent course from an attack of summer
diarrhoea beginning in the ordinary manner.TREATMENT.--Preventive Measures.--Obviously, efficient preventive
measures consist in the removal of infants so far as practicable from
the operation of the causes which produce the disease.Weaning just
before or in the hot weather should, if possible, be avoided, and
removal to the country should be recommended, especially for those who
are deprived of the breast-milk during the age when such nutriment is
required.If for any reason it is necessary to employ artificial
feeding for infants under the age of ten months, that food should
obviously be used which most closely resembles human milk in
digestibility and in nutritive properties.Care should be taken to
prevent fermentation in the food before its use, since much harm is
done by the employment of milk or other food in which fermentative
changes have occurred and which occur quickly in dietetic mixtures in
the hot months.It is also very important that the infant receive its food in proper
quantity and at proper intervals, for if the mother or nurse in her
anxiety to have it thrive feed it too often or in too large quantity,
the surplus food which it cannot digest if not vomited undergoes
fermentation, and consequently becomes irritating to the
gastro-intestinal surface.The physician should be able to give advice
not only in reference to the frequency of feeding, but also in regard
to the quantity of food which the infant requires at each feeding.Correct knowledge and advice in this matter aid in the prevention and
cure of the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Chadbourne of this city and myself made some observations in order to
ascertain how much food well-nourished infants receive daily.We
selected infants that had an abundance of breast-milk, and weighed them
before and after each nursing, so as to determine how much each infant
took during twenty-four hours.The avoirdupois ounce contains 437.5
grains, and we ascertained by careful weight and measurement, employing
the metric system for its greater accuracy, that one fluidounce of
human milk, with a specific gravity of 1.031, weighed 451.9 grains.With these data it was easy to determine the quantity of milk in
fluidounces from its weight.Our first observations related to 12
infants under the age of five weeks, 8 of which nursed twelve times,
and the remaining 4 eight, nine, nine, and eleven times respectively,
in the twenty-four hours.The quantity of milk received by them in
twenty-four hours varied considerably in the different cases, but the
average was 12.41 fluidounces.Therefore if a baby in the first five
weeks nurse every two hours, it receives only a little more than one
fluidounce at each nursing.The next observations were made upon 15 infants between the ages of
five weeks and ten months: 8 of the 15 were under the age of six {747}
months, and the remaining 7 were between the ages of six months and ten
months.The weighing showed that the younger took nearly the same
quantity per day, on the average, as the older infants in this group.The average quantity received by each was twenty-four and six-tenths
fluidounces.Hence if the nursings were eight in the twenty-four hours,
three ounces were taken at each nursing; if the nursings were twelve,
the quantity each time was two ounces.Biedert of Germany has also made similar observations in order to
determine the amount of nutriment required by infants.The results of
his weight-studies, as he designates them, were published in the
_Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde_, xix.B., 3 H. His weighing showed that
infants during their first month, if fed on cow's milk, required from
160 to 200 grammes of milk daily, and in the third month 300 grammes.These quantities in fluid measure are 5.44 to 6.83 ounces, the quantity
required each day in the first month, and 10.22 ounces, the quantity
required daily the second month.Therefore, both my weights and
Biedert's show that infants under the age of two months assimilate a
smaller quantity of milk than is usually supposed.For infants older
than two months he estimates the quantity of milk required by infants
by their weight.He believes that the greater the weight the greater is
the amount of food which the infant needs.The method pursued by
Chadbourne and myself is more simple, and it seems to indicate with
sufficient exactness the amount of food required.Some infants, like adults, need more food than others, so that there
can be no exact schedule of the quantity which they require at each
feeding; but while in the first and second months they do not need more
than from one to one and a half fluidounces at each feeding, whether of
breast-milk, or of cow's milk prepared so as to resemble as closely as
possible human milk, infants as they grow older and their stomachs
enlarge can take food in larger quantity, and therefore require less
frequent feeding.Under the age of two months the stomach is so small
that it cannot receive much more than one or one and a half fluidounces
without undue distension.At the age of six months it can probably
receive and digest without discomfort three ounces, and in the last
half of the first year even four ounces.Infants nourished at the
breast should be allowed to nurse every two hours in the daytime,
whatever the age, after the second month, but less frequently at night,
for frequent nursing promotes the secretion of milk, and the milk is of
better quality than when it is long retained in the breast.If by the
fifth or sixth month mothers or wet-nurses find, as is frequently the
case, that they do not have sufficient milk, other food should be given
in addition, perhaps after each second nursing or every fourth hour.The kind of food which it is best to employ to supplement the nursing
will be mentioned under the head of curative measures.By knowledge on
the part of the mother and nurse of the dietetic needs of the infant,
and by consequent judicious alimentation, and by measures also to
procure the utmost purity of the air, there can be no doubt that the
summer diarrhoea may to a great extent be prevented.Curative Treatment.--The indications for treatment are--1st, to provide
the best possible food; 2d, to procure pure air; 3d, to aid the
digestive function of the infant; 4th, to employ such medicinal agents
as can be safely given to check the diarrhoea and cure the intestinal
catarrh.{748} The infant with this disease is thirsty, and is therefore apt to
take more nutriment in the liquid form than it requires for its
sustenance.If nursing, it craves the breast, or if weaned, craves the
bottle, at short intervals to relieve the thirst.No more nutriment
should be allowed than is required for nutrition, for the reason stated
above, and the thirst may best be relieved by a little cold water,
gum-water, or barley-water, to which a few drops of brandy or whiskey
are added.Since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea is the use of improper food, it is obviously very important
for the successful treatment of this disease that the food should be of
the right kind, properly prepared, and given in proper quantity.I need
not repeat that for infants under the age of one year no food is so
suitable as breast-milk, and one affected with the diarrhoea and
remaining in the city should, if possible, at least if under the age of
ten months, be provided with breast-milk.It can be more satisfactorily
treated and the chances of its recovery are much greater if it be
nourished with human milk than by any other kind of diet.If, however,
the mother's milk fail or become unsuitable from ill-health or
pregnancy, and on account of family circumstances a wet-nurse cannot be
procured, the important and difficult duty devolves upon the physician
of deciding how the infant should be fed.In order to solve this
problem it will be well to recall to mind the part performed in the
digestive function by the different secretions which digest food:

1st.It converts starch into glucose
or grape-sugar.It has no effect upon fat or the protein group.It is
the secretion of the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands,
which in infants under the age of three months are very small, almost
rudimentary.The two parotid glands at the age of one month weigh only
thirty-four grains.The power to convert starch into sugar possessed by
saliva is due to a ferment which it contains called ptyalin.The gastric juice is a thin, nearly transparent, and colorless
fluid, acid from the presence of a little hydrochloric acid.It
produces no change in starch, grape-sugar, or the fats, except that it
dissolves the covering of the fat-cells.Its function is to convert the
proteids into peptone, which is effected by its active principle,
termed pepsin.The bile is alkaline and neutralizes the acid product of gastric
digestion.It forms soaps with the
fatty acids and has a slight emulsifying action on fat.The soaps are
said to promote the emulsion of fat.Their emulsifying power is
believed to be increased by admixture with the pancreatic secretion.Moreover, the absorption of oil is facilitated by the presence of bile
upon the surface through which it passes.The pancreatic juice appears to have the function of digesting
whatever alimentary substance has escaped digestion by the saliva,
gastric juice, and bile.It is a clear, viscid liquid of alkaline
reaction.It converts proteids
into peptones and emulsifies fats.While the gastric juice requires an
acid medium for the performance of its digestive function, the
pancreatic juice requires one that is alkaline.This important fact
should be borne in mind, that such a mistake as presenting pepsin with
chalk mixture, or the extractum pancreatis with dilute muriatic acid,
may be avoided.The intestinal secretions are mainly from the crypts of
Lieberkuhn, and their action in the digestive process is probably
comparatively unimportant, but in some animals they have been found to
digest starch.It will be observed that of all these secretions that
which digests the largest number of nutritive principles is the
pancreatic.It digests all those which are essential to the maintenance
of life except fat, and it aids the bile in emulsifying fat.One of the most important conferences in paediatrics ever held convened
at Salzburg in 1881 for the purpose of considering the diet of infants.Among those who participated in the discussion were men known
throughout the world as authorities in children's diseases, such as
Demme, Biedert, Gerhardt, Henoch, Steffen, Thomas, and Soltmann.None
of the physicians present dissented from the following proposition of
the chairman: That "all the advances made in physiology in respect to
the digestive organs of children only go to prove that the mother's
milk is the only true material which is quantitatively and
qualitatively suited to the development of the child, which preserves
the physiological functions of the organs of digestion, and under
favorable circumstances of growth unfolds the whole organism in its
completeness."All agreed that when the breast-milk fails animal milk
is the best substitute.Henoch, who was one of the conference,
expresses the same opinion in his well-known treatise on diseases of
children, as follows: "Cow's milk is the best substitute for mother's
milk during the entire period of infancy.I consider the administration
of other substances advisable only when good cow's milk cannot be
obtained or when it gives rise to constant vomiting and diarrhoea."The many infants' foods contained in the shops were considered by the
conference, and, in the words of the chairman, "Now and evermore it is
unanimously agreed that these preparations can in no way be substituted
for mother's milk, and as exclusive food during the first year are to
be entirely and completely rejected."But, unfortunately, we soon learn
by experience that animal milk, although it is the best of the
substitutes for human milk, is, especially as dispensed in the cities,
faulty.It is digested with difficulty by young infants, and is apt to
cause in them diarrhoea and intestinal catarrh.Therefore in the hot
months its use is very apt to act as one of the dietetic causes of the
summer diarrhoea in infants exclusively fed upon it, unless it be
specially prepared so as to more closely resemble human milk.The
frequent unsatisfactory results of its use have led to the preparation
of the many proprietary substitutes for human milk which the shops
contain, and which have been so summarily discarded by the German
conference.Woman's milk in health is always alkaline.It has a specific gravity of
1.0317; cow's milk has a specific gravity of 1.029.That of cows
stabled and fed upon other fodder than hay or grass is usually
decidedly acid.That from cows in the country with good pasturage is
said to be alkaline, but in two dairies in Central New York a hundred
miles apart, in midsummer, with an abundant pasturage, two competent
persons whom I requested to make the examinations found the milk
slightly acid immediately after the milking in all the cows.The following results of a large number of analyses of woman's and
cow's milk, made by Konig and quoted by Leeds, and of several of the
{750} best known and most used preparations designed by their inventors
to be substitutes for human milk, show how far these substitutes
resemble the natural aliment in their chemical characters:

It is seen by examination of the analyses of the above foods that all
except such as consist largely or wholly of cow's milk differ widely
from human milk in their composition, and although some of them--as the
Liebig preparations, in which starch is converted into glucose by the
action of the diastase of malt--may aid in the nutrition and be useful
as adjuncts to milk, physicians of experience and close observation
will, I think, agree with the German conference that when breast-milk
fails or is insufficient our main reliance for the successful nutrition
of the infant must be on animal milk.Nestle's Food, which consists of
wheat flour, the yelk of egg, condensed milk, and sugar, and which has
been so largely used in this country and in Europe, is probably
beneficial mainly from the large amount of Swiss condensed milk which
it contains.Although the preference is to be given to animal milk over any other
kind of food as a substitute for human milk, yet even when obtained
fresh and from the best dairies and properly diluted it is very apt to
disagree with infants under the age of one year, producing indigestion
and diarrhoea.The close resemblance in chemical character of cow's,
ass's, and goat's milk to human milk would lead us to expect that
either would be a good substitute for the latter.The fact that the
milk of these animals is apt to cause indigestion and intestinal
catarrh, especially in the hot months, when the digestive function of
the infant is enfeebled from the heat, must be due to the quality
rather than quantity of its constituents.The difference in quality of
the casein of human and animal milk is well known, since that of human
milk coagulates in the stomach in flakes, and that of animal milk in
firm and large masses.The German conference saw at once the importance
of the problem which confronted them--_i.e._ how to modify cow's milk
so that it bears the closest possible resemblance to human milk.They
even discussed the difference of the milk of different breeds of cows,
and the proper feeding and care of cows, but the most important
suggestion made--and one which has already produced good results in
this country and in Europe, and promises to be instrumental in saving
the lives of many infants who by the old method of feeding would
inevitably perish--was made by Pfeiffer of Wiesbaden.I allude to the
peptonizing of milk.The pancreatic secretion digests milk that is
rendered alkaline at a temperature between 100 degrees and 150 degrees
F. Milk thus treated becomes in from twenty minutes to one hour
thinner, resembling human milk in appearance, and if the peptonizing be
continued beyond a certain point, and is more complete, its taste is
decidedly {752} bitter.The process should be watched and the
peptonizing suspended as soon as the bitterness becomes appreciable,
for, although more advanced peptonizing so changes the milk that it is
more easily digested by the infant than when the peptonizing is
partial, yet the bitterness which is imparted to it renders it very
disagreeable as a dietetic preparation.Milk thus prepared closely
resembles human milk in appearance, and its casein is so digested that
it is either not precipitated by acids or is precipitated, like that of
human milk, in flakes.By this process a digested or an easily-digested
casein is produced, instead of the casein of ordinary cow's milk, which
produces large and firm masses in the stomach--masses that the
digestive ferments penetrate with such difficulty that they cause
indigestion, and occur in the stools in coagula of greater or less
size.Pfeiffer pointed out that when peptonized milk is employed "the
feces showed absolutely no trace of the white cheesiness."Milk thus
prepared quickly spoils, and it is necessary to peptonize it in small
quantity and often during the twenty-four hours.In New York City during the last year peptonized milk has been employed
largely as recommended by Pfeiffer, and with such results as to
encourage its further use.It is now used in the New York Infant Asylum
and New York Foundling Asylum.Five grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild & Co.'s) and ten grains of sodium bicarbonate are added to
one gill of warm water.This is mixed with one pint of warm milk, and
the mixture, in some convenient vessel, is placed in water kept at a
temperature of 100 degrees F. for one hour, when it is placed upon ice
to prevent further digestion.It should be tasted frequently during the
peptonizing process, and if the least bitterness be observed the
process should be suspended before the expiration of the hour.With
some specimens of milk, especially at a temperature of 115 degrees to
120 degrees, a half hour or even less is sufficient.This artificial
digestion is arrested either by boiling the peptonized milk, which
destroys the ferment, or by reducing its temperature to near the
freezing-point, which renders it latent and inactive, but does not
destroy it.I need not add that placing the peptonized milk on ice is
preferable to boiling it, since we wish the ferment to continue to act
in the stomach of the infant.In the present state of our knowledge of
infant feeding, therefore, we can recommend no better substitute for
human milk than peptonized cow's milk.Leeds recommended the following formula for peptonizing milk in his
very instructive remarks made before the New York County Medical
Association, July 16, 1884.In order that no mistake might be made, I
wrote to him for his formula, which he kindly sent me.The following is
an extract from his letter: "The formula which I ventured to suggest
for the preparation of humanized cow's milk was as follows: 1 gill of
cow's milk, fresh and unskimmed; 1 gill of water; 2 tablespoonfuls of
rich cream; 200 grains of milk-sugar; 1-1/2 grains of extractum
pancreatis; 4 grains of sodium bicarbonate.Put this in a
nursing-bottle; place the bottle in water made so warm that the whole
hand cannot be held in it without pain longer than one minute.Keep the
milk at this temperature for exactly twenty minutes.The milk should be
prepared just before using."The object is of course to provide from cow's milk a food which will be
the nearest possible approximation to healthy human milk; and this
{753} appears to be achieved by the peptonizing process.Certainly,
what physicians have long been desiring--namely, some mode of preparing
cow's milk so that its casein will coagulate in flakes like that of
human milk--has been obtained by peptonizing.It is a common error to expect too much of a new remedy which has a
real value, and we must not expect that all patients not in an utterly
hopeless state will begin to improve as soon as peptonized milk is
prepared for them, or that it is a full and exact substitute for human
milk, so that wet-nurses may be dispensed with.Healthy human milk is
the best of all food for infants under the age of twelve months, and
should always be preferred when it can be obtained, but we claim that
peptonized milk is a most useful addition to the dietetic preparations
for infants, probably surpassing in value the best of those in the
shops.We employ it in the belief that it affords important aid in
curing the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Who first
formulated and recommended the process of peptonizing milk I am not
able to state, but I am informed that Roberts of Great Britain called
attention to it as a means of improving milk at a time antedating the
German conference.Milk from healthy, properly-fed cows may be prepared without
peptonizing, so as to agree with many infants except in the warmest
weather, but is obviously less easily digested than peptonized milk.It
should be diluted as follows with water boiled so as to free it from
germs: In the first week after birth one-fourth milk with the addition
of a little sugar.The milk should be gradually increased, so that it
is one-third by the end of the fourth week, one-half by the end of the
third month, and two-thirds to three-fourths by the end of the sixth
month.After the sixth month it is still proper to add one-fourth
water, but pure milk may be given.Before peptonizing--which, as we have seen, digests the casein to a
great extent, and changes that which is not digested so that it
coagulates in flakes in the stomach like breast-milk--was resorted to,
it was customary to use a thin barley- or oat-water in place of the
water used for diluting the milk.One heaped teaspoonful of barley
flour to two tablespoonfuls of water make a gruel of proper
consistence.A little farinaceous substance added to the milk by
mechanically separating the particles of casein tends to prevent their
coagulation in large and firm masses.This was the theory which
explained the beneficial action of the admixture.If for any reason
peptonized milk be not employed, milk prepared in the way I have
mentioned, by admixture with a farinaceous substance, is probably the
next best substitute for human milk.It is very important to determine when and how farinaceous foods shall
be given in this disease.It is well known that infants under the age
of three months digest starch with difficulty and only in small
quantity, since the salivary and pancreatic glands which secrete the
ferments which digest starch are almost rudimentary at that age.The
artificial digestion of starch is, however, easily accomplished.Among
the last labors of the renowned chemist Baron Liebig was the
preparation of a food for infants in which the starch is digested and
transformed into grape-sugar, and thus infants at any age who are fed
with it are relieved of the burden of digesting it.The baron led the
way which has been so successfully followed since in the artificial
digestion of foods.A considerable part of the starch {754} in wheat
flour is converted into grape-sugar by the prolonged action of heat.I
frequently recommend that from three to five pounds of wheat flour be
packed dry in a firm muslin bag, so as to form a ball, and be placed in
water sufficient to cover it constantly and the bag kept over the fire
three or four days.During the nights the fire may go out for a few
hours.At the expiration of this time the external part, which is wet,
being peeled off, the remainder resembles a lump of yellowish chalk.The flour grated from it gives a decided reaction of sugar by Fehling's
test.Starch is also quickly transformed into glucose by the action of
the diastase of malt, which indeed Liebig employed.If to a gruel of
barley flour, oatmeal, or other farinaceous substance, when hot, a
little of a good preparation of extract of malt, such as that prepared
by Trommer & Co.at Fremont, Ohio, which acts promptly, or by Reed &
Carnrick, be added, it becomes thinner.It is claimed that the starch
is thus quickly converted into glucose; which seems doubtful.It is,
however, so modified that it is apparently more readily digested and
assimilated.Farinaceous substances thus prepared may be employed with
peptonized or other milk.Infants frequently do better with this
admixture than when either the milk or gruel is used separately.Of the foods contained in the shops which have been most prescribed,
and which have apparently been useful in certain cases, I may mention
those which have been prepared according to Liebig's formula, of which
there are several, the analyses of which I have given, and Nestle's
farina.In the use of those foods which contain no milk, as Ridge's
food, Imperial granum, etc., it is recommended that milk be added,
while for such as contain condensed milk, as Nestle's and the
Anglo-Swiss food, only water should be employed.The Anglo-Swiss food
contains about 60 per cent.each
of oatmeal and Russian wheat flour.It gives an acid reaction, unlike
Nestle's, which is alkaline.When Biedert's cream conserve was
announced great expectations were awakened from the fact that the
inventor is an authority in paediatrics, but, unfortunately, they have
not been realized in this country.Much of Biedert's conserve when it
reaches us is spoiled, and the directions for its use are too
complicated for ordinary family use, since a different mixture is
required for each month of the infant's age.I have employed this food,
but, with Henoch, "could not convince myself that it is more
efficacious than cow's milk."I am informed that the sale of it in this
country has ceased.Condensed milk is largely used in the feeding of infants.The milk is
condensed in vacuo to one-third or one-fifth its volume, heated to 100
degrees C.to kill any fungus which it contains, and
38 to 40 per cent.of cane-sugar is added to preserve it.In the first
month one part of milk should be added to sixteen of water, and the
proportion of water should be gradually reduced as the infant becomes
older.The large amount of sugar which condensed milk, preserved in
cans, contains renders it unsuitable in the dietetic role of the summer
diarrhoea of infants.The sugar is apt to produce acid fermentation and
diarrhoea in hot weather.Borden's condensed milk, freshly prepared, as
dispensed from the wagons, contains, I am informed by the agent, no
cane-sugar or other foreign substance, and on this account is to be
preferred to that in the cans.It is cow's milk of good quality, from
which 75 to 79 per cent.of the water {755} has been removed under
vacuum.The sole advantage which it possesses--and it is an important
one--is that it resists fermentation longer than the ordinary milk.To select the best food for the infant from this considerable number of
dietetic preparations is one of the most important duties of the
physician.If called to an infant unfortunately deprived of wholesome
breast-milk, and suffering in consequence from indigestion and
diarrhoea, what diet shall we recommend?My recommendation would be as
follows: Use cow's milk of the best possible quality and peptonized in
the manner stated above, and peptonized in small quantity at a time,
such as a pint, or, better, half a pint.This may be the sole food till
the age of five or six months.Unfortunately, in the cities the milk
that is delivered in the morning is the milking of the preceding
evening, mixed with that of the preceding morning, brought often many
miles from the farms where it is produced.Milk twelve and twenty-four
hours old, notwithstanding the use of ice around the milk-cans, is apt
to undergo some fermentative change before it reaches the nursery.This
prevents the preparation of the best quality of peptonized milk, so
that in some instances during the heated term I have found that the
peptonized milk did not agree as well as the condensed milks, like
Borden's or Nestle's food.Not a few infants suffering from diarrhoeal
maladies seem to do better if some farinaceous food properly prepared
be added to the peptonized milk than when the milk is used alone.It is
better, I think, that the starch, or a considerable part of the starch,
be converted into glucose before the admixture.This can be done if a
few pounds of wheat flour be pressed dry in a bag, so as to form a
ball, and boiled three or four days, as I have elsewhere recommended.The flour grated from the mass gives a decided sugar reaction to
Fehling's test.For infants under the age of six months one
tablespoonful of the flour thus prepared should be mixed with twelve
tablespoonfuls of water and boiled.When it has been removed from the
fire and become tepid, a small quantity of a good extract of malt, as
Trommer's or Reed & Carnrick's, may advantageously be added to the
gruel to increase the transformation of starch and render it more
digestible.To avoid the time and trouble of preparing the food in this
manner, one of the foods contained in the shops, in which the starch
has been transformed into glucose by the employment of Baron Liebig's
formula, may be used, as Mellin's or Horlick's, instead of the wheat
flour prepared by long boiling.The older the child, the thicker should
be the gruel.Beef-, mutton-, or chicken-tea should not be employed, at least as it
is ordinarily made, since it is too laxative.Occasionally, for the
older infants, we may allow the expressed juice of beef, raw scraped
beef, or beef-tea prepared by adding half a pound of lean beef, finely
minced, to one pint of cold water, and after allowing it to stand for
half an hour warming it to a temperature not exceeding 110 degrees for
another half hour.Salt
should be added to it, and I am in the habit of adding to it also about
seven drops of dilute muriatic acid to facilitate its digestion.It is
chiefly for infants over the age of ten months that the meat-juices are
proper.A concentrated nutriment, prepared, it is stated, from beef,
mutton, and fruits, has lately been introduced in the shops under the
name Murdoch's Liquid Food.Young {756} infants with dyspeptic and
diarrhoeal symptoms can take it, and it appears to be readily
assimilated, as the quantity given at each feeding is small.It has its
advocates, and it appears to be of some service in cases of weak and
irritable stomach.But since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea of infants is foul air, it is obvious that measures should be
employed to render the atmosphere in which the infant lives as free as
possible from noxious effluvia.Cleanliness of the person, of the
bedding, and of the house in which the patient resides, the prompt
removal of all refuse animal or vegetable matter, whether within or
around the premises, and allowing the infant to remain a considerable
part of the day in shaded localities where the air is pure, as in the
parks or suburbs of the city, are important measures.In New York great
benefit has resulted from the floating hospital which every second day
during the heated term carries a thousand sick children from the
stifling air of the tenement-houses down the bay and out to the fresh
air of the ocean.But it is difficult to obtain an atmosphere that is entirely pure in a
large city with its many sources of insalubrity; and all physicians of
experience agree in the propriety of sending infants affected with the
summer diarrhoea to localities in the country which are free from
malaria and sparsely inhabited, in order that they may obtain the
benefits of a purer air.Many are the instances each summer in New York
City of infants removed to the country with intestinal inflammation,
with features haggard and shrunken, with limbs shrivelled and the skin
lying in folds, too weak to raise, or at least hold, their heads from
the pillow, vomiting nearly all the nutriment taken, stools frequent
and thin, resulting in great part from molecular disintegration of the
tissues--presenting, indeed, an appearance seldom observed in any other
disease except in the last stages of phthisis--and returning in late
autumn with the cheerfulness, vigor, and rotundity of health.The
localities usually preferred by the physicians of this city are the
elevated portions of New Jersey and Northern Pennsylvania, the
Highlands of the Hudson, the central and northern parts of New York
State, and Northern New England.Taken to a salubrious locality and
properly fed, the infant soon begins to improve if the disease be still
recent, unless it be exceptionally severe.If the disease have
continued several weeks at the time of the removal, little benefit may
be observed from the country residence until two or more weeks have
elapsed.An infant weakened and wasted by the summer diarrhoea, removed to a
cool locality in the country, should be warmly dressed and kept indoor
when the heavy night dew is falling.Patients sometimes become worse
from injudicious exposure of this kind, the intestinal catarrh from
which they are suffering being aggravated by taking cold, and perhaps
rendered dysenteric.Sometimes parents, not noticing the immediate improvement which they
have been led to expect, return to the city without giving the country
fair trial, and the life of the infant is then, as a rule, sacrificed.Returned to the foul air of the city while the weather is still warm,
it sinks rapidly from an aggravation of the malady.Occasionally, the
change from one rural locality to another, like the change from one
wet-nurse to another, has a salutary effect.The infant, although it
{757} has recovered, should not be brought back while the weather is
still warm.One attack of the disease does not diminish, but increases,
the liability to a second seizure.Medicinal Treatment.--The summer diarrhoea of infants requires, to some
extent, different treatment in its early and later stages.We have seen
that acids, especially the lactic and butyric, the results of faulty
digestion, are produced abundantly, causing acid stools.In a few days
the inflammatory irritation of the mucous follicles causes such an
exaggerated secretion of mucus which is alkaline that the acid is
nearly or quite neutralized.In the commencement of the attack these
acid and irritating products should be as quickly as possible
neutralized, while we endeavor to prevent their production by improving
the diet and assisting the digestion.In the second stage, when the
fecal matter is less acid and irritating from the large admixture of
mucus, medicines are required to improve digestion and check the
diarrhoea, while the indication for antacids is less urgent.Therefore
it is convenient to consider separately the treatment which is proper
in the commencement or first stage, and that which is required in the
subsequent course of the disease.First stage, or during the first three or four days, perhaps the first
week.--Occasionally, it is proper to commence the treatment by the
employment of some gentle purgative, especially when the disease begins
abruptly after the use of indigestible and irritating food.A single
dose of castor oil or syrup of rhubarb, or the two mixed, will remove
the irritating substance, and afterward opiates or the remedies
designed to control the disease can be more successfully employed.Ordinarily, such preliminary treatment is not required.Diarrhoea has
generally continued a few days when the physician is summoned, and no
irritating substance remains save the acid which is so abundantly
generated in the intestines in this disease, and which we have the
means of removing without purgation.The same general plan of medicinal treatment is appropriate for the
summer diarrhoea of infants as for diarrhoea from other causes; but the
acid fermentation commonly present indicates the need of antacids,
which should be employed in most of the mixtures used in the first
stage as long as the stools have a decidedly acid reaction.Those who accept the theory that this disease is produced by
micro-organisms which lodge on the gastro-intestinal surface and
produce diarrhoea by their irritating effect are naturally led to
employ antiseptic remedies.Guaita administered for this purpose sodium
benzoate.One drachm or a drachm and a half dissolved in three ounces
of water were administered in twenty-four hours with, it is stated,
good results.[3] I have no experience in the use of antiseptic
remedies.If by the appearance of the stools or the substance ejected from the
stomach, or by the usual test of litmus-paper, the presence of an acid
in an irritating quantity be ascertained or suspected, lime-water or a
little sodium bicarbonate may be added to the food.The creta
praeparata of the Pharmacopoeia administered every two hours, or, which
is more convenient, the mistura cretae, is a useful antacid for such a
case.By the alkalies alone,
aided by the judicious use of stimulants, the disease is sometimes
arrested, but, unless {758} circumstances are favorable and the case be
mild, other remedies are required.Opium has long been used, and it retains its place as one of the
important remedies in this disease.For the treatment of a young infant
paregoric is a convenient opiate preparation.For the age of one to two
months the dose is from three to five drops; for the age of six months,
twelve drops, repeated every three hours or at longer intervals
according to the state of the patient.After the age of six months the
stronger preparations of opium are more commonly used.The tinctura
opii deodorata or Squibb's liquor opii compositus may be given in doses
of one drop at the age of one year.Dover's powder in doses of
three-fourths of a grain, or the pulvis cretae comp.cum opio in
three-grain doses every third hour, may be given to an infant of one
year.Opium is, however, in general best given in mixtures which will be
mentioned hereafter.It quiets the action of the intestines and
diminishes the number of the evacuations.It is contraindicated or
should be used with caution if cerebral symptoms are present.Sometimes
in the commencement of the disease, when it begins abruptly from some
error in diet, with high temperature, drowsiness, twitching of the
limbs--symptoms which threaten eclampsia--opiates should be given
cautiously before free evacuations occur from the bowels and the
offending substance is expelled.Under such circumstances a few doses
of the bromide of potassium are preferable.In the advanced stage of
the disease also, when symptoms of spurious hydrocephalus occur, opium
should be withheld or cautiously administered, since it might tend to
increase the fatal stupor in which severe cases are apt to terminate.The vegetable astringents, although they have been largely employed in
the treatment of this as well as other forms of infantile diarrhoea,
are, I think, much less frequently prescribed than formerly.I have
entirely discarded them, since they are apt to be vomited and have not
proved efficient in my practice.As a substitute for them the
subnitrate of bismuth has come into use, and in much larger doses than
were formerly employed.While it aids in checking the diarrhoea, it is
an efficient antiemetic and antiseptic.It should be prescribed in ten
or twelve grains for an infant of twelve months; larger doses produce
no ill effect, for its action is almost entirely local and soothing to
the inflamed surface with which it comes in contact.It undergoes a
chemical change in the stomach and intestines, becoming black, being
converted into the bismuth sulphide, and it causes dark stools.Rarely
it gives rise in the infant to the well-known garlicky odor, like that
occasionally observed in adult patients, and which Squibb thinks may be
due to tellurium accidentally associated with the bismuth in its
natural state.For those cases in which the symptoms are chiefly due to
colitis, and the stools contain blood with a large proportion of mucus,
it has been customary to prescribe laudanum or some other form of opium
with castor oil.I prefer, however, the bismuth and opium for such
cases as are more decidedly dysenteric, as well as for cases of the
usual form of intestinal catarrh.In ordering bismuth in these large
doses it is important that a pure article be dispensed.The following are convenient and useful formulae for a child of one
year: {759}

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidrachm xiv.Shake thoroughly and give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Aq.cinnamomi,        fluidounce iss.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.X. Dose, one powder every three hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.Cholera infantum requires similar treatment to that which is proper for
the ordinary form of the summer diarrhoea, but there is no disease,
unless it is pseudo-membranous croup, in which early and appropriate
treatment is more urgently required, since the tendency is to rapid
sinking and death.As early as possible, therefore, proper instructions
should be given in regard to the feeding, and for an infant between the
ages of eight and twelve months either one of the above prescriptions
should be given or the following:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Spts.fluidrachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidounce iss.Give one teaspoonful every two or three hours.An infant of six months can take one-half the dose, and one of three or
four months one-third or one-fourth the dose, of either of the above
mixtures.If cerebral symptoms appear, as rolling the head, drowsiness, etc., I
usually write the prescription without the opiate; and with this
omission it may be given more frequently if the case require it, while
the opiate prescribed alone or with bromide of potassium is given
guardedly and at longer intervals.Although every day during the summer
months I have written the above prescriptions, it has been several
years since any case has occurred in my practice which led me to regret
the use of the opiate; but it must not be forgotten that there is
danger in the summer complaint, and especially in cholera infantum, of
the sudden supervention of stupor, amounting even to coma, and ending
fatally.A few instances have come to my knowledge in which, when death
occurred in this way, the friends believed that the melancholy result
was hastened by the medicine.But injury to the patient in this respect
can only occur, in my opinion, through carelessness in not giving
proper attention to his condition.It is chiefly in advanced cases,
when the vital powers are beginning to fail, when the innervation is
deficient, and the cerebral circulation sluggish, that the use of
opiates may involve danger.Explicit and positive directions should
{760} be given to omit the opiate or give it less frequently whenever
the evacuations are checked wholly or partially and signs of stupor
appear.Second Stage.--The summer complaint in a large proportion of cases
begins in such a gradual way that the treatment which we are about to
recommend is proper in many instances at the first visit of the
physician, who is frequently not summoned till the attack has continued
one or two weeks.The alkaline treatment recommended above for the
diarrhoea in its commencement does not aid digestion sufficiently to
justify its continuance as the main remedy after the first few days.In
a large number of instances, however, one of the above alkaline
mixtures may be given with advantage midway between the nursings or
feedings, while those remedies, presently to be mentioned, which
facilitate digestion and assimilation are given at the time of the
reception of food.Some physicians of large experience, as Henoch of Berlin, recommend
small doses of calomel, as the twelfth or twentieth of a grain, three
or four times daily for infants with faulty digestion and diarrhoea.To
me, this seems an uncertain remedy, without sufficient indications for
its use, and I have therefore no experience with it.The following are
formulae which I employ in my own practice, and which have been
employed with apparent good results in the institutions of New York:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.(Hawley's or other good pepsin), drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,                            fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                             fluidrachm xiv.M.

Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful before each feeding or nursing to an
infant of one year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.minim xvj;
      Acid.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                fluidrachm xiv.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every three hours to a child of one
year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.drachm j-ij;
      Bismuth.One powder every three hours to a child of one
year; half a powder to one of six months.I have also obtained apparent benefit from lactopeptin, given as a
substitute for one of the above mixtures before each feeding or
nursing.In several instances which I recall to mind I have ordered as
much as could be placed on a ten-cent piece to be given every second or
third hour, while midway between the feedings in some instances of
considerable diarrhoea one of the mixtures of bismuth and chalk
recommended above was employed, and the result has been good.Enemata.--It will be recollected, from our remarks on the anatomical
characters, that inflammatory lesions are commonly present in the
entire length of the colon, and that at the sigmoid flexure, where acid
and irritating fecal matter is probably longest delayed in its passage
downward, the colitis is usually most severe.Aware of this fact, I was
{761} led to prescribe at my first visit a large clyster of warm water,
given with the fountain or Davidson's rubber syringe, especially in
cases in which the stools showed mucus or mucus tinged with blood.This, given with the lower part of the body raised a little above the
level of the shoulders, washes out the large intestine and has a
soothing effect upon its surface.The benzoate of sodium may be added
to the water for its antiseptic effect, as in the following formula:

  Rx.drachm j;
      Aquae,         pint j.  Misce.In occasional cases in which the stomach is very irritable, so that
medicines given by the mouth are in great part rejected, our reliance
must be largely on rectal medication, and especially on clysters
containing an opiate.Laudanum may be given in this manner with marked
benefit.It may be given mixed with a little starch-water, and the best
instrument for administering it is a small glass or gutta-percha
syringe, the nurse retaining the enema for a time by means of a
compress.Beck in his _Infant Therapeutics_ advises to give by the
clyster twice as much of the opiate as would be required by the mouth.A somewhat larger proportion may, however, be safely employed.The
following formula for a clyster has given me more satisfaction than any
other medicated enema which I have employed:

  Rx.iv;
      Bismuth.ss;
      Mucilag.acaciae,
      Aquae,         _aa_ fluidounce ij.One-quarter to one half of this should be given at a time, with the
addition of as much laudanum as is thought proper; and it should be
retained by the compress.It is especially useful when from the large
amount of mucus or mucus tinged with blood it is probable that the
descending colon is chiefly involved.Alcoholic stimulants are required almost from the commencement of the
disease, and they should be employed in all protracted cases.Whiskey
or brandy is the best of these stimulants, and it should be given in
small doses at intervals of two hours.I usually order three or four
drops for an infant of one month, and an additional drop or two drops
for each additional month.The stimulant is not only useful in
sustaining the vital powers, but it also aids in relieving the
irritability of the stomach and in preventing hypostasis in depending
portions of the lung and brain, which, as we have seen, is so frequent
in advanced cases.The vomiting which is so common a symptom in many cases greatly
increases the prostration, and should be immediately relieved if
possible.The following formulae will be found useful for it:

  Rx.drachm ij;
      Spts.fluidrachm ss-fluidrachm j;
      Syrupi,
      Aquae,          _aa_ fluidounce j.  Misce.Dose, one teaspoonful half-hourly or hourly if required,
made cold by a piece of ice.ij;
      Liquor.Dose, one teaspoonful, with a teaspoonful of milk (breast-milk if the
baby nurse), to be repeated according to the nausea.{762} Lime-water with an equal quantity of milk often relieves the
nausea when it is due to acids in the stomach, but it is rendered more
effectual in certain cases by the addition of carbolic acid, which
tends to check any fermentative process.Perhaps also some of the
recent antiseptic medicines introduced into our Pharmacopoeia, as the
benzoate of sodium, may be found useful for the vomiting.A minute dose
of tincture of ipecacuanha, as one-eighth of a drop in a teaspoonful of
ice-water, frequently repeated, has also been employed with alleged
benefit.Of these various antiemetics, my preference is for the bismuth in large
doses, with the aromatic spirits of ammonia, properly diluted, that the
ammonia do not irritate the stomach.Nevertheless, in certain patients
the nausea is very obstinate, and all these remedies fail.In such
cases absolute quiet of the infant on its back, the administration of
but little nutriment at a time, mustard over the epigastrium, and the
use of an occasional small piece of ice or the use of carbonic acid
water with ice in it, may relieve this symptom.In protracted cases, when the vital powers begin to fail, as indicated
by pallor, more or less emaciation, and loss of strength, the following
is the best tonic mixture with which I am acquainted.It aids in
restraining the diarrhoea, while it increases the appetite and
strength.It should not be prescribed until the inflammation has
assumed a subacute or chronic character:

  Rx.calumbae,     fluidrachm iij;
      Liq.ferri nitratis, minim xxvij;
      Syrupi,              fluidounce iij.Dose, one teaspoonful every three or four hours to an infant of one
year.{763}

(Sennertus); Scelotyrbe pituitosa (Perywinger); Mucositas intestinalis
colloides, Concretiones gelatiniformes intestinales (Laboulbene);
Tubular exudation-casts of the intestines (Hutchinson).DEFINITION.--The disease is a non-febrile affection, consisting in a
peculiar, and usually persistent, morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous membrane, marked by the periodical formation of viscous,
shreddy, or tubular exudates composed chiefly of mucin, on the
discharge of which temporary amelioration of the accompanying acute
digestive and nervous symptoms occurs.HISTORY.--Although no distinct and separate accounts of
pseudo-membranous enteritis occur in the medical writings of the
ancients, nor even in those dating up to the eighteenth century, yet
there may occasionally be detected in some of the descriptions of
certain pathological conditions grouped under such titles as colic,
passage of gall-stones, tenesmus, coeliac and pituitous affections,
diarrhoea, dysentery, etc., the peculiar features of the disease under
consideration.This confusion ruled up to a comparatively recent time.J. Mason Good,[1] writing in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, groups the disease as a species of diarrhoea--diarrhoea
tubularis--and remarks that he had "never hitherto seen this species
classified, and not often described, although it occurred frequently in
practice."[Footnote 1: _Study of Medicine_, 1822.]Aretaeus,[2] in the second century, in discussing the subject of
dysentery, speaks of alvine discharges sometimes occurring of a
substance of considerable length, in many respects not to be
distinguished from a sound piece of intestine, which he regarded as the
inner coating of the bowel.{764} This false interpretation of a fact
arose from the circumstance that the membranous exudate occasionally
assumes a tubular form, bearing the impress of the inner surface of the
bowel upon which it is formed, and was perpetuated up to a
comparatively recent period by successive authors.This error befell
Simpson,[3] Morgagni,[4] Lancisi, and Spindler;[5] the last of whom
describes the material discharged as worked up into a "materia alba,
longa, compacta."Bauer[6] under the title of "intestinal moles" describes in Haller's
_Disputations_ the discharges of this disease as "concreta fibrosa
quaedam pro parte pinguedine rara abducta, membranacea molarum ex utero
muliebri rejectarum formam accurate sistentia."[Footnote 6: "De Moles Intestinorum," _Disputationes ad Morborum_,
Dresdae, 1747, p.In the same volume Kaempf[7] discourses on this subject under the title
of "infarction of the intestinal vessels," and also in a separate
treatise[8] published somewhat later.In the latter he groups the
disease with others of a far different nature, their only point of
convergence being preternatural alvine discharges.[Footnote 7: _De Infarctu Vasorum Ventriculi_, Basiliae, 1751.][Footnote 8: _Abhandlungen von einer neuer methode der hartnackigsten
Krankheiten die ihren Sitz im unterleibe haben, zu heilen_, Leipzig,
1784.]Subsequent authors, as a rule, fell into the same error, and it was not
until 1818 that membranous enteritis was discriminated by Powell[9]
from that condition in which we recognize the presence of gall-stones.Since then more correct views have prevailed, and the disease has now a
recognized place in nosology.ETIOLOGY.--As in other diseases of obscure nature, so in this, there
has been much divergence of opinion as to its cause.The influence of age is striking, as it is rarely seen in childhood or
in persons who have passed the forty-fifth year.Of my own cases, the
youngest was forty, and the oldest fifty-four.Rilliet and Barthez[10]
state that membranous formations in the intestinal canal of children
are very rare; that they always occupy the summits of the folds, rarely
the intervals, of the mucous membrane; and that they are detached in
layers of greater or less extent.Heyfelder[11] has described similar exudations under the name of
enteritis exudatoria.[Footnote 10: _Traite clinique pratique des Maladies des Enfants_, t.
i. p.[Footnote 11: _Studien in Gabiete der Heilwissenschaft_, p.Sex exerts as marked an influence as age, as the immense preponderance
of cases occurs in females.In an analysis of 100 cases, 4 only
occurred in males, 2 of which were children.All of my cases were
women; with the exception of two cases occurring in males, the same
experience is reported by Powell and by Copeland.In regard to temperament, it is undoubted that the disease invades
nervous and hypochondriacal subjects oftener than others, but all
temperaments are liable in the presence of those enervative influences
that degrade physical health and impair nerve-power.All of my patients
belonged to the nervous type.Whitehead says that those of a phlegmatic
temperament, not easily excited into action, or persons deficient in
elasticity of fibre, compose all but a very small percentage of the
sufferers from this {765} complaint, and he had particularly noticed
that a large proportion of the women have light flaxen hair, fair
complexions, and white skins.The determinative causes, whatever they may be, occasion perversion of
nutrition and innervation of the gastro-intestinal canal, principally,
I believe, by their action upon the ganglionic nerves presiding over
those functions originating the peculiar exudatory phenomena of this
disease.This condition of the nervous system once established, local
irritation of any sort may precipitate an attack, and hence the
multitudinous influences that have been assigned as exercising a
causative agency, as exposure to wet and cold, coarse, bad food, fecal
impaction, and the abuse of cathartic medicines, as alleged by
Grantham,[12] who asserts that the use of mercury, conjoined with a too
frequent use of aperient agents, is the cause of the disease in every
case.[Footnote 12: _Facts and Observations in Med.and Surg._, 1849, p.Farr considered the irritation of the intestinal canal owing to a
parasitic growth of a confervoid type (oscillatoria).This view is
supported by no other authority than that of himself and Bennett, as
nothing of this sort is recorded as occurring in the discharges of
patients of other observers; certainly in mine there was no parasitic
development.The presence of it in their cases may then be fairly
regarded as accidental, or at least unessential.Habershon regarded ovarian diseases and painful menstruation in the
female, and prostatic diseases in the male, as exciting causes.SYMPTOMS.--The most characteristic symptoms disclosing the presence of
pseudo-membranous enteritis are those arising from derangements of the
digestive organs.They are, in the beginning, vague and irregular in
occurrence, or so over-veiled by associated disorders of the
genito-urinary and nervous systems that their nature and import often
escape recognition until, weeks, and even months, of fruitless
medication addressed to these secondary phenomena having been expended,
the disease assumes such severity and presents such a complex of
peculiar symptoms that it no longer eludes identification.The disease rarely starts as an acute affection; sometimes it is
subacute, but in the great majority of cases its course is chronic.Its
initiation is marked with symptoms of gastro-intestinal
disturbances--irregularity of the bowels, constipation and diarrhoea
alternately; and dyspeptic annoyance of one sort or another--capricious
appetite, nausea or vomiting, and pyrosis, usually increased by liquid
diet.In Dunhill's case there was almost daily vomiting of mucus and
pus streaked with blood, and occasionally pure blood.This prominence
of gastric derangement supplies an explanation why Todd conferred upon
the disease the title of follicular dyspepsia.There is a sense of discomfort, soreness, or rawness of the abdomen,
especially along the line of the colon, and in two of my cases the
rectum was tender and raw, which augmented to decided pain in sitting
or riding, and the abdominal muscles were tense; a feeling of heat or
burning in the bowels often occurs, and almost always more or less
lassitude and mental depression.These symptoms aggravate, especially
upon indiscretions in diet, exposure to wet, or indeed under any sort
of enervative influences, at irregular intervals.Their persistence
finally induces grave disorders of nutrition, marked by the blood
becoming poor and thin, by sluggish {766} circulation and local
congestions in the pelvic and abdominal viscera, and loss of strength
and flesh.Yet certain patients seem to retain their flesh for a long
time, as I have seen, after suffering several years from the disease.The depression of vital powers is still further manifested in a small,
slow, soft pulse and a temperature running below the normal standard.The tongue is usually moist, pale, and flabby, and coated with a
pearl-white or yellowish-white coating; sometimes, however, it is raw,
red, tender, and fissured, or patchy from exfoliation of the mucous
coating.The gums and cheeks are usually pale and bloodless, and often
the seat of small roundish painful ulcers, which occasionally invade
the palate and throat.Grantham[13] says that ulceration of a
phagedaenic kind sometimes forms on the tonsils.The complexion usually
assumes a muddy or flavescent tint, which during the attack may deepen
to a jaundiced hue.At other times it presents a transparent or waxy
appearance.The skin is dry and furfy, sometimes cold and clammy, or, from
over-action of the sebaceous glands, greasy.There is a disposition,
especially on the chest, neck, and face, to papular eruptions or even
phlegmonous or carbuncular inflammation.The urine is high- and loaded with abundant phosphates, which in
cooling precipitate as a heavy deposit.The bladder is often irritable,
and discharges more or less mucus.According to Grantham,[14] patients
occasionally pass urine with evident traces of albumen, and seldom
containing a normal quantity of phosphates.On an increase in fever or
mental excitement a larger quantity than natural of the lithate of
ammonium is found; frequently the mucous membrane of the bladder is
found thickened in these cases.The characteristic symptom, however, of this disease is the periodical
formation and discharge of mucous exudates varying in physical
appearances and frequency.The discharge may occur daily, with every
stool, or at irregular intervals--a week, month, or longer--but usually
in from twelve to fifteen days.The recurrence may be precipitated by
irregularity in diet, exposure to wet and cold, or by excesses of any
sort.The paroxysm is marked by tormina or severe pain, which may
resemble that of colic or that of the passage of a biliary calculus,
extending down the thighs or to the bladder, in the latter case
sometimes causing retention, requiring the use of the catheter.The
pain is usually referred to some part of the large intestine.In
certain cases the paroxysm is announced by chills radiating from some
point in the abdomen or even from other parts of the body.After the paroxysm has endured two, three, or more days--usually a
week--membranous exudates, either with a spontaneous or with an
artificial movement of the bowels, are voided; after which there is a
gradual assuagement of the local and general symptoms, but the patient
experiences a sense of exhaustion or lassitude, and the tenderness of
the abdomen and the irregularity of the bowels usually persist.During the attack there is anorexia, but in the intervals the appetite
remains fairly good, and the alvine discharges may assume quite a
natural condition.In the course of the disease there is more or less disturbance in the
functions of the nervous system.During the paroxysm, when the {767}
sufferings are severe, the cast of symptoms running through the case is
of a decidedly hypochondriacal type.At times, with the expulsion of
the exudates and succeeding respite from suffering, there often occurs
a mental rebound which lifts the patient from the slough of despair to
the most hopeful anticipations of future health and happiness.In one
of my cases this transition was remarkable.This hysterical type is
common enough, and the irritability of the nervous system is still
further manifested in the occurrence of irregular contractions of
various groups of the voluntary muscles, as shown in hysterical
tetanus, general convulsions, or chorea in children, or by paralyses of
motion.Copeland[15] reports a case of a lady in whom this disease was
complicated with the severest symptoms of hysteria, occasionally
amounting to catalepsy.The paroxysms of pain recurred at intervals
between four and six weeks, followed or attended by the discharge of
large quantities of false membrane in pieces, and sometimes in perfect
tubes.The menstrual flow was painful and irregular, accompanied with
shreds of false membrane--not, however, contemporaneous with those of
the intestine.The sensory nerves are often deranged, for in some cases
there is paraesthesia--anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia--in limited areas
of the skin.There is more or less headache, neuralgic pains in this or
that nerve, or in several at the same time.[Footnote 15: _Dictionary of Medicine_, vol.The special senses do not escape; they manifest various forms of
functional derangement.In one of my cases there were constant buzzing
in the ears and perversion of the sense of smell, and in another the
vision was thought impaired and the services of an oculist sought.The uterine functions are always involved in greater or less degree.The menstruation is difficult and painful, and occasionally accompanied
with membranous discharges.In one of my cases there was a uterine
exudate, though the menopause had occurred several years before.Leucorrhoea and cervical inflammation are common.PATHOLOGY.--Despite the fact that the disease in question, without
being very frequent, is far from rare, little light has been shed upon
its pathology.Indeed, even its individuality as an independent and
distinct affection has been contested, although it is marked by a
complex of symptoms as peculiar and characteristic as those of any
other disease in the nosology.There are those who maintain that the disease consists essentially in
an inflammatory condition of the intestinal mucous membrane, either of
the ordinary or of some specific type, croupous or diphtheritic.Copeland says the formation of the membranes depends upon a latent and
prolonged state of inflammation extending along a very large portion,
sometimes the greater part, of the intestinal canal, as is evinced by
the quantity thrown off.Valleix[16] dismisses the subject summarily
with the delivery of the oracular judgment that the greater number of
cases of this disease are dysenteric, and the remainder diphtheritic.Habershon is in full accord with this view, having, as he says, seen
these membranous exudates "follow severe disease of the intestines of a
dysenteric character, and sometimes associated with a state of chronic
congestion of the liver, and often perpetuated by the presence of
hemorrhoids, polypoid {768} growths, etc."Wilks and Clark,[17] after a
full examination of the enteric exudates submitted to them, concluded
that they are true casts of the large intestines produced by chronic
inflammatory action of the mucous membrane and subsequent exudation.Conjectures have been ventured as to the exact anatomical structure in
which the process occurs.Thus, Todd[18] says that the proximate cause
of the disease is dependent upon a morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous follicles.Golding-Bird[19] holds similar language.He says: "It
is probable that the follicles are the principal seat of the disease,
for we know that they sometimes secrete a dense mucus differing little
in physical qualities from coagulated albumen or even fibrin."Livedey[20] attributed the process to a morbid secretion into the
mucous crypts.[Footnote 16: _Guide du Medecine practicien_, vol.[Footnote 18: _Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine_, vol.[Footnote 19: _Guy's Hospital Reports_.][Footnote 20: _L'Union medicale_, 1868.]Among those believing in its croupous nature was Powell, who assumed
the character of the inflammation to be specific, and the exudate of
the same nature and formed in the same manner as that of ordinary
croup.This was the view entertained by Cruveilhier and Trousseau and
other French authors.Good was misled in a similar manner, as shown by
his statement that the exudation bears a striking resemblance to the
fibrous exudation thrown forth from the trachea in croup.He says,
however, that it is discharged in longer, firmer, and more compact
tubes.Serres,[21] in a dissertation upon pseudo-membranous colitis,
confounds the exudate with that of thrush, muguet, and infective
dysentery.Laboulbene,[22] a later writer, also remarks that there are
found in many treatises and in periodical literature a great number of
occurrences of false membranes in the dejecta.Most of these cases are
referable to dysentery, to muguet, hydatids, etc., but there remain a
certain number which are owing to different inflammatory and
non-diphtheritic affections of the digestive tube.[Footnote 21: _These de Paris_, No.[Footnote 22: _Recherches cliniques et anatomiques sur les Affections
pseudo-membraneuse_, Paris, 1861.]Whitehead, in summing up his conclusions respecting the nature of the
disease, compares it with dermic inflammation.He says: "The mucous
membrane (intestinal), like the skin (and is not the one looked upon as
an inversion of the other?), is prone under certain conditions in
certain constitutions to develop products unnatural to its functions.It is not natural for the skin to produce eczema, neither is it natural
for mucous surfaces to produce mucus in a concrete form; that the
proximate cause of the symptoms referable to this disease is the
hypersecretion and accumulation of mucus on the free surface of mucous
membranes; such accumulations sheathe and prevent the healthy
performance of the functions natural to the part, and thus induce
immediate and remote results, the effect of such suppressed functions;
that this hypersecretion indicates a want of balance between
nerve-force and germinal matter, and that the nerve-force is perverted
by irritation."Simpson held similar views, and regarded the disease as a chronic
pellicular or eruptive inflammation of the mucous lining of the
bowels.[23] Other observers have been inclined to ignore the
inflammatory nature of the disease, at least as a primary condition,
and have sought the proximate cause in some as yet undefined
derangement of the nervous {769} system.Thus, Clark does not regard
the membranous exudates as the products of inflammation, properly so
called--that is, of capillary blood-stasis which has preceded their
formation--as the characteristic of such exudates is that they contain
fibrin.He says the abnormal cell-forms present arise in some other way
than by free cell-development out of an exuded blastema.Good[24]
asserts its dependence upon what he calls a "peculiar irritability of
the villous membranes of the large intestines, which in consequence
secrete an effusion of coagulating fibrin--fibrin mixed with
albumen--instead of secreting mucus, occasionally accompanied with some
degree of chronic inflammation."[Footnote 24: _Study of Medicine_, _op.cit._]

Also, DaCosta doubts whether the disease is originally inflammatory at
all."Where inflammation," he says, "occurs, is it not secondary rather
than primary, the result rather than the cause?""Is not the true
trouble in the nervous system, in the nerves presiding over secretion
and nutrition in the abdominal viscera?"Bennett and Byford represent the opinions of a very small minority who
regard the disease as simply an expression of uterine derangement.MORBID ANATOMY.--As none of the cases coming under my observation
terminated fatally, no opportunity was offered to me of making personal
investigation into the anatomical changes occurring in membranous
enteritis.Such opportunities have been so rarely met with that,
indeed, it may be said that the nature of these changes is wholly
unknown.Simpson alludes to a case of phthisis in which the patient had passed
large quantities of "membranous crusts or tubes," and in which the
mucous membrane of the colon was covered with an immense number of
small spots of a clear white color, or vesicles, which, when punctured,
discharged a small quantity of clear fluid; and also refers to the case
of Wright, in which the mucous membrane of the colon and of the lower
portion of the small intestine was studded everywhere with a
thickly-set papular eruption.My endoscopic examinations revealed, in the living subject, the
intestinal mucous membrane of a red, verging into a scarlet color,
thickened, and denuded of epithelium in patches of varying extent.This
condition does not always invade the ampulla of the rectum, but with
the long tube I am in the habit of using it was possible in all my
cases to reach a point where it existed.The extent of diseased surface
can only be conjectured by an inspection of the exudates and by
abdominal palpation.In most cases the exudate is restricted to the large intestines--colon
and rectum--and often to a circumscribed portion of them; but in rare
cases its length and quantity would seem to indicate that extensive
portions of the surface are covered.One of the most remarkable cases
recorded is that of a woman forty years old who had been sick for five
years with gastro-intestinal derangement.Suddenly the case became
acute, and after much suffering she passed membranous exudates three
millimeters in thickness and many centimeters long, weighing in all
three kilograms.[25]

[Footnote 25: _Recueil de Memoires de Medecine, de Chirurgie, et de
Pharmacie militaires_, tome xxxvii.Kaempf[26] gives another case, in which the length of the membranes
{770} discharged was sevenfold greater than the stature of the patient.In Dunhill's[27] case the patient had suffered from this disease for a
long period, and during two years passed many yards of perfect
cylindrical shape, many of them several feet in length, and
sufficiently coherent to permit of their being handled, held up, etc.In one of my cases a perfect cylinder three-quarters of a yard long was
voided.Laboulbene[28] describes the gastro-intestinal false membrane as thin,
soft, and granular, of a more or less yellow color, slightly adherent
to the mucous membrane, and when stripped off forming a yellow
pultaceous mass.He says it is first deposited in small, irregular,
sparsely-scattered patches, located on the summits of the intestinal
folds; afterward these patches increase, and cover the folds entirely
and almost the whole calibre of the intestinal canal.The mucous
membrane, he remarks, beneath the deposit is greatly inflamed.Powell believes that at times the deposit extends as high as the
duodenum, his opinion being solely based upon the clinical features of
the disease.In the first of his cases the membrane was found in
perfect tubes, some of them full half a yard in length, and certainly
sufficient in quantity, he says, to have lined the whole intestinal
canal.In examining the membranes it is always best to float them from the
fecal or other foreign material by passing the discharges in a clean
vessel containing water.Their physical characters can then be readily
studied.They are best preserved in a 10 per cent.The exudate consists usually of a single lamina, but at various points
in certain cases several superposed laminae may be observed, enclosing
between them particles of undigested food of various kinds.In most
cases the superficial layers are more opaque, drier, less elastic, and
friable than the deeper.The configuration of the exudate varies greatly.The more common
variety is that occurring in loose, transparent, jelly-like masses,
like the white of an egg or glue, tinged often with various hues of
yellow.In three of my cases I noticed also the frequent occurrence of
a thin, serous, yellow discharge.In some cases the discharge resembles
pieces of macaroni, tallow, or wax; in others it assumes a shreddy or
ribbon-like form; and in a still rarer class it is tubular, being an
exact reprint of the surfaces from which detached.These tubular pieces
are, however, more or less torn and broken into smaller fragments of an
inch or two in length when discharged.Its thickness also varies: sometimes it does not exceed that of the
thinnest film, and at others it is a quarter of an inch or more.Its consistence ranges from that degree of loose aggregation that
permits elongation into stringy, breaking masses when fished up from
the water in which it floats, to a firmness and tenacity that will
enable it to be handled without fear of breakage.It is usually yellowish-white,
but this is often modified by tints dependent upon admixture with
extraneous matters from the intestinal canal--biliary coloring, blood
from the rupture of the vessels beneath the exudate, or with blood and
pus.The surfaces of the membranes are ordinarily smooth and uniform, but
sometimes reticulated.Certain observers have described the outer {771}
surface of the tubular exudate as uniformly smooth, and the inner as
broken and flaky at some points, at others ragged and flocculent, and
in many places thrown into shallow folds, lying in some situations
across, but chiefly along, the axis of the gut.The microscopic characters of the exudate are pretty uniform.Wilks and
Clark[29] describe the surface of the tubes, examined with a linear
magnifying power of forty diameters, as exhibiting the appearance of a
gelatinous membraniform matrix traversed by a coarse network of opaque
yellow lines, studded at their points of intersection by similarly
 rounded masses.From the larger network proceeds a smaller
secondary network, and in the recesses of this were found, at close and
regular intervals, well-defined round or oval openings, with elevated
margins, resembling in size and appearance the mouths of the follicles
of the great gut.With higher powers the exudate was found in many
cases to consist of a structureless basement membrane, which in certain
points showed a fibrous appearance, owing doubtless to the presence of
filaments of mucin.Numerous irregular granular cells, as well as
granules from the breaking up of these cells, thickly studded the
surface of the membrane.In the specimens of Wilks and Clark the
surface, besides being marked by the opaque yellow lines and dots,
presented various foreign matters, such as bile-pigment, earthy and
fatty granules, portions of husks of seed, gritty tissues of a pear, a
peculiar form of elastic tissue, stellate vegetable hairs, and a
mucedinous fungus.Clark, in describing the fibres found between the
layers of the exudates, says that they exhibited a very distinct and
regular transverse striation, approaching in character that found in
the ligamentum nuchae of the giraffe.Quekett and Brooke have met with
the same fibres in the feces.The transverse division depends probably
upon beginning decay.The division is sometimes so distinct and
complete as to lead, according to Beale,[30] to their confounding with
confervoid growths.Farre[31] actually describes the formation as of a
confervoid character.[Footnote 30: _The Microscope in Medicine_, p.Here and there, in my specimens, were observed scattered epithelial
cells which were occasionally gathered in patches.Small <DW52> masses
of irregular shape, doubtless of fecal origin, were also noticed.The
cells imbedded in the matrix, according to the above-quoted observers,
consisted of two kinds--one more or less spherical, the other more or
less cylindrical.In size the spherical cells varied from 1/2000 to
1/800 of an inch in diameter.The smaller cells had no distinct
cell-walls.Some of the larger cells were filled with fat-granules, and
represented granular cells; others had a single or double vesicular
nucleus; a few were acuminated at two opposite points and somewhat
compressed.All the other cells possessed demonstrable cell-walls.The
cylindrical cells resembled in their general characters those which
normally coat the mucous membrane of the larger gut, but they were much
more elongated, compressed, and firmly matted together.Many of the
more elongated cells were constricted in the middle, and exhibited a
nucleus on each side of the constriction.The more or less spherical
cells occupied the attached, and the cylindrical cells the free,
surface of the membranous tubes.The perforations in the matrix were of uniform size and appearance,
{772} surrounded by elevated margins formed of closely-grouped
cylindrical cells, and led to two kinds of pits--one short and
flask-shaped, the other long and uniformly cylindrical.The
flask-shaped pits were about one-tenth of an inch in diameter and
distinctly hollow.The wall of each pit was made up of one or two
layers of subspheroidal cells, held together by an amorphous stroma.A
few of these follicles contained a deposit which was opaque in situ,
and which when broken up was found to consist of large flattened
nuclear cells, analogous to those met with in epithelial growths.The cylindrical pits were also for the most part hollow, about
one-sixteenth of a line in length and one-thirty-first of a line in
breadth.These walls, devoid of membrane, were composed of small, more
or less spherical cells in various stages of development, imbedded in a
gelatinous matrix.In examining the chemical characters of the specimens obtained in my
cases the membranes were thoroughly washed, when they were nearly as
colorless as the water in which they floated.They were drained on a
sieve, and presented a gelatinous appearance, much like the white of an
egg.Their specific gravity was about that of distilled water.When
treated with strong alcohol, the membranes shrank and assumed a
striated appearance.Chemical tests of tincture of guaiacum, peroxide
of hydrogen, and others failed to show the presence of fibrin or
albumen.Treated with ether, globules of fatty matter were obtained,
which were identified by their microscopical characters and by their
reaction with osmic acid.By boiling the liquid in which the membranes
had been soaked it became faintly hazy, indicating a trace only of
albumen.Faint evidence of the presence of this body was also presented
by picric acid and Mehu's test.John went back to the bathroom.Treated with a weak solution of caustic
potassa and heat, the membrane dissolved, leaving a little haziness.The liquid was then filtered, and exactly neutralized with acetic acid,
and plumbic acetate added, when a copious precipitate was formed.Mercuric chloride and potassic ferrocyanide failed to produce this
effect.From these and other tests used the conclusion was reached that
these membranes were composed essentially of mucin.Both the microscopical and chemical characters of the exudates of the
disease under consideration show that they are widely different in
nature from those of other diseases.They are evidently a production of
the muciparous glands (follicles of Lieberkuhn) of the intestinal
canal, and consist essentially of mucin.Perroud[32] concluded from his
analysis that they contain a small quantity of albumen, but are
principally formed of the same substance as that which enters into the
composition of the epidermis.The exudates of other diseases of the
alimentary mucous membrane contain albumen and fibrin, as well as
molecular or homogeneous filaments.The ordinary croupous exudate,
according to Cornil and Ranvier, always contains filaments of fibrin,
sometimes mucin and pus-corpuscles mingled with the cellular
constituents, which vary in character with the locality of the
inflammation.The filaments form a reticulum in the meshes of which are
contained the other elements.[Footnote 32: _Journal de Medecine de Lyon_, 1864.]Diphtheritic exudates, as shown by Lehmann,[33] consist of fibrin, a
large {773} quantity of fatty matter, and 4 per cent.of earthy
phosphates, while its structure is made up of epithelial cells united
together, which, becoming infiltrated with an albuminous substance and
gradually losing their nuclei and walls, are finally converted into
homogeneous branching masses.The cells of these masses are liable to
undergo fibrinous degeneration.The inflammation determining the
exudate is not confined to the conglomerate glands, but involves all
the textural elements of the part affected, and the material of the
membrane originates from the capillary disturbance in them.[Footnote 33: _Lehrbuch der Physiolog.Chemie_, Leipzig, 1855.]Andrew Clark[34] states that he has observed in his studies of exuded
blastema, the product of diseased action in mucous membranes, three
varieties.The first is clear, jelly-like, and imperfectly membranous.The second is yellowish, semi-opaque, flaky, and usually membranous.The third is yellowish-white, dense, opaque, distinctly membranous,
tough, and rather firmly adherent to the subjacent surface.The first
contains only the merest trace of albumen, and no fibrin; the second
contains an abundance of albumen, and no fibrin; the third contains
both albumen and fibrin in abundance, the latter in a fibrillated form.Yet it is to be noticed that in
the first variety there is no evidence of transudation or exudation; in
the second, no evidence of a true exudation; and that in the third, in
which the existence of a true inflammatory exudation is undeniable, the
only additional structural element present is fibre.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of membranous enteritis can never in its
advance, and rarely in its early stages, present much difficulty.Its
chronic course, irregular exacerbations, lack of febrile excitement,
the persistent derangement of the intestinal canal, the mental
depression, the gradual impairment of health, the various visceral
complications, and, lastly and chiefly, the peculiar character of the
alvine discharges,--stamp the disease with an individuality entirely
its own.The mucous discharges of certain forms of chronic diarrhoea and the
membranous discharges of infective dysentery are all so different in
physical character, and are associated with such a different complex of
general symptoms, that they cannot be confounded with those of the
diseases in question.The peculiar irritative quickness of the pulse of
ordinary enteritis, according to Powell and Good, suffices to
differentiate this disease from membranous enteritis.The peculiarities
of the physical and chemical properties of these exudates, already
fully dwelt upon, not only distinguish them from those of the above
diseases, but also from such dejecta as may contain fragments of
undigested connective tissue, of hydatids, or of worms.The flakes of
mucus discharged from the bowels in protracted constipation, fissura
ani, and in the later stages of cirrhosis of the liver are composed of
mucus in which are found imbedded epithelial cells from the colon and
mucus-corpuscles.The microscope will also reveal the character of the
fatty discharges that may be associated with diseases of the pancreas,
liver, and duodenum.The mucous flakes of cholera stools are composed
of masses of intestinal epithelium mixed with amorphous and granular
matter, crystals of different substances, and, according to Davaine, of
parasitic forms, particularly the Circomonas hominis.{774} Membranous casts from the upper part of the digestive track are,
in rare cases, passed by the bowels.One of the most curious instances
of this sort is reported by Villerme:[35] A woman swallowed a
tablespoonful of nitric acid, and seventy days afterward a long
membranous exudate, one or two lines thick and of a brown color, was
discharged, which corresponded in form with the oesophagus and stomach.[Footnote 35: _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, tome xxxii.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of the disease as regards life is not
unfavorable, but as regards permanent restoration to health and
strength the case is entirely different.Theden[36] and Hoffman[37]
have, however, stated that the disease is not an unfrequent cause of
sudden death.[Footnote 36: _Remarques et Experiences_, tome ii.]Abercrombie[38] records a case of death from phthisis complicated with
this disease, and Wright another case in which the patient died in an
extreme state of marasmus.The acute and subacute forms are more
amenable to treatment, and the chances are correspondingly greater of
permanent recovery, though in all cases there is a strong tendency to
relapse.The chronic forms may almost be enrolled among the opprobria
medicorum when once they have made deep inroads upon nutrition and the
vital powers, and produced that condition named by Todd the pituitous
cachexia (cachexia pituitosa).These cases may, however, be alleviated
by judicious treatment, diet, and climatic changes, but repeated
relapses may be expected as the rule under slight exciting causes or
even without apparent cause.Patients under these circumstances drag
out a life of valetudinarianism, but it may be cut short at any time by
the supervention of some intercurrent disease, as phthisis, renal
degeneration, etc., or, according to Grantham, atrophy of the
intestines.Broca[39] records two cases of this disease, one of which
lasted ten and the other fifteen years.Three of my cases have endured
over six years.[Footnote 39: _Bulletin de la Societe Anat.TREATMENT.--The treatment of membranous enteritis embraces medical and
hygienic measures.The medical means have for their object, first, the
removal of the membranous exudation when it has once formed; and,
second, to correct the conditions upon which its formation depends by
improving nutrition and invigorating the nervous system.The severe
sufferings of the paroxysms are greatly alleviated and the duration of
this stage cut short by freely emptying the bowels.The best means to
do this is by the injection of hot water with the long elastic bougie
three or four times a day, and to assist this with laxatives.Instead
of water, solutions of potassa, soda, and lime-water are preferred by
some practitioners.As a rule, the enemata cause considerable
discomfort, but in the end are followed by improvement in the condition
of the bowels.The best laxative is emulsion of castor oil, but
occasionally a mercurial, guarded by the extract of belladonna, will
furnish more marked relief.Powell and Copeland say that they have
employed with decided advantage a purgative consisting of the compound
infusion of gentian and infusion of senna, to which were added ten or
twenty minims of liquor potassae.This was repeated, so that four
stools in the twenty-four hours were obtained.Clark preferred to
regulate the bowels, when needed, with rhubarb, soda, and {775} ipecac,
conjoined or not, as required, with mercury and chalk.Good recommends
four grains of Plummer's pill every night, and the bowels kept open by
two drachms of sublimed sulphur daily.It should always be borne in
mind that all active or irritating purgatives are harmful.The bowels
by this treatment will not only be disembarrassed of the membranous
exudates, but also of any fecal collection the retention of which would
surely cause irritation, as occasionally happens even when there is an
apparent diarrhoea.This condition may be easily determined by
abdominal palpation.The relief from pain procured by free evacuation
of the intestine will be enhanced by the employment of hot fomentations
to the abdomen.Despite these means, its severity may, however, demand
the administration of narcotics.The best form will be a hypodermic
injection of a sixth or a quarter of a grain of morphia; enemata of
starch and laudanum are also beneficial.Burrows mentions a case in
which he succeeded in allaying nervous irritation by the nightly use of
thirty drops of laudanum.The patient noticed that the habitual
constipation was increased when the accustomed narcotic was omitted.Bromide of potassium in large doses long continued will also be found
useful for the same purpose.During the intervals of the paroxysms local medication of the bowels
and medical and hygienic measures should be had recourse to to prevent
the re-formation of the exudates by modifying the vital activities of
the intestinal mucous membrane and by restoring the general tone of the
constitutional powers.For local treatment the nitrate of silver,
sulphate of zinc, the sulphate of copper dissolved in glycerin, the
tincture of iodine, and carbolic acid cannot be over-prized.From five
to ten grains of the metallic salts, fifteen drops of tincture of
iodine, ten of the acid, administered through the long rubber tube, are
suitable doses to begin with.I am also in the habit of using stronger
solutions by mopping it on to the bowel through the endoscopic tube.Kaempf made frequent and large injections of decoctions of various
plants--saponaria, taraxacum, etc.--which he imagined possessed
dissolvent and resolvent virtues.Cumming[40] speaks highly of the
efficacy of electricity.Gazette_, 3d Series, vol.For the purpose of improving the general health the preparations of
iron are advisable, of which the best are the tincture of the chloride,
pernitrate, pyrophosphate, lactate, and potassio-tartrate.Habershon
advises infusions of the bitter tonics with hydrocyanic and
nitro-muriatic acid.I have found a combination of these acids with
henbane and infusion of serpentaria useful.I also employ hot solutions
of the latter acid as a local bath over the abdominal region, applied
with a large sponge.Clark speaks favorably of the extract of nux
vomica and astringent remedies.Simpson praises the oleo-resins under
the form of pitch pills and tar, while Clark and others laud copaiba
and turpentine.Good advises the copaiba to be given by enema when it
cannot be borne by the stomach.The alterative effects of small doses of arsenic, corrosive sublimate,
sulphate of copper, etc.Grantham in
the early stages of the complaint advises the use of ten grains of
iodide of potassium combined with one-quarter of a grain of morphia at

DYSENTERY.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.DEFINITION.--Dysentery is the clinical expression of a disease of the
large intestine, of specific and non-specific (catarrhal) origin and
form; characterized by hyperaemia, infiltration, and necrosis
(ulceration) of its mucous membrane; distinguished by discharges of
mucus, blood, pus, and tissue-debris; and attended with griping and
expulsive pains (tormina and tenesmus).ETYMOLOGY.--The name is compounded of the two Greek words [Greek: dys
enteron], which, though untranslatable literally into English, have
long since received the exact Latin equivalent, difficultas
intestinorum.With appropriate alteration the same name is still
employed in every civilized language in the common as well as the
classical description of the disease.The French synonym, colite,
locates the anatomical seat of the disease, while the German Ruhr and
the English flux express one of its cardinal symptoms, the frequency
(flow) of the evacuations.HISTORY.--Ancient.--In its clinical history dysentery is one of the
oldest known diseases, the name being found in common use before the
time of Hippocrates, as in the often-quoted passage from Herodotus (443
B.C.), who relates that it and the plague reduced the army of Xerxes on
the desert plains of Thessaly.Fayrer informs us that in the ancient system of Hindoo medicine of the
Ayur Veda, and in the commentaries of Dhanwantari, Charaka, and
Sussutra, which carry us back nearly three thousand years, and in later
Sanskrit writers, dysentery is described by the name of atisar, under
two forms--amapake, or acute, and pakistar, or chronic; these again are
subdivided into six varieties, ascribed by those ancient sages to
changes in air, bile, phlegm, food, or to perturbations of the emotions
and passions.makes frequent reference to the disease, the
nature of which he regards as a descent of the humors from the brain."Men of a phlegmatic temperament are liable to have dysenteries," he
says, "and women also, from the humidity of their bodies, the phlegm
descending downward from the brain.""The disease is caused," he says more exactly in another place, "by the
overflow of phlegm and bile to the veins of the belly, producing
ulceration and erosion of the intestine."In his country, at least, it
seemed most to prevail in spring, but it was clearly connected with the
heat and moisture of this season in Greece--prime factors everywhere in
the genesis of the disease: "For when suffocating heat sets in all of a
{778} sudden while the earth is moistened by the vernal showers and by
the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled from the earth, which
is thus soaked by the rain and heated by a burning sun, while at the
same time men's bellies are not in an orderly state, nor is the brain
properly dried."Of the prognosis he observes with great acumen,
"Dysenteries when they set in with fever... or with inflammation of
the liver and hypochondrium or of the stomach,... all these are bad.But such dysenteries as are of a beneficial nature and are attended
with blood and scrapings of the bowels cease on the seventh or
thirtieth day, or within that period.In such cases even a pregnant
woman may recover and not suffer abortion;" whereas, "dysentery if it
commence with black bile is mortal."Galen comments upon this statement
that such a discharge is as incurable as cancer.The practitioner of
our day will interpret this assertion, which was repeated with singular
unanimity by all the writers of antiquity, with the belief that the
black bile was blood, and that such cases really were cancers.Indeed,
Paulus AEgineta distinctly says, "Dysentery arising from black bile is
necessarily fatal, as indicating an ulcerated cancer."Thus, although dysentery is among the oldest of the known maladies, and
was recognized then as now by the same symptoms, the disease was by no
means closely defined or differentiated in ancient times.As Ackermann
long ago pointed out, many other affections were included under the
term dysentery, and some of the symptoms of true dysentery, notably the
tenesmus, were raised to the dignity of distinct diseases.The gravity of the so-called lotura carnea, the fleshy stools, was
fully appreciated by Hippocrates, as is evidenced by the remark that
"if in a person ill of dysentery substances resembling flesh be
discharged from the bowels, it is a mortal symptom."Fleshy masses,
[Greek: xysmata], scrapings of the guts (originally epidermic
exfoliations from the bodies of gladiators, used in pills as a tonic),
were frequently alluded to by the older writers, more especially by
Aretaeus, in description of the discharges of dysentery.Hippocrates
was also aware of the fact that dysentery may be a secondary as well as
a primary malady."One may expect," he says in speaking of the victims
of gangrene, "that such patients will be attacked with dysentery; for
dysentery usually supervenes in cases of mortification and of
hemorrhage from wounds."Finally, Hippocrates recognized the effects of
emesis in relief of the disease with the remark in one of his aphorisms
that a spontaneous vomiting cures dysentery.Celsus (25 B.C.-45 A.D.), the great encyclopaedist, whose works
"constitute the greatest literary monument since the days of
Hippocrates," compiles all the information obtained up to his time; but
it is plain as regards dysentery, though he defines it in terms that
might stand in a modern text-book, that he has nothing new to add to
the knowledge of the Hippocratic school.He named the disease from one
of its most prominent symptoms, tormina (tenesmus he considered a
separate affection), speaks of the stools as being mixed with mucus and
fleshy masses, and in its treatment especially enjoins rest, "as all
motion proves injurious to the ulcer."), of all the authors of antiquity, wrote the most
perfect and at the same time the most picturesque account of the morbid
anatomy and symptomatology of this disease.The gross appearance of the
ulcers in the intestine and the common character of the discharges he
{779} describes with the accuracy of the modern pathologist and the
ardor of the true clinician.He speaks of the superficial, the
deep-seated, the irritable, and the callous ulcer.There is, he says,
"another larger species of ulcers, with thick edges, rough, unequal,
callous, as we would call a knot of wood; these are difficult to cure,
for they do not readily cicatrize, and the cicatrices are easily
dissolved."Their tendency to arrest and renewal and their general and
local effects he notices at length."There may be a postponement of
their spreading for a long time," he says, "various changes taking
place in the ulcers, some subsiding and others swelling up like waves
in the sea.Such is the course of the ulcers; but if nature stand out
and the physician co-operate, the spreading may indeed be stopped, and
a fatal termination is not apprehended, but the intestines remain hard
and callous, and the recovery of such cases is protracted."Vivid
descriptions he gives of the stools: "Sometimes they are like chopped
tallow, sometimes merely mucus, prurient, small, round, pungent,
causing frequent dejections and a desire not without a pleasurable
sensation, but with very scanty evacuations."Again, they are "fetid
like a mortification;" composed of "food now undigested, as if only
masticated by voracious teeth,... the dejection being discharged with
much flatulence and noise; it has the appearance of being larger than
its actual amount."attempted to correct the pathology of his
contemporaries, who considered all bloody discharges dysenteric.There
are four distinct varieties of bloody stools, he claims, only one of
which, that due to ulceration of the intestine, deserves to be called
dysentery.The bilious stool he derived from melancholy, and the fleshy
stool from disease of the liver.But, though Galen regarded the
presence of blood as a necessity, he was well aware of the fact that
the stools contained ingredients other than blood.It was Galen who
first used the word scybala ([Greek: schybala], feces) to express the
small, solid masses of excrementitious matter often voided with the
stools.In his treatment of the disease he made much use of the various
drying earths, the Samian, Lemnian, Armenian, the sources of which he
made long journeys to visit in order to become better acquainted with
their properties, and which are better substituted in our day by
bismuth, chalk, magnesia, and the carbonate of iron.It is the
distinguished merit of Galen to have called special attention to the
anatomical seat of the disease.Ulceration of the intestine he claimed
as the very essence of the disease, and all the physicians of his day,
he maintained, regarded as dysenteric only such cases as are attended
with ulceration.Galen was the exponent of the flower of Grecian, we might say of
ancient, medicine.With very few exceptions, the later writers, if they
do not obscure the original text with their speculations, are content
to simply paraphrase the observations of their predecessors, and the
subsequent contributions to the ancient history of dysentery may be
briefly summed up in a few additional notes.Coelius Aurelianus (400 A.D.)adopted the humoralistic doctrine of
Hippocrates and regarded dysentery as an intestinal rheumatism
(catarrh) with ulceration.He seems to have been the first author to
recognize the cardinal fact that dysentery, notwithstanding the number
of its stools, should be classed with the diseases which constipate the
bowels, or, as it {780} was centuries later aptly put by Stoll, "ut
hanc morbis adnumeres alvum potius occludentibus," and he blames
Erasistratus for using nothing but astringents, whereas many cases of
dysentery require laxatives.It is worthy of note that Coelius
Aurelianus ascribes the first use of opium in the treatment of
dysentery to Diocles of Carystus (300 B.C.), who administered the juice
of poppies combined with galls.By the time of Galen opium was so
freely used in the treatment of the fluxes as to call for protest
against its abuse.Alexander of Tralles (575 A.D.)is often credited as having been the
first to locate the disease in the large intestine.The truth is, he
suggested various rules by which the seat of the disease, whether in
the small or large intestine, might be definitely determined.But none
of these rules--the seat of the pain, for instance, whether above or
below the umbilicus, and the interval of time between the pain and
discharges, whether long or short--possess the least diagnostic value
or add to the attempts in this direction of previous writers--Aretaeus,
Archigenes, and Galen.Like these, his predecessors, he recognized an
hepatic dysentery with discharges of bloody serum, which he attributed
with them to atony of the liver, but more boldly than they, and with
characteristic independence, he ventured to treat his patients with
fresh vegetables and fruits, damsons and grapes.Paul of AEgina (660 A.D.)locates the disease in the rectum, and gives
a graphic account of its symptomatology.He made the mistake of many
later practitioners in regarding as a separate disease a symptom,
tenesmus, which he describes as an irresistible desire of evacuation,
"discharging nothing but some bloody humor, which is the cause of the
whole complaint, being an oedematous inflammation of the rectum which
creates the impression of feces lodged in the intestine and a desire of
evacuation.""Dysentery," he continues, "is an ulceration of the
intestines, sometimes arising from the translation of tenesmus, and
sometimes being of itself the primary affection; and is attended with
evacuations at first bilious and of various colors, then accordingly
bloody, and at last ichorous, like that which runs from dead bodies."In curious contrast to these accurate observations is the absurd
suggestion of an obsolete therapy (Galen), that the dried dung of dogs
who had eaten bones, when drank in milk which has been curdled by
having heated pebbles put into it, is of great service; but as an
offset to this freak of fantasy is the renewed advocacy of warm milk,
fallen somewhat into disuse since the days of Hippocrates and Galen:
"And milk itself moderately boiled is an excellent thing"--a
recommendation of the milk diet which now plays such an important role
in the treatment of so many diseases of the alimentary canal.Modern.--From this brief survey it is seen that the writers of
antiquity left nothing in the symptomatology of dysentery for
subsequent authors to describe.All further advance in our knowledge of
this, as of all diseases, was now rendered impossible by the extinction
of the light of science in the long night of the Middle Ages, whose
gloom deepens with succeeding centuries and whose shadows fall close up
to our own times.The modern history of dysentery may be said to begin with Daniel
Sennertus, whose first _Tractatus de Dysenteria_ was published at {781}
Wittenberg in 1626.Sennert gave the deathblow to tenesmus as a
distinct disease, or as even a pathognomonic sign of dysentery, showing
that it is often present in purely local troubles, ulcers, fissures,
hemorrhoids, etc., or is due to disease of other organs--stone in the
bladder, tumors in the womb, etc.He recognized sporadic and epidemic
attacks of the disease, and described under the terms fiens and facta
forms which coarsely correspond to the catarrhal and diphtheritic
varieties of modern pathologists.Improper food, unripe fruits, at
least, cannot be the cause of dysentery, because, he shrewdly observes,
the epidemic of 1624 began in May, before the fruits were ripe, and
ceased in autumn, when they were ripe and in daily use.Moreover,
sucklings at the breast suffered with the disease.Nor could moisture
alone account for the disease, as this epidemic occurred after an
unusually hot and dry spring and early summer.Some other cause must be
invoked, and this other cause is perhaps the occult influence of the
constellations and planets--an explanation which he afterward admits to
be only an asylum of ignorance.In the treatment of the disease the
indication should be to heal the abraded or ulcerated intestine; but
since this cannot be done unless the cause is first removed, "the
abrading, eroding humor should be evacuated and absterged, at the same
time its acrimony mitigated and corrected; then the flux should be
checked by astringents, and the pain, if vehement, lenified and
removed."Purgatives should be repeated until all vicious humors are
discharged.Sydenham  his descriptions of the epidemic which he witnessed in
London in 1669-72 with the artistic touches of the master's hand."The
disease sets in," he says, "with chills and shivers.After these come
the heat of the fever, then gripings of the belly, and lastly stools.Occasionally there is no fever; in which case the gripes lead the way,
and the purging follows soon after.Great torment of the belly and
sinking of the intestines whenever motions are passed are constant; and
these motions are frequent as well as distressing, the bowels coming
down as they take place.They are always more slimy than stercoraceous,
feces being rarely present, and when present causing but little pain.With these slimy motions appear streaks of blood, though not always.Sometimes, indeed, there is no passage of any blood whatever from first
to last.Notwithstanding, provided that the motions be frequent, slimy,
and attended with griping, the disease is a true bloody flux or
dysentery."The efficacy of opium in its treatment causes him to break
out in praises of the great God who has vouchsafed us a remedy of so
much power.But Sydenham was too good a practitioner not to know that
all treatment must be prefaced with laxatives.For "after I had
diligently and maturely weighed in my mind," he says, "the various
symptoms which occur during this disease, I discovered that it was a
fever--a fever, indeed, of a kind of its own--turned inwardly upon the
bowels.By means of this fever the hot and acrid humors contained in
the mass of the blood, and irritating it accordingly, are deposited in
the aforesaid parts through the meseraic arteries."The indications
then were plain--viz."after revulsion by venesection to draw off the
acrid humors by purging."It was the frequent and successful practice
of Sydenham also to drench the patient with liquids, per os et per
rectum--a mode of treatment which both he and the learned Butler, who
accompanied the {782} English ambassador to Morocco, where dysentery
was always epidemic, hit upon, "neither of us borrowing our practice of
the other."Butler declared that the method of deluging the dysentery
by liquids was the best.But many attacks are cured almost on the
expectant plan alone.This was the case with the excellent and learned
Daniel Coxe, Doctor of Physic, in whom "the gripes and bloody motions
ceased after the fourth clyster.He was kept to his bed, limited to
milk diet; and this was all that was necessary in order to restore him
to perfect health."Zimmermann (1767) did not believe that improper food could be a cause
of dysentery, as in the epidemic of 1765 fresh grapes were plentifully
supplied to patients and proved an excellent remedy.He also noticed
the muscular pains (rheumatism) which had been mentioned by Sydenham
before him, and the paralyses first noticed by Fabricius in 1720, as
occurring in the course of, or as sequelae to, the disease.It was only
contagious, he thought, in bad cases, when the stools have a cadaveric
odor.But his main and most useful contributions were in the field of
therapy.He discarded venesection entirely, was among the first to
recognize the value of ipecacuanha, and objected strenuously to opium
until the cause of the evil was expelled.Hence he was vehemently
opposed to all astringents, to the use of which he ascribes the
rheumatisms and dropsies which sometimes occur.Wines and spices were
likewise put under ban; whey he permitted, but not milk, and water
freely, but always warm.Barley-water and cream of tartar were
sufficient food and medicine for ordinary cases, while camphor and
cinchona best sustain the strength in bad cases.Pringle (1772) observed the frequent occurrence of dysentery
coincidently with malarial fever, and was a firm believer in the
contagion of the disease.He claimed that the foul straw upon which the
soldiers slept became infectious, but maintained that the chief source
of infection were the privies "after they had received the dysenteric
excrements of those who first sicken."It is spread in tents and in
hospitals, and may be carried by bedding and clothing, as in the
plague, small-pox, and measles.Neither food nor drink propagates the
disease, he thinks, for, so far as the fruits are concerned, he too had
seen it prevail before the fruits were ripe.The first cause of the
disease is "a stoppage of the pores, checking the perspiration and
turning inward of the humors upon the bowels."Antimony was his
specific in its treatment.He was also fond of Dover's powder in its
relief, and preferred fomentations to opium, which "only palliates and
augments the cause."The best drink for patients with dysentery was
lime-water (one-third) and milk.This period of time is made memorable in the history of dysentery, as
of nearly all internal diseases, by the contributions from direct
observation upon the dead body by the father of pathological anatomy,
John Baptist Morgagni (1779).From the days of Hippocrates down, the
seat of the disease had been, as has been shown, pretty accurately
determined, and the same acumen which enabled the clinicians to
localize the affection had inspired them, as we have seen, to define
and describe its nature.But any descriptions from actual post-mortem
examinations were not put upon record until the beginning of the
sixteenth century, when were published the posthumous contributions of
Benivieni (1506-07).In his description of the lesions of the disease
he says that "the viscera displayed {783} internal erosion from which
sanies was continually discharged."Nearly three centuries elapsed
before Morgagni made his anatomical studies--an interval of time void
of any contributions from pathological anatomy; and so little attention
was paid to this branch of medical science that the descriptions of
Morgagni and of his more immediate successors failed to excite any
general interest or make any permanent impression.Morgagni himself,
while he fully recognized their significance, did not consider the
ulcerations of dysentery as absolutely essential to the disease, as
many cases, even fatal ones, did not exhibit them at all.They were not
liable to be mistaken for the lesions of typhoid fever, the ulceration
of Peyer's glands, because, though they may, they only rarely, coexist
in the same subject.As to the membranous fragments sometimes evacuated
with the discharges of dysentery, Morgagni showed that they are
occasionally true fragments or shreds of the intestinal coats, as has
been maintained by the older writers, Tulpius and Laucisius, but are
far more frequently nothing else than inspissated mucus--conceptions
which subsequent studies with the microscope have fully confirmed.In view of the general disregard of direct observations, it is
therefore not surprising to learn that the nature of the intestinal
lesions gradually fell into oblivion or at least became underrated in
its import.But it is a matter of surprise that Stoll (1780) was able
to declare as the result of autopsies made by himself that, although
the colon is thickened and inflamed, ulcerations in dysenteries are
very rare.This distinguished author did not at all believe in the
contagion of the disease, as he had never seen it attack physicians or
nurses.It developed, he thought with the older writers, as the result
of exposure to cold during a perspiration.He emphatically insisted
upon the frequency of rheumatism as complicating the disease, and
describes in proof a number of cases of painful swollen joints during
and subsequent to the attack.It was his especial merit to have
succeeded in dispensing with the acrid bile as a cause of the disease,
maintaining that hepatic derangements were only accidental
complications, and thus disposed, but only for a time, of bilious
dysentery in so far as it was supposed to depend upon defective or
abnormal action of the liver.But Annesley (1828) soon reinstated the liver in the pathology of
dysentery, with the exhibition of  plates displaying abscess of
the liver in connection with the disease, as well as illustrating the
displacements and constrictions of the colon which sometimes occur in
its course.The fourth decade of our century now brought in the anatomical
contributions of Cruveilhier and Rokitansky, to be followed later by
those of Virchow, upon which the modern morbid anatomy of the disease
is based; while the labors of the Indian physicians and of Copeland,
Parkes, and Vaidy put us in possession of the facts pertaining to its
general pathology.Fayrer has quite recently published the results of
his vast experience with dysentery in India, an important contribution
to the practical study of the disease, and Hirsch has treated
exhaustively of its medical geography.But the merit of publication of
the most complete chapter or work upon dysentery that has ever been
written anywhere belongs to, and is the especial pride of, our own
country.It constitutes the bulk of the second volume of the _Medical
and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion_.It is a veritable
encyclopaedia of knowledge, not {784} only upon the subject of which it
treats, but upon all subjects immediately or even remotely collateral
to it, and is a lasting monument to the labor and the learning of its
author, Joseph J. Woodward, Surgeon of the United States Army.GENERAL REMARKS.--Dysentery may be a primary or a secondary disease.As
a primary disease it occurs in sporadic, endemic (often closely,
sometimes curiously, circumscribed), or epidemic form, and is either
acute or chronic, according to the nature of its symptoms and lesions.The ancient types of sthenic and asthenic or adynamic, typhoid,
bilious, and malarial dysenteries belong rather to history than to
modern medicine.The classification of cases in general use at
present--viz.the catarrhal and croupous or diphtheritic forms--has
reference rather exclusively to the nature of the lesion, and is hence
extremely defective.Nor are the divisions (as in cholera) into
sporadic and epidemic forms much more satisfactory, in that they
indicate simply the range or extent of the disease, and by no means
define a separate array of symptoms or lesions; precisely the same
symptoms or lesions being encountered in individual cases of either
form.None of these divisions clearly indicate differences in etiology,
upon which factor alone can any acceptable division of cases be based.Perhaps less objection may be urged against the assumption of catarrhal
and specific forms, including under the provisional term catarrhal all
the cases which cannot as yet be accounted for by the action of a
special or specific cause.It will become apparent in the study of the etiology of dysentery that
while any of the factors invoked may suffice to produce the catarrhal
(sporadic) form, none will explain the specific (epidemic) form of the
disease; both forms may be alike in their lesion and signs, but they
differ widely in their cause.In other words, dysentery is only a
clinical, and is in no way an etiological, expression of a disease.In
this respect dysentery finds its analogue in a much grosser lesion of
the bowels--namely, occlusion, acute or chronic, which, while it
presents pretty much the same train of symptoms, may depend upon a
great variety of causes, as impaction, strangulation, intussusception,
etc.While any of the causes cited may be sufficient to excite the
catarrhal form of the disease, the same causes may stand to the
specific form only in the relation of predisposing agents.Or, as
Maclean has better put it, "It appears that many of the so-called
causes of dysentery must be regarded more as acute agents of
propagation than of causation."As a secondary disease dysentery occurs in the course of, or as a
sequel to (not infrequently as the terminal affection of), pyaemia and
septicaemia (puerperal fever), typhus and typhoid fevers, pneumonia,
Bright's disease, variola, scarlatina, abscess of the liver (though the
order of sequence is here oftener reversed), scorbutus, marasmus from
any cause, tuberculosis, and cancer.It must not be forgotten, however,
of these latter affections that each produces its own lesions in the
large intestine, which are not to be confounded with those of genuine
dysentery.The view that dysentery shows a periodicity of recurrence at certain
distinct intervals or cycles--three, five, or ten years--is entirely
without foundation in fact; but there is strong ground for believing
that the disease is gradually abating both in frequency and virulence
with improvements in sanitation and hygiene.Thus, Heberden shows that
the {785} number of deaths set down in the seventeenth century under
the titles of bloody flux and gripings of the guts was never less than
1000 annually, and in some years exceeded 4000, whereas during the last
century the number gradually dwindled down to 20 (Watson)--a number
which is certainly a misprint for 200; and Aitken states that as a
cause of death it has been decreasing since 1852.Geissler also
remarks[1] that the variation in epidemics is nowhere so well
illustrated as in the case of dysentery.A noticeable reduction in the
number of cases in England began about 1850, and has continued almost
without interruption to the present time, so that now (1880) six to
eight times less cases occur than in the forties.The same diminution
has been noticed in Bavaria and Sweden.In Sweden the cases treated by
physicians in 1857 numbered no less than 37,000, with over 10,000
deaths; whereas now the number is reduced to 400-500 a year, and the
mortality has experienced a corresponding reduction from 20-30 to 6-8
per cent.[Footnote 1: _Periodische Schwanderungen der wichtigsten Krankheiten_.]At the same time, it is known of dysentery that it sometimes shows an
almost freakish recurrence after long intervals of time, appearing in a
place for many decades free from the disease, to establish itself there
for years as a regular endemic malady, not to disappear again for a
long series of years; in which respect, Hirsch remarks, it much
resembles malaria.Allusion has been already made to the occasional curious
circumscription of the disease in definite localities.In fact,
dysentery, even when late to assume the proportions of a widespread
epidemic, begins, as a rule, and is confined for a time, in individual
enclosed regions--prisons, barracks, hospitals, etc.; and in the
process of dissemination it is rather characteristic of the disease to
leap over or to spare intervening territory and appear in new foci at
some distance from its original seat.A direct irradiation or linear
transmission of the disease is the exception, and not the rule.The
significance of this fact will become evident in the study of the
etiology of the disease.Dysentery is pre-eminently a disease of army life, its victims among
soldiers numbering more than all other diseases together.Sir James
MacGrigor, Medical Superintendent of the British army, called it the
scourge of armies and the most fatal of all their diseases.Aitken says
that "it has followed the tracks of all the great armies which have
traversed Europe during the continental wars of the past two hundred
years."It decimated the French, Prussian, and Austrian armies in 1792.In Cape Colony in 1804 every fourth man among the soldiers was attacked
with the disease, and of those attacked every fifth man died.In
Napoleon's campaign in Egypt dysentery numbered one-half more victims
than the plague; Kinglake says that 5000 men died of dysentery alone in
the war of the Crimea; and in our own country during our Civil War from
1861-65 chronic camp dysentery was the cause of more than one-fourth of
all the diseases reported, the mortality being at the rate of 12.36 per
1000.Woodward relates that the dysenteries, acute and chronic, with
diarrhoeas, made their appearance in the new regiments at the beginning
of the war, and, though mild at first, quickly assumed a formidable
character."Soon no army could move without leaving behind it a host of
the victims.They crowded the ambulance-trains, the railroad-cars, the
{786} steamboats.In the general hospitals they were often more
numerous than the sick from all other diseases, and rivalled the
wounded in multitude.They abounded in the convalescent camps, and
formed a large proportion of those discharged for disability."Most of
the prisoners died of this disease, and great numbers succumbed to it
on retirement to their homes after the cessation of the war.It is the
story of many a campaign, Eichhorst says, that dysentery kills more men
than the enemy's guns.The fact that it sometimes shows itself in periodic form or with
periodic exacerbation, that it is sometimes successfully treated with
quinia, and that, as has been noticed from the days of Hippocrates
down, it prevails in greatest intensity in malarial regions, has given
rise to the view that dysentery is a malarial disease.This view, which
was strongly advocated by many of the older writers, Senac, Fournier,
Annesley, met with renewed support at the hands of many of the surgeons
in our Civil War.But wider observation has shown the fallacy of such a
view; for not only may the diseases prevail entirely independently of
each other in malarial regions, but there are regions where one does
and the other does not exist.Thus Huebner quotes from Rollo concerning
St.Lucie (West Indies), a town situated on a mountain in the midst of
a swampy country in which both dysentery and malaria abound, while the
town itself is almost free from dysentery; and Dutrolan cites Reunion
as a place where marsh fevers do not occur, while dysentery is very
common.Berenger-Feraud[2] scouts the idea of any such connection.Pierre de la Martinique," he says, "where there is
not a piece of marsh as big as a hand, but where dysentery has made
great ravage more than once.We might cite also Mauritius, Gibraltar,
Malta, New Caledonia--places exempt, or almost exempt, from malaria,
but often visited by dysentery."[Footnote 2: _Traite theorique et clinique de la Dysenterie, etc._,
Paris, 1883.]The view that dysentery is a form of typhus or typhoid fever
(Eisenmann) or scurvy needs no refutation in the light of existing
knowledge regarding the pathogenesis and pathology of these affections.These diseases may often complicate, but can never cause, dysentery.Dysentery is a disease which spares no age, sex, or social condition,
the seeming greater suffering of the poorer classes being due to the
filth, food, darkness, dampness--in short, to the bad sanitation--of
poverty.Though the disease is often confined exclusively to soldiers in the
midst of a civil population, examples are not wanting of an exclusive
selection of civilians or of an indiscriminate attack in every
direction.Lastly, dysentery is a disease which may recur repeatedly in
the same individual, one attack rather predisposing to than preventing
another.ETIOLOGY.--Dysentery is an omnipresent disease."Wherever man is,"
Ayres observed of it nearly a quarter of a century ago, "there will
some of its forms appear."But the character of the form, and more
especially the extent and severity of the disease, vary in extreme
degree with the conditions surrounding the abode of man.No one of
these conditions affects the disease so markedly as the climate.It is
the testimony of Hirsch, based upon the study of seven hundred
epidemics of the disease, that no other disease is so dependent upon
the influence of the climate.The home of dysentery is the tropical
zone.It prevails in greatest frequency {787} and virulence in the
tropics, and in those regions of the tropics where the characteristics
of this zone are more pronounced, diminishes in intensity in the
temperate regions, and occurs only in sporadic form farther north.At
40 degrees latitude the line may be pretty sharply drawn; beyond it
dysentery as an epidemic is almost unknown.[3]

[Footnote 3: Shakespeare (_Troilus and Cressida_) cites "griping of the
guts" among the "rotten diseases of the south."]India has been from time immemorial the hotbed of this disease.Henderson says it is perhaps more fatal to natives than all other
diseases put together, and Hutchinson, Hunter, and Tytler observe that
it causes three-fourths of the deaths among the natives of Hindostan.In Egypt the disease is indigenous, and is, according to Frank, post
pestem maxime timendus.Greisinger reports that one-half of all the
autopsies made by him in Egypt showed dysentery as a primary or
secondary affection.It is epidemic here at all times, Roser says, and
all fatal cases of acute or chronic disease finally perish with it.Similar testimony might be adduced from a large part of Africa, much of
Asia, the Indian Archipelago, and the West Indies.It rages
"murderously" in Peru, causing a mortality in some epidemics of 60 to
80 per cent., and occurs in this country not only in the valleys, but
in cities and provinces at the lofty elevation of 8000 to 13,000 feet.Heat, moisture, vegetable decomposition, and sudden atmospheric change
are the distinguishing characteristics of southern climes, and the
study of the etiology of a disease incident or indigenous to these
conditions calls for an investigation of these various factors.It is well established of dysentery that it occurs for the most part in
the hottest season of the year.Of 546 epidemics tabulated by Hirsch,
404 prevailed in summer and fall, 113 in fall and winter, 16 in spring
and summer, and only 13 in winter.Fourteen-fifteenths of the whole
number of epidemics occurred in the months of June to September.And it
is corroborative of these conclusions that of 1500 deaths from
dysentery in the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Baltimore from 1816 to 1827, 1100 occurred in the months of July,
August, and September.In fact, the Census Reports (1860-70) of our
country show the maximum mortality in August and September, and the
minimum in January and February.The prevalence of unusual heat may also call out an epidemic in places
where the disease usually shows itself only in endemic or sporadic
form.Thus, the severe epidemic of 1540 in England was preceded by a
heat so intense as to dry up the wells and small streams, in
consequence of which many cattle died of thirst; and the epidemics of
1583 in Germany, of 1758 in France, and of 1847 in our own country,
were characterized in the same way.Interesting in this connection is
the statement of Frick concerning the epidemic in Baltimore in 1849,
who found the cases to increase and decrease almost in proportion to
the elevation and depression of temperature.The epidemic of Weimar in
1868, where 12,000 people fell ill with the disease, illustrated the
rule when it ceased suddenly on the approach of cool weather at the end
of August.But that heat alone is not sufficient to account for the genesis of the
disease is apparent from the occasional occurrence of it in the tropics
in the colder seasons of the year; in the colder climates, Russia,
Sweden, {788} and Canada; and in temperate regions during exceptionally
cool seasons, as in Plymouth in 1769, London in 1808, Massachusetts in
1817.Moreover, the temperate zone is often characterized by seasons of
unusual heat, during the prevalence of which dysentery may be almost
unknown.Thus, during the summer of 1881, in Cincinnati, the
thermometer scarcely fell below 95 degrees F. for weeks at a time, and
was often nearly 100 degrees during the entire night, but the records
at the Health Office show that while cases of heatstroke were
alarmingly frequent, dysentery was unusually rare during the entire
season.That moisture cannot act more, at most, than as an occasional
predisposing cause of dysentery is sufficiently clear from the
statement of Hirsch, that of 119 epidemics, 62 commenced or were
preceded by wet and 57 by dry weather.In truth, dryness long continued
and excessive heat have already been invoked as remote causes of the
disease.But moisture, as contributing to, or being a necessary element
of, vegetable decomposition, the third characteristic of tropical
regions, is entitled to further consideration.Annesley observed that
among troops stationed in the vicinity of rivers, canals, and places
abounding with emanations from the decay of animal and vegetable
matters dysentery became extremely prevalent and assumed a more or less
malignant nature; and Baly, who studied the disease in its famous
outbreak in the Milbank Penitentiary, remarks that "it is greatest at
those seasons and in those states of the atmosphere which most favor
decomposition of organic matter in the soil."In Africa it has been noticed that dysentery appears with the rainy
season, to disappear only at its close; and the same observation has
been made of Bengal, while in Lower Egypt the disease follows the
inundations of the Nile.Burkhardt says of 10,000 cases that one-half
occur in wet hot seasons, two-fifths in dry hot seasons, and but
one-tenth in cold seasons.Moreover, the removal of camping-grounds to
dry localities has often arrested the disease or checked its further
dissemination.Thus, Mursinna states that the removal of the army of
Prince Henry of Hesse from Nimes, where the disease raged fearfully, to
Leitmeritz was attended by its immediate cessation, notwithstanding the
fact that the soldiers ate large quantities of fruit.A statement of
Dillenius, quoted by Heubner, is in this connection exceedingly
instructive: "Dillenius had to march with a dysentery hospital of more
than 500 patients from July 26 to August 3, 1812, and it required four
whole days to accomplish an ordinary nine or ten hours' march.The
patients, extremely exhausted, were finally put into a sheep-shed.Here, in the fresh air and lying on hay, they all improved very
quickly.By advice of the physician they ate for medicine the fresh
whortleberries which they themselves had picked."Werneck attributes
the exemption of the city of Halle since the end of the last century to
the draining and drying of the neighboring marshes.On the other hand, numerous observations go to prove that dysentery is
likewise prevalent in dry sandy soils where the factors so necessary to
the production of malaria are entirely unknown.Thus, Hirsch quotes
from Harthill to the effect that dysentery never occurred among the
English troops in Afghanistan until they entered upon its thoroughly
dry and sandy plains; and from Lidell, who declared that the disease
prevailed most in Panama in March, the dry season at this place.Again,
a striking confirmation of exemption from dysentery in a marshy region
{789} is offered in the Antilles at Grande-Terre, "a wet, marshy plain
severely visited by malaria, but used by patients attacked with chronic
dysentery at Basse-Terre as the safest place of refuge and recovery."The role of moisture and vegetable decomposition may be, then, summed
up in the words of Annesley, that "all situations which furnish
exhalations from the decay of animal or vegetable productions under the
operation of a moist and hot state of the atmosphere will always
occasion dysentery in the predisposed subject--_circumstances which,
with other causes_ [italics ours], combine to generate the disease."Atmospheric vicissitudes, checking of perspiration, catching cold, are
synonyms in the present popular as in the ancient professional
conception of the genesis of dysentery."Of the remote causes of
dysentery," Johnson says, "I need say little; they are the same in all
parts of the world--atmospheric vicissitudes."And in making this
statement the author expresses the almost universal testimony of the
Indian physicians."Sudden change of temperature," observes
Kaputschinsky of the Trans-Caucasus, where dysentery is rife, "is in
this region no rarity.The sultry heat of noon often alternates with a
cutting cold wind, and vice versa.In the same place is now a warm, now
a cold, now a glowing hot breeze, and such changes most predispose to
dysentery."And McMullin says of the Barbadoes that "it is a curious
fact that this disease is most prevalent where from the immediate
contiguity of mountains sudden vicissitudes of temperature are
experienced."Didelot says also of South France, "It is not the fruits,
as people still believe to-day, which act as causes of dysentery, but
the sudden variations of the air."Ruthay remarks of the dysentery of
China that the most common cause is a chill caught by sleeping in a
draught uncovered or in the open air.Metzler attributes the exemption
of Stuttgart (since 1811) from any great epidemic to the fact that the
city lies in a valley open only to the east, which permits no contrast
of hot days and cold nights; and Seeger, in speaking of the epidemic
which occurred in Ludwigsberg in 1872 (a city of twelve thousand
population, where no epidemic of any kind had appeared since 1834, and
where 870 were suddenly attacked with dysentery) that it first broke
out in Kaffeeburg in two streets exposed to the wind, and thence spread
to different parts of the city.Exposure of the body, especially the
abdomen, during sleep or when perspiring, the sudden laying aside of
flannel body-clothes, are proceedings, Fayrer says, pregnant with
danger in dysenteric regions.A lamentable dysentery appeared,
according to Trotter, on board H.M.S.Berwick Oct., 1780, "in
consequence of the hurricane on the fifth of the month, by which the
clothes and bedding of the seamen, and indeed all parts of the ship,
were soaked in water, and many of the men slept for nights together on
the wet decks overcome with fatigue and debilitated from want of food."Fayrer also quotes from Moseley the observation that "it often happens
that hundreds of men in a camp have been seized with the dysentery
almost at the same time after one shower of rain or from lying one
night in the wet and cold."As illustrating the conjoined operation of all these various causes,
together with filth and foul effluvia, more especially exposure to
cold, the story of dysentery was never better told than by Sir James
MacGrigor, who, in speaking of the Peninsular campaign, remarks that
"the army during June as well as July was traversing Castile, where it
was {790} exposed to the direct influence of a burning sun darting its
rays through a sky without a single cloud, the troops marching and
fighting during the day, and bivouacking during the night on arid,
unsheltered plains.They felt at times every vicissitude of heat and
cold.In the rapid advance they could not be regularly supplied with
food or had not time to cook it, and not unfrequently indulged in bad
wine and unripe fruit."... The thousands of sick (chiefly from
diarrhoea, dysentery, and remittent fever) were hurried off to Ciudad
Rodrigo, the nearest hospital-station to the frontier of Portugal, a
town "composed chiefly of ruins with very narrow streets,"... and from
having been "so much the object of contest, and alternately the site of
the hospitals of all the contending armies, nearly twenty thousand
bodies were calculated to have been put into the earth either in the
town or under its walls in the course of a few months."... "It may
easily be conceived," the author adds, "in what state cases of
dysentery must have arrived after having sustained a journey in extent
from four to twenty days, conveyed chiefly in bullock-carts or on the
backs of mules, sometimes under incessant rain for several days
together."It is really quite superfluous to cite further opinions or examples in
illustration of a fact which is so universally conceded as to be
exaggerated in its general significance.Taking cold is the common idea
of the cause of dysentery, and is always a satisfactory explanation in
a case of obscure origin in this or any disease, even though the
patient may be able to recall no possible exposure.The physician
himself contents himself only too easily with resort to this refuge,
and with further appeal to the locus minoris resistentiae, as the
explanation of the seat of the disease, which he hopes to cure with the
aid of the vis medicatrix naturae.But taking cold is only a popular
paraphrase for contracting a disease, and will bear no scientific
analysis of its meaning.Mere reduction of temperature will certainly
not produce a disease whose habitat is the hottest zone, nor will a
sudden chill of the surface be accepted as a sufficient cause so long
as men daily remain exempt after a sudden plunge into cold water.Some
other factor must be invoked to account for the outbreak of specific
(epidemic) dysentery.The influence of the nervous system, the mechanical and chemical or
specific action of the ingesta and dejecta, remain to be especially
considered in the etiology of the disease.The influence of the nervous system is more directly seen in the
production of diarrhoeas than dysenteries, but that sustained
disturbances of the emotions play an important part in the production
of dysentery is shown by the greater frequency of the disease among
prisoners of war.In the Franco-Prussian war the French prisoners
suffered more than the Germans, and the records of prison-life in our
own war, at Andersonville, Libby, and Salisbury, furnish ghastly
chapters in the history of this disease.Many other factors contribute
to the development of the disease under such circumstances--in fact,
all the cruelties of man's inhumanity to man--but the influence of the
nervous system is too plain to be mistaken.The communication between
the cervical ganglia and the sympathetic nerve-fibres which preside
over the cerebral circulation and regulate intestinal peristalsis has
been invoked (Glax) in explanation of the direct action of the brain
upon the intestinal canal.Curious in this {791} connection is the
claim of Savignac, who considered dysentery a disease of the nervous
system because in two cases he found spots of softening in the spinal
cord.The noxious action of irritating articles of diet has been recognized
in the production of dysentery from the earliest times.Aretaeus
mentions acrid foods, and Aetius crudities, as directly causing the
disease; and unripe fruits have been especially stigmatized from the
days of Galen down.Decomposing, fermenting food and drink cause
diarrhoea much more frequently than dysentery, but if the irritation be
severe or prolonged, or be superimposed upon a catarrhal state, a
diarrhoea, it is claimed, may pass over into dysentery.Impurities in
drinking-water were charged with causing dysentery by Hippocrates
himself, with whom Avicenna fully coincided; and the view that
epidemics of the disease are caused in this way has been abundantly
advocated ever since.So far as running water is concerned, the
researches of Pettenkofer have shown that all impurities are speedily
destroyed, for even at the distance of a few rods from the reception of
sewage the water is perfectly safe.Nor does standing water lack the
means of purification, provided it be sufficiently exposed to the air.The observations of Roth and Lex have shown that the water of the wells
of fifteen churchyards in Berlin contained nitrates in less quantity
than the average wells in the city; and Fleck made a similar statement
with regard to the wells of Dresden.But no one in our day would rely
upon a mere chemical analysis in the detection of the organic poisons
or particles of disease.It is the physiological test which remains the
most conclusive, and the evidence in favor of the production of
dysentery by the ingestion of drinking-water poisoned by the reception
of excrementitious matter, especially the dejecta of disease, is as
positive as in the case of typhoid fever.Thus, De Renzy found that the
number of cases of dysentery "immediately decreased at Sibsagor (India)
so soon as better drinking-water was obtained from wells deeply sunk
and lined with earthenware glazed pipes;" and Payne found that the
cases of dysentery (as well as diarrhoea and lumbrici) almost
disappeared from the asylum at Calcutta as soon as the habit of
drinking water from the latrines was stopped.In face of such facts,
which might be infinitely multiplied, one would hesitate to subscribe
to the statement of Fergusson that "true dysentery is the offspring of
heat and moisture, of moist cold in any shape after excessive heat; but
nothing that a man could put into him would ever give him a true
dysentery."The relation of the action of the dejecta must be studied from the
double standpoint of the development and the dissemination of the
disease, as originating the catarrhal form by mechanical or chemical
irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and as spreading the specific form
by direct or indirect infection.By the time the contents of the alimentary canal have reached the colon
they have become, through absorption of their fluids, more or less
inspissated, and hence as hard, globular masses fill the sacculi of the
large intestine.Mechanical irritations by crude, indigestible residue
of any kind of food, more especially of vegetable food, or chemical
irritations, as by fermenting food, accumulate in this region, fret the
mucous membrane into a state of inflammation, even ulceration, and
produce the anatomical picture and the clinical signs of dysentery.If
there be a superadded or {792} pre-existent catarrhal condition of the
mucosa or a defective peristalsis of the muscular coat, which is
sluggish enough at best, the development of a pathological state is
much facilitated.And there is no doubt that the dysentery of the
tropics is increased by the bulky, indigestible, feces-producing
character of the food.The anatomical construction of the colon may also favor these processes
by its mere abnormal length or size or by duplicatures in its course.The protracted constipation of the insane, in whom the transverse colon
is often found elongated or displaced--to assume the well-known M-form,
for instance--may partially account for the frequency of dysentery in
these cases (Virchow), though the neglect which comes of preoccupation
of the mind, with the general inhibition of peristalsis, is a more
frequent cause of the constipation.Wernich (1879) sums up the action of the feces, independently of a
specific cause, in attributing the dysentery of the tropics, aside from
the great changes of temperature, to (1) bad aborts, the dejecta being
deposited in all parts of the towns or into an opening made in the
floor of the hut, with which is associated total lack of personal
cleanliness; (2) to the diet, which causes a large amount of feces; and
(3) to the relaxation of the intestine in general, permitting
accumulations of infecting matter.Upon the question of the propagation of the disease by the dejecta rest
in great measure the all-important problems of a specific virus and of
the contagiousness of the disease.It is the almost universal opinion of those who have had the
opportunity of widest observation that epidemic dysentery arises from,
or is due to, a specific cause, a miasm, a malaria (in its wide
etymologic sense, bad air), which emanates from the soil.The
simultaneous sudden attack of great numbers under the most diverse
surroundings admits of explanation in no other way.But the precise
nature of the morbific agent is still unknown.The similarity of
epidemic dysentery to malaria would indicate the existence of a low
form of vegetable life, a schizomycete, as the direct cause of the
disease.But the proof of the presence of a specific parasite or germ
is still lacking, and though its speedy disclosure by means of the
solid-culture soils may be confidently predicted, it cannot, in the
light of existing knowledge, be declared as yet.Especial difficulty is encountered in the study of micro-organisms in
diseases of the alimentary canal because of the myriad variety in
enormous numbers found in healthy stools.Decomposition and
fermentation both begin in the large intestine, so that the feces swarm
with the bacteria and torulae productive of these processes.Woodward
declares that his own observations have satisfied him that "a large
part of the substance of the normal human feces is made up of these low
forms in numbers which must be estimated by hundreds of millions in the
feces of each day," bacteria, micrococci, and torulae being found
"floating in countless multitudes along with fragments of
partly-digested muscular fibres and other debris from the food;" but
while the torulae are increased, the other micro-organisms, bacteria,
etc., do not appear to be more numerous in the stools of dysentery than
in healthy feces.The doctrine that dysentery depends upon parasites is very old in
medicine, and included animal as well as vegetable growths.Langius
(1659) declared that swarms of worms could be found in dysenteric
stools, and {793} Nyander (1760) went so far as to call dysentery a
scabies intestinorum interna; which extravagant conception would have
speedily met with merited oblivion had not his preceptor, the great
Linnaeus, incorporated the Acarus dysenteriae into his _Systema
Naturae_.Sydenham about this time (1670) expressed a much clearer
conviction of the cause of the disease when he spoke of "particles
mixed with the atmosphere which war against health and which determine
epidemic constitutions."Baly (1849) first proclaimed the idea of a vegetable fungus, similar to
that described by Brittan and Swayne in cholera, as the parasite of the
disease; and Salisbury (1865) described algoid cells and species of
confervae as occurring abundantly in all well-marked cases.Klebs
(1867) found spore-heaps and rod-like bacteria in the stools of
dysentery as in cholera, but maintained that those of dysentery were
larger and thinner than those of cholera.Hallier (1869) maintained
that although there was no morphological difference in the
micro-organisms of the stools of dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera,
he was able by culture-experiments to develop the micrococcus of
dysentery into a special fungus, which he called Leiosporium
dysentericum.Busch (1868) demonstrated nests and colonies of
micrococci, as well as mycelium, in the villi and among the glands of
the mucous and submucous tissues in the cases of dysentery from Mexico
which he examined, but Heubner (1870) was able to disclose them in
equal numbers in preserved preparations or fresh contents of healthy
intestines.Dyer[4] (1870) believes that the parasites constituting the
mildew or sweat which forms a viscous pellicle upon fruit is the agent
which directly produces and propagates the disease.Mere immaturity of
fruit gives rise only to diarrhoea.This parasite occurs in some years
more than others, which accounts for the irregularity of occurrence of
the disease.He avers that it is only necessary to clean fruit, more
especially plums, to prevent the disease.This suggestion merits place
only as a curiosity in the history of the mycology of dysentery.[Footnote 4: _Journal f. Kinderkrankheiten_, No.More important are the results of the experiments of Rajewski (1875),
who found the lymph-spaces filled with bacteria, and who was able to
produce a diphtheritic exudation upon the surface and in the substance
of the mucous membrane of the colon by the injection of fluids
impregnated with bacteria into the bowels or blood of rabbits; but this
result was only obtained when the mucous membrane had been previously
irritated or brought into a catarrhal state by the introduction of
dilute solutions of ammonia.It remains for subsequent investigation to
confirm these highly significant conclusions, which, when properly
interpreted, may explain the action of the predisposing and exciting
causes of the disease.Rajewski's bacteria, it is needless to state,
were simply the bacteria of common putrefaction.Lastly, Prior (1883)
describes a micrococcus as the special micro-organism of dysentery, and
Koch (1883), in prosecuting his studies of cholera in Egypt, remarks
incidentally upon a special bacillus which he encountered in the
intestinal canal in dysentery, though he is as yet by no means prepared
to ascribe to it pathogenetic properties.The question of contagion hinges upon the specificness of the disease,
and cannot be definitely determined until this problem is finally
solved.The old writers believed in the contagion of dysentery.Helidaeus {794} declared that he "had often seen it communicated by the
use of clyster-pipes previously used in the treatment of those
suffering with the disease, and not properly cleaned;" and Horstius and
Hildanus speak of the communicability of the disease from the latrines
contaminated by dysenteric excreta.Van Swieten maintained that
washerwomen contract it, and that physicians and nurses might be
affected.Degner saw the disease spread from street to street in
Nimeguen, while every one who came in contact with the disease became
affected.Pringle observed it spread from tent to tent in the same way;
and Tissot went so far as to declare, "Sil ya une maladie veritablement
contagieuse c'est celle ci."Ziemssen believed that the disease is only
contagious when the element of crowd-poisoning is superadded; and
Heubner states that trustworthy army surgeons in the Franco-Prussian
War frequently saw infection occur when many severe cases were heaped
together in a small space.Under these circumstances thorough
disinfection of the privies checked the spread of the disease.But it
was the universal testimony of these surgeons, as also of our own
surgeons of the Civil War, that the disease was never transported to
the civil population by any of the tens of thousands of cases on their
return to their homes.By most modern writers dysentery is given a place, in respect to
contagion, between the exanthematous maladies, typhus and scarlatina,
which are without doubt contagious, and the purely miasmatic diseases,
malarial and yellow fevers, which are without doubt not contagious.Dysentery is ranked with typhoid fever, which is contagious, not by
contact with the body, but with the discharges.It is not a question in
dysentery of epithelial drift or pulmonary exhalations, but of
ingestion or reception of the dejecta of the disease.By this
observation it is intended to convey the impression that dysentery,
like typhoid fever, is mostly spread in this way, but the reverse may
be true; it may be spread, like yellow fever and malaria, by poisons in
the air.But dysentery, as has been repeatedly remarked, is only a
clinical expression of a disease which may be caused in many ways; and
among these causes, least potent perhaps, but present nevertheless, is
contagion.For, not to mention the epidemics which were undoubtedly
spread in this way, as among the Allies at Valmy in 1792, among the
French in Poland in 1807, and in the hospital at Metz in 1870,
dysentery has been directly communicated by the use of clysters,
bed-pans, and privies in a most unmistakable way.According to Eichhorst, the poison of dysentery is endowed with
extraordinary persistence of duration or tenacity of life in the
stools; for "observations are recorded where dysenteric stools have
been emptied into privies, and individuals employed to clean them out
after the lapse of ten years have been infected with the disease.These
observations go to prove, of this as of other similar affections
(typhoid fever), that the virus or microbe of the disease finds its
most favorable nidus in vaults, cesspools, sewers, etc.When the poison
is exposed to the air it is much more speedily destroyed, but is in the
mean time of course a possible conveyer of the disease."Fayrer quotes
from an anonymous writer, "whose views are as remarkable for their
force as for their originality," the rather extravagant assertion that
"if human excrement be not exposed to the air there can be no
dysentery."{795} Knoewenagel has recently[5] opened up a new series of reflections
in his suggestion of a possible direct infection of the large intestine
per rectum, where the disease usually begins and is mostly best
expressed.He calls attention to the fact that people who suffer with
constipation indulge in longer sessions at stools and induce in
straining efforts a degree of relaxation of the rectal mucosa.The
mucous membrane at its orifice may become at the same time abraded by
hardened fecal masses, to leave open surfaces or crevices upon which
germs may lodge.Moreover, aspiration follows the efforts at expulsion,
and the air with its particles is drawn directly into the rectum, thus
affording all the conditions for immediate or direct infection.[Footnote 5: _Schmidt's Jahrbucher_, Sept.At any rate, it must be admitted that the evidence in favor of
contagion is in some cases too strong to be ignored.A single instance
may suffice for illustration: Flugel reports that the towns of
Nordhaben and Reichenbach, containing together twenty-two hundred
inhabitants, were visited by dysentery in 1873, when nearly four
hundred people were attacked.The visit of a relative carried the
disease from Reichenbach to the daughter of an innkeeper at Tauchnitz,
and from this house the disease spread over the whole place, so that in
a short time more than one hundred people fell ill.Four to six,
sometimes as many as eleven, members of one family were successively or
simultaneously affected.The use of the same bed was the surest means
of contagion.The duration of the poison was proven in an exquisite case, which is,
however, not entirely free from objection: Two children of an officer
were severely affected in September and October, 1872.In January,
1873, the house was vacated and occupied by a successor in office,
whereupon in April, six months after dysentery had disappeared from the
place, the wife and child of the second officer were affected with the
disease.To sum up the etiology of dysentery in a few words, it may be said that
few chapters in medicine are so thoroughly unsatisfactory, as the
prospect of reconciling the accumulated discordant facts is very
discouraging.Because of the singular uniformity in the symptoms and
lesions the temptation is strong to look for a common cause, and to
ascribe all cases to this cause, explaining differences by degree
rather than by kind.Such a view would find solid support in the
assumption of a specific germ, and would ally dysentery with typhoid
fever, a disease which has likewise, in all cases, uniform symptoms and
lesions, and which prevails in both sporadic and epidemic form.The
advocates of this view would fix the poison of the disease in the air
and alimentary canal (but not in the blood), and explain the existence
of individual cases, as well as the prevalence of epidemics, by
meteorological conditions as affecting the growth or dissemination of
specific germs.Nor would the adoption of this view exclude the
possibility of producing the catarrhal (sporadic) cases by many kinds
of noxious germs, including those of common putrefaction.Hot air and
wet air are notorious bearers and breeders of germs, and the law of
gravity keeps them near the surface of the earth--conditions which
coincide with the prevalence of the disease in the tropics and among
individuals (soldiers) who sleep upon the ground.If the contagion of
the disease be admitted, the existence of a {796} contagium animatum is
implied at once, for no chemical poison has the power of propagation.But the germ of dysentery has not been found as yet, and until it has
been found, cultivated in suitable soil, and inoculated to produce the
disease, the evidence of its existence remains merely presumptive.So that at the present time dysentery must be regarded as a malady
which stands in closer relation to, or finds a better analogue in,
cholera than typhoid fever; for cholera is a disease which has the same
geography, has likewise nearly uniform symptoms and lesions, so far as
it leaves any, and certainly has two distinct forms of origin--one
clearly specific, cholera Asiatica, and the other catarrhal, cholera
morbus.PATHOLOGY.--Dysentery is a local malady, but, like every local malady
if sufficiently severe, it may show constitutional effects.It is
usually gradually ushered in from a lighter form of gastro-intestinal
catarrh.After a stage of incubation which lasts from a few hours to a
few days symptoms of dyspepsia and diarrhoea set in or increase,
attended with anorexia, heartburn, nausea, eructation or borborygmi,
pain in the abdomen, and copious fluid discharges.Hereupon ensue the
pains and the discharges characteristic of the disease.Violent griping
and colicky pains (tormina) traverse the abdomen, with sickening
sensations of depression.The desire of evacuation of the bowels
(tenesmus) becomes intense and more or less constant, and the discharge
itself is attended with little or no relief.At the same time the
region of the rectum, intensely inflamed, is the seat of intolerable
burning pain, which becomes excruciating with the introduction of a
speculum or the finger.The discharges may be copious, dark-brown, thin, and highly offensive
(bilious dysentery), may contain occasional hard round fecal casts of
intestinal sacculi (scybalae), or may become more and more scant, until
with the most violent efforts only the minutest quantity is extruded of
mucus, generally streaked or tinged with blood (rose mucus) like the
rusty sputum of pneumonia.Later, all effort at emptying the alimentary
canal may be futile (dysenteria sicca), or the mucus may be pure or
commingled with pus to remain perfectly colorless (dysenteria alba), or
with blood in larger quantity (dysenteria rubra).In other cases, or at
other periods in the same case, the discharges consist of fleshy masses
composed of inspissated mucus or pus, blood, and tissue-debris (lotura
carnea).Sometimes, though rarely, the discharges consist of pure
blood, but oftener of a copious turbid fluid, which on standing
separates into a clear upper layer of serum and a sediment of
disintegrated lotura carnea.Or, lastly, the sediment is composed of
small round vitreous masses, evidently swollen by maceration to look
like sago-grains, which have been erroneously supposed to represent the
liberated contents of the intestinal follicles.The general condition of the patient suffers correspondingly.There may
be fever or there may be none throughout the whole course of the
disease, but the pain and discharges quickly exhaust the strength of
the patient, and in severe or long-continued cases lead to emaciation
and profound prostration.The skin is hot and dry; the tongue is heavily coated; the face wears
an anxious expression.The abdomen is tumid with gases, or in more
advanced cases sunken, discolored, and tender, especially in the course
{797} of the colon, whose thickened walls may often be felt beneath the
emaciated surface.The anus is spasmodically constricted, or in the
worst cases paralyzed, patulous, and livid or blue.Prolapse of the
rectum is common in children, and excoriation of the perineum by the
acrid discharges is not infrequent.Finally, a typhoid state may set in or a pyaemia occur, when the
discharges may become involuntary or unconscious, and brain
symptoms--insomnia, stupor, delirium, and coma--supervene; or the
patient may linger long enough to perish by simple exhaustion or
marasmus.Under favorable hygiene the great majority of cases of catarrhal
dysentery recover without special treatment in the course of from three
to ten days, but specific dysentery has no definite duration and but
little tendency to spontaneous cure.The worst cases are often quickly
controlled by appropriate interference, and the most surprising results
may be sometimes obtained in cases of even years' duration.On the
other hand, a certain percentage of cases is characterized by a
defiance to every kind of treatment, including the last resort, a
change of climate.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery generally subsides without
lesions, and the natural duration of the attack may be much abbreviated
by proper treatment.Specific or epidemic dysentery lasts from two to
four weeks, or, becoming chronic, continues for years or for life, with
exacerbations and remissions.Various complications are liable to occur in the course of the disease.Three deserve especial mention--viz.affection of the joints
(rheumatism), paralysis, and abscess of the liver.Perforation and
peritonitis, always possibilities, and deformities of the colon,
thickenings, and constrictions, are not infrequently left.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions of dysentery are the ordinary signs of
inflammation of a mucous membrane and its subjacent structures.They do
not differ in any essential way from those of any mucous surface in a
state of inflammation, the minor variations being due to differences in
the anatomy and physiology of the part affected.Thus, a description of
the pathological process in inflammation of the pharynx, bronchi, or
uterus would answer upon the post-mortem table for the same process in
the large intestine, and the finer microscopic lesions could be
differentiated in any case only by the histology of the part affected.A slight lesion of any mucous membrane constitutes what is known as a
catarrhal process; a more grave affection, a diphtheritic process; a
more chronic inflammation, a hypertrophic or hyperplastic process.Hence an easy distinction between sporadic and epidemic cases might be
based upon the character of the lesion found.But, as has been stated
already, it is impossible to draw a line between catarrhal and specific
cases, the same lesions being found in either form.The difference, so
far as the morbid anatomy is concerned, is wholly in degree or stage,
and not at all in kind, the specific (epidemic) form presenting the
graver lesion as a rule.So most cases of sporadic dysentery show only
catarrhal lesions, while most cases of epidemic dysentery show
diphtheritic lesions.Catarrhal dysentery shows as its first obvious alteration a hyperaemia
of the mucous surface.It is limited exclusively to the large intestine
in the vast majority of cases, and only in rare exceptions affects the
small intestine, though cases have been mentioned as curiosities in
which the {798} process has reached the stomach in its upmost
prolongation.The hyperaemia is most marked, as a rule, in the lowest
parts of the large intestine, the rectum and descending colon, but
there is, as Virchow has pointed out, a peculiar predisposition to
affection at the seat of all the flexures, the iliac, hepatic, splenic,
sigmoid, where the additional element of fecal arrest or impaction is
superadded to the cause of the disease.The catarrhal process occurs first in detached spots or streaks upon
the projecting folds or duplicatures of the mucous membrane; which
spots coalesce to form extensive surfaces.Examined by transmitted
light, these surfaces show a distinct arborescence of the vessels.Or
the disease may commence in the follicles in distinct areas of the
large intestine, and may remain confined to these structures to
constitute the variety known as follicular dysentery.The hyperaemia of inflammation is attended with dilatation and paresis
of the vessel-walls and retardation of the circulation.The whole
process may be arrested at this stage, so that there escapes from the
vessels, at most, only serum to develop the oedema which, with the
defective nutrition from arrest of the circulation, gives rise to the
softening of the epithelial cells.These cells may be thus lifted from
their bed to constitute the process of desquamation, the fundamental
anatomical characteristic of acute dysentery, by which process the
submucous connective tissue is laid bare and the so-called catarrhal
ulcer results.Or the epithelium, but partially detached, may remain
upon the surface, "either raised in the shape of small vesicles which
contain clear serum, or it forms a grayish-white layer resembling the
mealy scurf of the epidermis--an appearance which probably induced
Linnaeus to term dysentery scabies intestinorum interna" (Rokitansky).Kelsch maintains that the inflammatory process in dysentery commences
in the delicate connective tissue between the follicles, the network of
small spindle-shaped cells with multiple nuclei becoming speedily
penetrated by a number of very small, newly-formed vessels.Where the
epithelium is desquamated the surface is covered with granulations as
after a wound.The disposition of the follicles is soon deranged, for,
instead of standing in rows like gun-barrels, they are pushed asunder
and uplifted, so as to remain at different heights.Their interior
becomes blocked with mucus or their orifices occluded, so that
retention-cysts are formed to give rise to the appearance of the bead
necklace.Soon the walls of neighboring follicles coalesce, dissolve
away, and communication is established between them.The interior of
these communicating tubes or canals is filled with vitreous mucus; the
walls are stripped of their lining cells, but their "blind extremities
contain still adherent colossal epithelial cells."Moreover, the
follicles break into each other under the proliferative budding
process, so that the end of a distorted tube may be found in the
interior of another.Where follicles are destroyed the mucous membrane
above them or in their vicinity collapses--a condition observed and
described by Colin as effrondement.The mucosa in these regions may
appear perfectly uninjured, but by "blowing upon it with a tube it is
lifted up like an ampulla to show an opening in its centre," though
more frequently the mucous membrane collapses or sinks in at the region
of destruction.The inner surface of the mucosa is rendered
additionally uneven by the elevations or protuberances caused by the
{799} proliferations in the submucous connective tissue.The older
writers (Pringle, Hewson) regarded these projections as tumors of the
mucosa, and Rokitansky, who describes their true nature, speaks of them
as warty, tubercular (nodular) swellings or fungoid
excrescences--constituting a condition, he says, which Gely has termed
hypertrophie mamelonne.The alternate elevations and depressions thus
produced have been likened to the representations of bird's-eye views
of mountain-chains.As a rule, occasional red blood-corpuscles are also permitted to escape
through the vessel walls in the process of diapedesis to give to the
surface mucus its characteristic tinge, and punctate submucous
hemorrhage is very frequently seen.The pressure of the swollen, softened mucosa upon the sensitive nerves,
and the irritation of the acrid intestinal contents, are often invoked
to account for the constant desire of defecation (tenesmus) which
constitutes such an essential symptom of the disease; but both the
tenesmus and the colicky pains (tormina) precede the anatomical
changes, and are much more rationally explained by the direct action
upon the nerves of the cause of the disease, or by the derangement of
innervation effected through changes in the circulation.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery may exhibit no further lesions,
and in the lightest cases even these may have entirely disappeared
post-mortem, so that no change at all may be observed at the autopsy.In a more severe or protracted case the other alterations which
constitute the more complete cycle of the inflammatory process follow
the stage of hyperaemia.The arrest of circulation becomes more or less
complete, and the white corpuscles emigrate from the vessels to form
the pus-cells.Fibrin, or the elements which compose it, also escapes
to infiltrate the mucous membrane and remain upon its surface.The
pseudo-membranous or diphtheritic process is now developed, and may
vary in intensity from a mere frosting of the surface to dense
infiltration of the entire thickness.The false membrane, as well as
the mucous membrane, next suffers necrosis to form more or less
extensive sloughs.These sloughs are grayish-white when fresh,
dark-brown when stained by the intestinal contents, or greenish or
black when undergoing gangrene.They may cover patches of the mucosa or
the whole mucosa from the ileo-caecal valve to the rectum.They soon
become soft and pultaceous, hang in flaps or festoons in the interior
of the intestinal tube, or, detached, are voided in fragments or
shreds.One such fragment nine inches long is recorded in Woodward's
exhaustive description of the pathology of this disease.Examined under
the microscope, they are seen to consist of coagulated fibrin, red and
white blood-corpuscles, epithelial cells and debris, necrotic pieces of
mucosa, and myriads of micrococci and other micro-organisms.The fall of the sloughs leaves the dysenteric ulcer.Its edges are
irregular and ragged, its base uneven like a crater, and its surface is
more or less covered with pultaceous debris.The submucous connective
tissue may form its base, or, this structure having been also
destroyed, the muscularis may be exposed, or in more extensive
necrobiosis the peritoneum itself may be laid bare.Occasionally this
last barrier is broken down, and perforation occurs.Or an acute
peritonitis may be developed, in dysentery as in typhoid fever, by
simple extension of the inflammatory {800} process without perforation.Perforation is very rare in cases of follicular ulceration, and is by
no means frequent in the diphtheritic process, but it is the most
frequent cause of peritonitis in chronic dysentery.It may occur in any
part of the colon, but does occur most frequently in the caecum.The
resulting peritonitis is fatal as a rule, but the danger is obviated
sometimes, as in typhoid fever, by agglutination of the gut to a
contiguous structure or viscus.Perforation usually occurs late in the
disease, but it may occur very early.Thus Nagele reports from the
Franco-Prussian War a case in which perforation took place on the
fourth day, the diagnosis having been confirmed by an autopsy.In rare
cases a perityphlitis may ensue, with its natural consequences, or
periproctitis may be developed with perineal abscess, or, finally,
fistulae may form to burrow about and discharge themselves anywhere in
or upon the surface of the abdomen, the lumbar region, or the thigh.Bamberger describes cases of perityphlitis attending dysentery, in some
of which resorption occurred, while in others pus was discharged upon
the surface of the abdomen; and the writer of this article once saw, in
consultation with T. A. Reamy, a case of fistula which extended from
the descending colon to the vagina.Through the opening made to
discharge the pus from a fluctuating abscess pointing in the vaginal
vault an india-rubber tube could be passed for six to eight inches.The
patient finally died from marasmus.Chronic dysentery is distinguished by the alterations which occur in
inflammation developing more gradually and extending over a longer
period of time.Under the irritative changes resulting from an altered
circulation the connective tissue undergoes marked hyperplasia, so that
the wall of the intestine becomes at times enormously thickened, and
its calibre is often correspondingly diminished.Cornil observes that
acute or subacute dysentery is characterized by infiltration of the
submucous connective tissue, followed by destruction, while in chronic
dysentery the predominant lesion is essentially a proliferation and
thickening of the connective tissue of the large intestine.The
muscular tissue also undergoes hypertrophy, and the peritoneum becomes
thickened and opaque.Sometimes the peritoneum is covered with patches
of false membrane, or agglutination occurs with other portions of the
intestine to give rise to contortions or occlusions.Ulceration shows itself in chronic dysentery in every grade and stage
of the process, from the first denudations to old cicatrizations.In
bad cases the whole course of the colon from the ileo-caecal valve to
the rectum may constitute one vast tract of suppuration.Blood-vessels
may be opened by the necrotic process, and copious, even fatal,
hemorrhage may ensue.When pure blood is discharged, the hemorrhage
usually occurs in this way per rhexem, but the quantities of blood
evacuated with other elements usually escape per diapedesem.The cicatrization which results puckers the edges of the ulcers, and
may in cases of extensive or circular ulceration lead to more or less
stenosis of the intestinal tube.According to Rindfleisch, the scars of
dysenteric ulcers are very prone to contract, so that "the liability of
a subsequent stricture is directly proportionate to the extent of the
previous ulceration."The danger in these cases may be immediate from
entire, or more remote from partial, occlusion.Thus, Bamberger records
a case of {801} typhlitis due to impaction of feces above a stenosis
gradually developed from a dysenteric ulcer.Although dysentery is a disease of the large intestine, its lesions are
not exclusively limited to this structure.It is always a purely local
disease at first, and, strictly speaking, continues so throughout its
course, yet it produces in severe or chronic cases widespread and
general effects.Rapid emaciation sets in, and anaemia is soon
pronounced in all the internal organs.The mesenteric glands show signs
of irritation or of absorption of specific products in hyperaemic
pigmentation and hyperplasia.The kidneys in acute cases exhibit venous
stasis, and in chronic cases may undergo parenchymatous change.The
joints are peculiarly liable to suffer in certain cases, and the
nervous system may exhibit lesions--points to be described in the
symptomatology of the disease.Should pyaemia occur, it superimposes
its own particular lesions in the serous membranes and internal organs.All of these affections are to be regarded, however, rather as
complications than essential effects.But the liver is found affected so frequently in dysentery as to
constitute more than a mere coincidence.Schneider has recently (1873)
reported of the results of his observations on 1400 cases of tropical
dysentery that in the 395 post-mortem examinations the liver was found
normal in but 10 cases.The abnormalities were as follows: hyperaemia
of various grades, 160; fatty degeneration, 62; abscess, 57; nutmeg
liver, 47; perihepatitis, 25; granular atrophy, 19; syphilitic atrophy,
8; cicatrices, 6; excavation with helminth, 1.Berenger-Feraud (1883)
reports of 411 fatal cases of dysentery observed at Senegal that the
liver appeared sound to the naked eye 98 times (23 per cent.)and
diseased "undeniably" 313 times (77 per cent.).Of the 313 cases of
hepatic affection there were found--hypertrophy, softening, or
hyperaemia, 123 times (39 per cent.); abscess, 143 times (46 per
cent.); simple discoloration, 29 times (9 per cent.); atrophy or
cirrhosis, 18 times (6 per cent.).Annesley found abscess of the liver
21 times in 29 cases of dysentery; Hospel, 13 times in 25 cases; and
Budd found ulceration of the large intestine 10 times in 17 cases of
hepatic abscess.Gluck had the opportunity of making 28 post-mortem
examinations in 151 cases of dysentery in Bucharest, finding abscess of
the liver 16 times.All these authors adopt the explanation first
offered by Budd of direct transfer of diseased products through the
mesenteric and portal veins.But more extensive observation has developed the fact that the
frequency of abscess of the liver in connection with dysentery is a
peculiarity of tropical climates.In the temperate and colder regions
of the North this complication is not by any means so frequent.Frerichs declares that of 16 observations collected by Louis and
Andral, "ulcers were present in only 3, and in 2 of these cases the
ulcers were tubercular; of his own 8 cases, there was intestinal
affection in none."Gluck believes that the liver is more prone to show
suppuration when already predisposed to it by a preceding amyloid or
cirrhotic change of malarial origin.Eichhorst calls attention to the
well-known fact that abscess of the liver is especially a disease of
the tropics independently of dysentery, and the frequency of its
occurrence here may be a mere coincidence.But it must be remembered
that opportunity for post-mortem examination, upon the {802} results of
which these statistics are based, does not occur in the great majority
of cases of dysentery, and abscess of the liver is very often
overlooked.Thus, Schneider cites cases where persons with abscess of
the liver of the size of the head were considered simulants up to
twenty-four hours before death.Since the diagnosis of hepatic abscess
has been made so easy by aspiration, cases begin to multiply; and it is
doubtless the experience of most practitioners, in the temperate zone
at least, that the decided majority of cases of hepatic abscess
acknowledge an existing or previous attack of dysentery.Certainly, few
authors would now venture to subscribe to the view of Annesley, that
the abscess of the liver was the primary malady and was the cause of
the dysentery.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Dysentery, as stated, begins, as a rule, with the
general signs of a gastro-intestinal catarrh.So frequent is this mode
of inception, and so few are the exceptions, that it is impossible to
resist the conclusion that the disease is caused by the introduction of
a noxious element into the alimentary canal.The irritation thus
induced begins at the stomach, and is rapidly propagated throughout the
whole tract of the intestine.In the course of a few days the cause of
the disease becomes strictly localized to the large intestine, whose
greater capacity and more sluggish movement fit it for the easier
reception and longer retention of noxious matter.But specific dysentery and the more intense forms of catarrhal
dysentery occasionally exhibit distinctive symptoms from the start, and
in rarer cases the disease is suddenly announced with such tempestuous
signs as to excite the suspicion of poisoning.Thus, a case (one of
five lighter cases) is reported from the Rudolfstiftung in Vienna
(1878) where the disease closely simulated Asiatic cholera, and where
it rapidly ran a fatal course, in spite of laudanum, soda-water, ice
pills, mustard plasters, injections of amyl nitrite, camphor, and
ether, and faradization of the phrenic nerve to stimulate the failing
respiration.Finger reports similar cases from the hospital at Prague.Ordinarily, the peculiar pains of dysentery first proclaim the
character of the disease.The severe grinding, twisting pains, tormina,
are more or less localized in the course of the colon, and hence
surround or traverse the entire abdomen, the pains at the epigastrium
being due to spasmodic contractions of the transverse colon.The
patient in vain adopts various postures in relief or sits with his
hands firmly compressing the abdominal walls.The tormina are more or
less intermittent or remittent, and are usually experienced in greatest
severity toward evening.During their acme the face wears the aspect of
the intense suffering, which is expressed in outcries and groans.At
the same time there is upon pressure over the whole abdomen more or
less tenderness, which soon comes to be especially localized at the
caecum or sigmoid flexure.The tenesmus (cupiditas egerendi) is a more distressing, and certainly
more distinctive, sign of dysentery.It is the feeling of heavy weight
or oppression, of the presence of a foreign body in the rectum, which
demands instant relief.At the same time intense heat is felt in the
rectum, which the patient likens sometimes to the passage of a red-hot
iron.The desire of evacuation becomes as frequent as urgent.In
well-marked cases the patient sits at stool half an hour or an hour at
a time, straining until faint {803} and exhausted, leaving the commode
with reluctance, only immediately or very soon to use it again.Great depression is felt at the stomach at the same time, with nausea,
occasionally with vomiting; and strangury, with the discharge of only a
few drops of scalding urine or blood from the bladder, adds additional
suffering to the disease.Retraction of the testicle and prolapsus ani,
especially in children, are prone to occur in severe cases.But neither the pain nor the prostration is so characteristic of
dysentery as the stools, which, though of very varied nature, are
nevertheless distinctive.After the discharge of the intestinal
contents the first evacuations consist of mucus in the form of glairy,
stringy matter, like the white of an egg, expressed as the result of
the violent efforts at straining.The mucus may be pure or tinged with
blood, but it is usually very scant in quantity, and stands in this
regard in marked contrast with the violence of the efforts to secure
its extrusion.It is the frequency of its discharge which constitutes
an especial distress.Twenty to forty, even two hundred, times in the
twenty-four hours the patient must go to stool.In the worst cases the
patient sits at stool or lies upon the bed-pan the most of the day.The mucus is sooner or later mingled with pus or stained with blood.The presence of pus by no means necessarily implies the existence of
ulceration, as the apparently pure mucus always shows occasional white
blood-corpuscles under the microscope, and even extensive suppurations
occur without apparent solutions of continuity.The presence of blood is equally characteristic of dysenteric stools.Usually it is intimately commingled with the mucus or pus or forms the
chief element of the copious so-called bilious discharge.The
evacuation of pure blood indicates erosion of vessels low in the colon,
often in the rectum itself, though enormous quantities of blood are
sometimes voided from unbroken surfaces.Thus Lecard reports the case
of a soldier who "while sitting restless at stool lost one and a half
quarts of blood."The patient died on the fifth day of the disease, and
at the autopsy there was found "apoplectiform congestion from the
ileo-caecal valve to the anus, but no ulcers anywhere, nor any broken
vessels."Besides the mucus, pus, and blood, the dysenteric stools contain the
sloughs which have been torn off by violent peristalsis in cases of the
diphtheritic form.Usually they are separated in shreds and fragments,
but occasionally large sheets, even casts of a section of the colon,
are voided en masse.These were the cases considered by the older
authors to be detachments of the mucous membrane itself.As already
observed, these fragments consist for the most part of inspissated
mucus, pus, blood, and tissue-debris; but there is no doubt that in
some cases partially necrosed mucosa also enters into their
construction.One enormous tubular cast fourteen inches long, preserved
in our Army Medical Museum, was found to be "composed of
pseudo-membranous lymph in which no traces of the structure of the
mucous membrane could be detected" (Woodward).There still remains to be mentioned the boiled-sago or frogs'-spawn
matter whose origin has given rise to such a curious mistake.Not
infrequently these vitreous-looking bodies compose the bulk of the
sediment in the stools of dysentery, and even some of our modern
authors, {804} unacquainted with the more searching investigations of
Virchow, have regarded them as expressed contents of intestinal
follicles.Virchow found that under the application of iodine they
always assumed a blue color, whereupon he ironically remarks that the
sago-like mucus is really mucus-like sago.They are simply granules of
starch ingested as food, to remain partially or wholly undigested.The scybalae, the composite matter known as the lotura carnea, and the
micro-organisms found in the stools have already received mention
elsewhere.Although the stools of dysentery are scant, as a rule, they are so
frequent as to discharge during the entire twenty-four hours a very
large quantity of albuminous matter.Oesterlen has made the curious
calculation to show that the mean daily loss of albuminates in
dysentery of moderate intensity is from 50 to 60 grammes during the
first fourteen days, and on an average about 20 grammes during the next
eight days.The total loss experienced in an attack of three weeks'
duration thus amounts to about 1000 grammes--in rough figures, two
pounds avoirdupois.The rapidity with which emaciation, hydrops, and
marasmus occur in severe cases is thus easily accounted for.Nagele
speaks of cases where patients were reduced to skeletons in eight to
fourteen days, so that the convalescence extended over six weeks to
eight months.The alteration in the character of the secretion in dysentery is not
confined to the mucous membrane of the large intestine.On the
contrary, all the digestive juices are changed, in some cases entirely
checked.In the graver cases the saliva takes on an acid reaction and
loses its glycogenic properties; the gastric juice in the same cases
becomes alkaline and loses its peptonizing properties; while the
secretion of the bile is wholly arrested.Uffelmann, who had the rare
opportunity of studying the secretion of bile in a case of biliary
fistula, relates that during an attack of dysentery the bile ceased
entirely to flow, and only began to show itself again, at first
greenish, then greenish-brown, finally brown, during the process of
resolution on the ninth day of the disease.The anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting which so often mark the access or attend the course of
dysentery find thus easy explanation.Should the disease continue, the general strength of the patient
becomes so profoundly reduced as to resemble the status typhosus.The
tongue, which has been hitherto thickly coated, now becomes black,
shows fissures, and bleeds, while the gums are covered with sordes.The
pulse becomes feeble, thready, or barely perceptible.The skin is dry
and harsh or scaly.The abdomen is tumid or collapsed, the anus
paralyzed, and the discharges continuously ooze out to excoriate the
perineum.While the brain is usually clear throughout the disease,
insomnia, stupor, or coma develop in the gravest cases from absorption
of disease-products (Senator), or death suddenly ensues from heart-clot
or from thrombus of the venous sinuses of the dura mater (Busey).Pyaemia announces itself with a series of chills, followed by irregular
temperature, by the speedy occurrence of multiple abscesses in distant
organs, venous thromboses, affections of the serous membranes,
pleuritis, pericarditis, and embolic pneumonia.Gangrene of the
intestine, which may occur as early as the third day of the disease
(Nagele), is evidenced by the signs of general collapse.{805} COMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELAE.--The lighter cases of dysentery, as
well as most of the grave cases, run their entire course without
complication, and often without sequelae.But a certain percentage of
cases is attended with complications on the part of the joints
(rheumatism), of the nervous system (paralysis), and on the part of the
liver and the kidneys.Arthritis, when it occurs, shows itself, as a rule, in the second week
of the disease (Eichhorst), or after the disease has run its course,
during the period of convalescence (Huelte).That it is not a mere
coincidence is evidenced by the fact that it is present in a large
number of cases in certain epidemics, while it is not present
independently of dysentery.Thus, Braun of Stannenheim saw in the two
epidemics of 1833-34 more than forty cases of rheumatism, and Huelte
reports ten cases observed by himself in the epidemic at Montargis in
1854.Certain epidemics are distinguished by the rarity of this
complication, while most are marked by its absence altogether.In the
epidemic at Rahden (1872), 400 cases among 3800 inhabitants, Rapmund
saw inflammation of the joints set in only six times; and the entire
absence or extreme rarity of it in later epidemics have led most
physicians to deny any connection between the diseases, or to regard
the joint affection as incident to a complicating scorbutus or
neuralgia.All authors who admit it describe the knee-joint as being
the most frequent seat of the affection, but acknowledge that it is
mostly polyarticular; while there is much difference of opinion whether
it ever presents the general signs of true rheumatism--pyrexia,
diaphoresis, or its complications on the part of the heart.Huelte
maintains that it does not, and that it is allied to gonorrhoeal
rheumatism in this respect, while Eichhorst states that it may not only
show all these signs, but may be followed in exceptional cases by
suppuration and ankylosis.It usually lasts four to six weeks, but
neither its occurrence nor its severity stands in any relation to the
intensity of the attack of dysentery.It is probably to be regarded as
a manifestation of a light pyaemia or septicaemia, as it is a frequent
manifestation of this condition in or after scarlatina, puerperal
fever, and the septic fevers of surgery.Paralysis has been observed to occur after dysentery ever since the
days of Galen, and, disregarding the observations of ancient and of the
older periods of modern times, we find occasional records of cases in
our own days.Leyden,[6] in reporting a case of paresis and rheumatic
pains following an attack of dysentery, says that although
post-dysenteric paralysis is now rarely mentioned, it was frequent in
the older reports, and claims it as an admitted fact that it occurs not
at all infrequently now.Joseph Frank quotes some observations of this
kind, and refers especially to the dissertation of Fabricius.[7] These
paralyses, Fabricius observes, have been seen after the premature
suppression of malignant epidemics of dysentery by opiates and
astringents.Observations were afterward recorded by Graves in which
paralysis occurred after colics and inflammation of the intestines; and
English veterinary surgeons mention the fact that paralytic weakness of
the posterior extremities of horses and cattle follow attacks of
intestinal inflammation.The paralysis, when it occurs, is usually
confined to the lower extremities, but may extend to {806} and involve
the upper extremities, by preference in the form of paralysis
transversa (opposite arm and leg).Brown-Sequard attributes it to
reflex contraction of the blood-vessels; Jaccoud, to exhaustion of the
nerve-centres; and Roser, to the contact of the inflamed transverse
colon with the solar plexus.Remak first suggested the idea of an
ascending neuritis--a view which would seem to be corroborated by the
paralysis observed after the experiments, by Lewisson, of crushing the
uterus, kidneys, bladder, or loop of intestine, and which finds
additional support, as Leyden remarks, in the length of time which
lapses before it appears.Landouzy[8] says that Finger found diffuse
myelitis in a patient affected with paralysis supervening upon cancer
of the intestine, and that Delioux and Savignac saw spots of softening
in the cervical and lumbar region of the cord in the case of a man
affected with post-dysenteric paralysis.Weir Mitchell suggests the
possibility of other factors--long marches, malaria, bad diet, and
injuries to the spine--in the genesis of the cases, mostly paraplegias,
observed by him; and Woodward calls attention to lead-poisoning (as by
treatment) in explanation of a certain number of cases.[Footnote 6: "On Reflex Paralysis," _Volkmann's Sammlungen_.][Footnote 7: _Paralysis seu hemiplegia transversa resolutionem brachii
unius et pedis alterius exhibet_, Helmstedt, 1750.][Footnote 8: _Des Paralysies dans les Maladies aigues_.]Abscess of the liver gives rise to few distinctive symptoms, and is
mostly recognized or suspected, in the absence of positive signs, by
the persistence or obstinacy of the dysentery.The ease and impunity
with which aspiration may be performed in its recognition justifies the
use of it in every doubtful case.Regarding complications on the part of the kidneys, Zimmerman
recognizes four classes of cases: (1) mild cases, showing no albumen
and no casts; (2) severe, long-continued cases, with putrid stools,
status nervosus, and collapse, showing albumen; (3) cases commencing
with nervous symptoms, paralysis, scanty urine, showing kidneys filled
with exudation-cells and detritus; and (4) cases of speedy renal
complication and death.To these may be added the cases of protracted
chronic dysentery with long-continued suppuration, entailing the
possibility, of really rare actual occurrence, of amyloid degeneration
and chronic parenchymatous change (Bartels).Dysentery may be further complicated by parotitis; by venous thrombosis
(phlegmasia dolens); by diphtheritic deposits on other mucous surfaces,
which Virchow declares to be exceedingly rare; and by hydrops, which is
oftener a concomitant of the period of convalescence.Besides the deformities of the colon, which may ensue as a consequence
of ulceration or peritonitis, a long attack of dysentery is apt to
leave a hyperaesthetic or non-resistant state of the mucous surface, so
that every imprudence in exposure or in diet begets an intestinal
catarrh or a relapse of the disease.DIAGNOSIS.--When dysentery presents itself with its whole train of
symptoms the recognition of the disease is very easy.The tormina and
tenesmus, the peculiar discharges, the rapid reduction of strength,
leave no doubt as to the nature of the affection.The prevalence of an
epidemic of the disease will often establish the character of a case
even when all the signs are not present or when anomalies occur.Embarrassment in diagnosis only attends the recognition of catarrhal or
isolated cases, and in these cases there may be a doubt as between
dysentery and {807} diarrhoea--if such a symptom can be called a
disease--or typhoid fever, cholera, or some purely local affection of
the rectum, cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.In children difficulty of
diagnosis may arise as between dysentery and intussusception.Dysentery is differentiated from that lighter form of intestinal
catarrh whose main symptom is diarrhoea by the presence of tenesmus in
dysentery, as well as by its mucous, muco-purulent, diphtheritic, and
bloody discharges.Dysentery lasts longer than diarrhoea as a rule, and
does not yield so readily to treatment.Typhoid fever shows from the start brain symptoms, which are absent
from dysentery; has a typical temperature-curve, whereas there may be
no fever in dysentery, or, if any, of irregular remittent type; is
often prefaced by epistaxis and attended with bronchitis, both of which
are absent in dysentery; and exhibits ochre- pea-soup stools,
altogether different from those of dysentery.Cholera morbus distinguishes itself from dysentery by its sudden onset,
its profuse vomiting and discharges, its violent cramps, and the speedy
collapse.Cancer of the rectum can be usually felt, and hemorrhoids can be always
seen, so that no difficulty should be experienced in the recognition of
these cases.Intussusception occurs mostly in children, and has, in common with
dysentery, vomiting, mucous or bloody stools, colic, tenesmus, nervous
unrest, and prostration, so that a differential diagnosis may be
impossible for a few days.The more strict localization of an
intussusception, which may sometimes be felt as a sausage-like mass,
most frequently in the right ileum and hypochondrium, the greater
frequency and persistency of the vomiting and pain, the presence
visibly or palpably of the invaginated gut at the anus or rectum, soon
enable the careful examiner to recognize the case.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of dysentery varies between extremes.Some
cases are so mild as to merit the remark of Sydenham concerning certain
cases of scarlet fever: "Vix nomen morbi merebantur."They terminate of
themselves under favorable hygiene without especial treatment.On the
other hand, no known disease has a more frightful mortality than
dysentery in some of its epidemics, especially in army-life.It was
this class of cases which Trousseau had in mind when he called
dysentery the most murderous of all diseases.Sixty to eighty may be
the appalling percentage of death in these cases.Under favorable surroundings the average mortality of dysentery amounts
to 5-10 per cent., but is much influenced by the age and the general
condition of the patient, as well as by the complications which occur
in its course.Thus, Sydenham said of it over two hundred years ago,
"It is not infrequently fatal to adults, and still more so to old men,
but is nevertheless exceedingly harmless to infants, who will bear it
for months together without suffering, provided only Nature be left to
herself."But dysentery is by no means always harmless to infants, for
in some epidemics this period of life has been visited with the
greatest severity.Thus, Pfeilstucker reports of Wurtemberg (1873-74)
that the greatest mortality, 39 per cent., occurred at the age of one
to seven years, and the least, 4 per cent., at the age of thirty-one to
fifty years; {808} and Oesterlen says of England that dysentery causes
20 per cent.of deaths from all causes in the first year of life.Nor does the prevalence of a greater number of cases necessarily imply
a heavier mortality.For Bianchi reports of Rome that cases of
dysentery constituted but 2.28 per cent.of all the admissions into the
Ospedale di San Spirito in 1873, while in 1874 the percentage increased
to 3.68; yet the mortality of 1873 was 17.02 per cent., while that of
1874 was but 9.09 per cent.Complications on the part of the nervous system, the status typhosus,
pyaemia, and great prostration, necessarily render the prognosis grave,
yet even these cases are not necessarily fatal.Thus, Jules Aron
reports from the epidemic at Joigny (1876) a case of recovery after
complete paralysis of the sphincter ani.The recognition and discharge
of an hepatic abscess relieves the patient from the dangers of this
complication.Peritonitis alarmingly aggravates the prognosis, and
perforation is almost of necessity fatal.PROPHYLAXIS.--The improved sanitation of modern times has already
diminished the frequency and mitigated the severity of epidemics of
dysentery; and this fact, which is only an accidental observation as it
were, gives the clue to the means of its further prevention.The selection of proper sites for camping-grounds, barracks, and
hospitals, the prevention of overcrowding in tenement-houses, ships,
and jails, the regulation of sewage, the care for the food and drink,
the observation of the strictest cleanliness by authoritative
control,--all these are general measures which suggest themselves in
the prophylaxis of this or any disease.In the management of individual cases the first precaution is to
prevent the dissemination of the disease.Whether it be really
contagious or not, every case should be managed, as Bamberger suggests,
as though it were contagious; and this protection of others secures for
the individual patient the most favorable hygiene.The bedding must be frequently changed; the windows kept open to secure
free ventilation, which, in the light of existing knowledge, is the
only true disinfectant; and all the furniture of the sick-room,
especially including the receptacles for the discharges, must be kept
perfectly clean.For this purpose the best purifier is very hot water.The temperature of the sick-chamber, if it be subject to regulation,
should never be allowed to sink below or rise above 65-70 degrees F.

The drinking-water should be secured, during an epidemic, from the
purest possible source, and if good drinking-water cannot be had, what
there is should be thoroughly boiled.The discharges should properly be mixed with sawdust or some
combustible substance and burned, or if this be impracticable should be
buried in the soil a few feet below the surface, and not emptied into
water-closets or privy-vaults used by others.Such articles of food should be abjured as have a tendency to produce
intestinal catarrh.So unripe fruits, vegetables which readily undergo
fermentation--in short, all indigestible substances--should stand under
ban.But no prohibition should be put upon ripe fruits or simple
nutritious food of any kind.Lastly, individuals should protect themselves from catching cold.The
{809} researches of Pasteur have disclosed the fact that certain germs
of disease will grow and multiply in the body of an animal whose
temperature is reduced, when they would not increase without it.TREATMENT.--The first requisite in the treatment of an individual case
is perfect rest.Patients with even the lighter forms of catarrhal
dysentery should observe the recumbent posture, and cases of more
serious illness should be put to bed.Rest in bed, an exclusive diet of
milk--which should always have been boiled--and the time of a few days
is sufficient treatment for the mildest cases.Where there is objection
to milk, meat-soups, with or without farinaceous matters, rice, barley,
etc., may take its place.A case which is somewhat more severe will require perhaps a light
saline laxative--a Seidlitz powder, a dose of Rochelle salts or Epsom
salts in broken doses--or a tablespoonful of castor oil or five to ten
grains of calomel, to effect a cure.For the relief of the pain of the
lighter cases nothing is equal to tincture of opium, of which five to
ten drops every three or four hours in a tablespoonful of camphor-water
acidulated with a few drops of nitric acid will generally suffice; or
Dover's powder in broken doses, one to three grains, with five to
fifteen grains of bismuth or soda, or both, is a good substitute for a
change.The successful treatment of dysentery in any form depends upon a
recognition of the fact that the disease is local as to its seat, and
is probably specific as to its cause.The anodynes relieve the effects,
but the laxatives remove the cause.Consequently, the most rational
treatment of the severer cases is the irrigation of the large intestine
and the thorough flushing out of its contents.The use of clysters in
the treatment of dysentery dates from the most ancient times, with the
object, however, rather of medicating than washing out the bowel.O'Beirne (1834) and Hare (1849) were the authors of the irrigation
treatment, which they executed by means of a long tube introduced into
and beyond the sigmoid flexure.Since Hegar has recently shown how the
whole tract of the large intestine can be thoroughly inundated and
flushed with a common funnel and rectal tube, the practice has
continually gained ground, until it is now admitted as the most
valuable method of treatment.H. C. Wood of Philadelphia, and later
Stephen Mackenzie of London, have reported a number of cases in which
irrigation of the bowel with large injections medicated with nitrate of
silver, drachm j-pint j, was attended with the most surprising
results--sometimes but a single injection effecting a cure; and the
writer of this article has reported one case almost in articulo mortis
where complete cure followed the irrigation of the bowel--on three
occasions with three pints of water containing three drachms of common
alum.This case was all the more instructive from the fact that a
relapse had occurred after very striking but only temporary relief had
been obtained with the nitrate of silver, the alum having been
substituted simply on the ground of expense.Salicylic acid has also been extensively employed in this way with the
best effects, but carbolic acid has been discarded since the reports of
several cases of poisoning have been published.Should it become a
question of the necessity of a parasiticide, the bichloride of mercury
in extremely dilute solution, 1 to 1000, would be the agent par
excellence; but it is probable that the simple flushing of the bowel is
the chief {810} curative agent.The use of alum is not attended with
the dangers which have ensued from the absorption of carbolic acid, and
which might ensue from the bichloride of mercury.The water used in the
injections should always be cold.Ice-water injections alone give at
times the greatest relief.Wenzel uses injections of ice-water in all
recent and acute cases, whether slight or severe--in bad cases every
two hours.The object is to
introduce as much water as possible without producing too much pain.The large intestine of an adult holds, on an average, six imperial
pints, but in the author's experience not more than three or four pints
can be safely introduced.The patient should lie upon the back or the
left side with the hips elevated and the head low, while the injection
is slowly introduced from a funnel, fountain, or a bulb syringe whose
nozzle is thoroughly anointed with vaseline.In the absence of a
thoroughly competent assistant the operation should be performed by the
physician himself, for the proper use of an irrigating enema is a
practice which requires both judgment and skill.When pain is
experienced, the further influx of the fluid should cease for a few
minutes, when it may be resumed again and again until the largest
possible quantity is introduced.It is impossible to over-estimate the
value of this treatment in cleansing, disinfecting, and constringing
the foul and flabby surface of the whole seat of the disease.As was
said by Hare, "It changes a huge internal into an external abscess, and
enables us to cleanse the bowel of its putrid contents."Of all the remedies which have been recommended in the relief of
dysentery besides the irrigation method, but one, ipecacuanha, deserves
the name of a specific.This remedy was first introduced into practice
in 1648 by the botanist Piso, who was led to adopt it from the popular
praise he had heard of it while travelling in Brazil.He considered it
the most exquisite gift of nature, and administered it in infusion
according to the Brazilian (subsequently known as the French) method.Legros made three successive voyages to South America to import
supplies of the drug to France, but neither he nor the French merchant
Grenier, who had brought over more than one hundred and fifty pounds of
it, could secure its general use.Thereupon, Grenier acquainted Adrian
Helvetius, a Dutch physician practising in Paris at the time, with the
wonderful virtues of the Radix dysenterica, who, having experimented
with it first upon patients of the lower classes, was later successful
in curing the Dauphin of France.The further use of it, by permission
of the king, at the Hotel Dieu, enabled him to secure a monopoly of its
sale and secured for him a grant of a thousand pounds.Grenier hereupon
put in his claim for a division of the profits, and upon the refusal of
Helvetius instituted suit to obtain his rights.Justly indignant at the
loss of his suit, he revealed the secret, and ipecacuanha became common
property at once.Extravagant ideas were now entertained of its value,
but in the extreme reaction which followed every virtue of it was
disavowed, so that the drug came to be almost forgotten.From this
temporary oblivion the remedy was rescued by an English army surgeon,
E. Scott Docker, in 1858, who administered it, in combination with
laudanum, in his regiment, on the island of Mauritius, in all cases and
stages of the disease with such success that out of fifty cases he lost
but one.Although such indiscriminate use and such almost unvaried
success has not attended, and from the nature {811} of different cases
could not attend, its universal employment, there is no doubt of the
inestimable value of the service rendered in the restoration of the
remedy in the treatment of dysentery.Yet over twenty years elapsed
before its author received from his country, at the urgent solicitation
of the Director-General, in recognition of this service, a grant of
four hundred pounds.Remarkable testimony as to its efficiency soon began to appear.Ewart[9] recommends ipecacuanha in every form and type of acute
dysentery, as well as in the acute attacks supervening upon chronic
cases.Its advantages are simplicity, safety, comparative certainty,
promptitude of action, decrease of chronic cases and of complications,
especially abscess of the liver, and great reduction of mortality."It
produces all the benefits that have been ascribed to bloodletting,
without robbing the system of one drop of blood; all the advantages of
mercurial and other purgatives, without their irritating action; all
the good results of antimony and other sudorifics, without their
uncertainty; all the benefits ascribed to opium, without irritating, if
not aggravating or masking, the disease."To the objections urged
against it he replies that the nausea is only temporary and
evanescent--that vomiting is exceptional and of but short duration;
moreover, it permits nourishment and assimilation and produces sleep.If uncontrollable sickness and vomiting occur, they are probably due to
abscess of the liver, malaria, some other cachexia, Bright's disease,
strumous mesenteric glands, hypertrophy of the spleen, peritonitis, or
extensive sloughing.[Footnote 9: _Indian Annals Med.Cunningham prefaces the treatment by a sinapism to the epigastrium and
half a drachm of the tincture of opium.Then from one to one and a half
drachms of ipecacuanha are administered in powder.It causes
considerable nausea, and vomiting occurs in one to two hours.During
the nausea copious perspiration breaks out, the pulse becomes fuller,
softer, and less frequent, the tenesmus and abdominal pains cease, and
the patient has no more stools for twelve to twenty-four hours.The
next evacuation is easy, fluid, but free from blood or mucus.Sometimes
the dose of ipecacuanha may require to be repeated.Malun reports the results of treatment of 436 cases occurring in
twenty-one months.There were only 6 deaths, and in only 1 of these
could the remedy be fairly said to have failed.Under all other plans
of treatment the mortality has varied from 12 to 22.3 per cent.Docker says that the mortality of dysentery in the British army
during the ten years that followed the adoption of the ipecacuanha
treatment fell from 11 to 5 per cent.The remedy is best administered in large doses, 20 to 40 grains, and
should be repeated every four to twelve hours until permanent good
effects are secured.A dose of 15 to 30 drops of tincture of opium, or
morphia, one-fourth grain hypodermically, will best protect the patient
from too great exhaustion.The beneficial results are mostly obtained
in the acute cases, though surprising results sometimes follow in cases
of very long standing.Thus, Gayton records a case of severe chronic
dysentery of eighteen months' duration which was entirely cured by
ipecacuanha, and probably most physicians of large practice can recall
cases where the continual relapses of the dysenteric habit have been
completely broken up by {812} one course of active treatment.Should
the remedy fail to be of service in the course of forty-eight hours, it
should be discontinued.Batiator, the bark of the root of the Ailanthus glandulosa; mudar, the
bark of the root of the Calotropis gigantea; and bael-fruit, more
especially in chronic cases,--have been proposed by Roberts, Duval,
Chuckerbutty, and others as substitutes for ipecacuanha, but are not
likely to soon supplant it.Materia medica is rich in drugs whose virtues have been vaunted in
dysentery, and cases occur where the judicious physician will make his
selection according to the indications in a given case.Turpentine
internally, as well as externally in the form of a stupe (Copland), has
had advocates from ancient times; astringents, tannic acid or the
substances which contain it, kino, catechu, krameria; the acetate of
lead, nitrate of silver, etc.; antiseptics, carbolic acid, salicylic
acid, boracic acid; anodynes, opium and its preparations; and
quinia,--are among the agents most frequently employed.Bonjean (1870) had occasion to laud the efficacy of ergotin in checking
hemorrhage and controlling the discharges in a report which
substantiates the claim of Rilliet and Lombard in the epidemic at
Geneva in 1853.Massolez had the same good results in the war of the
Crimea, as had also Andrea in the Spanish hospitals of Ceuta and
Tetuan.Clysters of nitrate of silver, 4 grains to 5 ounces of water (Duchs),
or with a few drops of tincture of opium (Berger); of ipecacuanha
(Begbie and Duckworth); of laudanum and starch (Sydenham, Abercrombie);
of the various astringents,--may be tried in obstinate, more especially
chronic, cases.Local inspection of the rectum by means of the speculum may possibly
reveal an ulcer, which is the chief or sole cause of the tenesmus and
bloody discharge.Maury reports such a case in which the ulcer was deep
enough to hide a small sponge.In such cases topical treatment may
effect a cure.Dilatation may suffice to overcome a stricture in the rectum, the
result of cicatricial contraction, or colotomy may be necessary in
cases more refractory or situated higher in the bowel.Post[10]
reported a successful colotomy, with the formation of an artificial
anus in the left lumbar region, in such a case.The food should be fluid, but nutritious, and milk best fulfils both
these requisites.Where milk cannot be tolerated it may be substituted
by soups, beef-tea, mutton-broths, chicken-soup, etc.But it should be
known of these substitutes that they contain little or no nutritious
matter on account of the insolubility of the albuminoids, and are
really only stimulants.Soft-boiled egg, thin custards, sweetbreads,
scraped or chopped raw beef--albumen thus in substance--constitute the
best food.But during the intensity of an attack the patient should
almost altogether abstain from food, both from lack of inclination for
it and from lack of ability to digest it.During convalescence the food
should be on the basis of animal diet, though ripe fruits and fresh
succulent vegetables should not be altogether withheld.In all cases of pronounced prostration stimulants are to be freely
used, and of all stimulants alcohol is the best, as it has also
nutritive and {813} antiseptic properties.Alcohol is thus triply
indicated in the treatment of dysentery, but the choice of the form and
strength will be a matter of judgment in the individual case.Where life is imperilled by hemorrhage or anaemia from any cause, a
forlorn hope is offered in transfusion, which in the hands of C.
Schmidt (1874) has proved successful in two cases.Abscess of the liver is best treated by aspiration or hepatotomy;
rheumatism, by the salicylates; and paralysis, by the constant current
of electricity.Obstinate cases of chronic or continually recurring dysentery are
thoroughly cured only by a sea-voyage, a sojourn at the seashore, a
mountain-excursion, or a permanent change of climate.{814}

TYPHLITIS, PERITYPHLITIS, PARATYPHLITIS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.HISTORY.--Typhlitis ([Greek: typhlos], blind), inflammation of or about
the head of the colon, more especially the vermiform process, is a
disease of modern recognition.Individual cases had been reported as
curiosities where foreign bodies or fecal accumulations had excited
inflammation in this part of the intestine, but it is undoubtedly to
Dupuytren[1] that the credit is due of having first individualized this
disease as a separate affection.About the same time (1827) Longer
Villermay published his communications in the _Archives gen._, t. v.246, on the diseases of the vermiform process, to be followed in the
same year by Melier[2] and Hussar and Dance with observations on
inflammation of the connective tissue in the region of the caecum.These affections, which had been hitherto described as inflammatory
tumors in the right iliac region, now received from Puchelt[3] the
distinct name perityphlitis.[Footnote 1: _Lecons oral de Cliniq.[Footnote 2: _Arch, gen._, Sept., 1827.][Footnote 3: _Heidelberg klin.Perhaps the most remarkable events in the history of these affections
since this time are the contributions of Stokes and Petrequin (1837) on
the value of opium in the treatment of perforation of the vermiform
appendix, of Albers,[4] who first distinguished the special form of
typhlitis stercoralis, and of Oppolzer (1858-64), who set apart,
perhaps as an unnecessary refinement in differential diagnosis, a
paratyphlitis, an inflammation of the post-caecal connective tissue.Matterstock[5] (1880) deserves especial mention for having given such
prominence to anomalies of the vermiform appendix in the etiology of
the affection; and Kraussold[6] (1881) has connected his name with the
therapy of the disease by the boldness with which he expresses his
convictions regarding the necessity of early evacuation, by incision,
of inflammatory products, as first practised by Willard Parker in 1843.aus dem Gebiete der Pathologie_, ii.[Footnote 5: _Handbuch d. Kinderkrank._, Bd.[Footnote 6: _Volkmann's Sammlung._, No.GENERAL REMARKS.--Typhlitis, strictly speaking, is limited to
affections of the caecum and its appendix vermiformis; perityphlitis is
mostly due to extension of the inflammation to the peritoneal envelope
of these organs; while paratyphlitis signifies an involvement of the
extra-peritoneal and post-caecal connective tissues.Both perityphlitis
and paratyphlitis are therefore secondary processes, though they may,
in exceptional cases, arise from affections of organs other than the
caecum, as from {815} perinephritis, psoitis, vertebral caries, or as
an expression of metastatic processes in pyaemia, septicaemia
(puerperal fever), typhoid fever, etc.ETIOLOGY.--Typhlitis and its allied affections or complications show
especial predilection for the male sex and the period of adolescence.Nearly three-fourths (733) of the whole number (1030) of cases of
perityphlitis collected from the literature by Matterstock were males,
and this proportion holds good in infancy and early youth as well as in
adolescence.The greatest number of cases, 33 per cent., occurred at
the ages of 21-30; next, 30 per cent., at 11-20; while the ratio
gradually decreases toward both extremes of life.So the opinion is
expressed with singular unanimity by all authors that these diseases
pre-eminently affect the bloom of life.The observation that typhlitis has so often been found to arise from
disease of the vermiform process has led to a closer study of its
anatomical relations, and developed the fact that this organ is subject
to great variation in size, shape, and situation.Normally, the appendix vermiformis arises from the posterior interior
aspect of the caecum as a tube of the diameter of a goosequill and a
length of three to six inches, with a general direction upward and
inward behind the caecum.It is commonly provided with a small
mesentery, which retains it in its place.Its cavity communicates with
the cavity of the caecum by a small orifice which is at times guarded
by a valvular fold of mucous membrane, while its free closed end
terminates abruptly in a blunt point.It is commonly found filled with
mucus throughout its entire length.The existence of this superfluous
structure, which is found only in man and certain of the higher apes,
has given rise to much speculation among the anatomists and
physiologists, especially of the teleological school, as to its
possible use.It is now, however, the generally acknowledged opinion
that the appendix vermiformis is a relic or rudiment of a subsidiary
stomach in lower forms of life.The head of the large intestine, which
forms almost an additional stomach in the Gramnivora, and is three
times the length of the whole body in the marsupial koala, is very much
reduced in the Carnivora, whose food contains but little indigestible
matter, and is greatly reduced in the Omnivora, as in man.The
vermiform appendix is the shrivelled remnant of the great caecal
receptaculum of the lower animals.In the orang it is still a long
convoluted tube, but in man it is reduced, as stated, to the size of a
quill three or four inches in length, and is often entirely absent.Kraussold, who complains that the vermiform process has hitherto
received only step-motherly treatment at the hands of anatomists and
clinicians, undertook a series of investigations which went to show how
often and what extreme anomalies do occur.In some cases the appendix
was disposed in an exactly opposite to the normal direction, its blind
end being turned upward along the ascending colon.In one case it was
found wound about the ileum; in another, spirally turned at its end and
lightly adherent to a hernial sac.Sometimes it was abnormally long or
short, open or closed with a valve, cylindrical, saccular, or bulbed,
fixed or free, curved or bent upon itself at a sharp angle, provided
with a short mesentery, and sometimes, as stated, it was entirely
absent.But by far the most interesting point connected with this organ was the
frequency with which it was found the seat of ulceration or stricture
{816} from cicatrization somewhere in its course, the result of
dysentery, typhoid fever, syphilis, and more especially of
tuberculosis.Clinicians who have been struck with the frequency with
which typhlitis has occurred in tuberculous subjects find in this
discovery a satisfactory explanation of this very remarkable
coincidence.Normally, the vermiform appendix is found filled, as stated, with a
tough vitreous mucus, but not infrequently masses of feces, foreign
bodies, intestinal worms, etc.find their way into it, where they may
remain innocuous or may excite a dangerous inflammation.This fact, in
connection with the general uselessness or superfluousness of this
structure, has led pathologists to characterize the vermiform process
with the significant appellation of a death-trap.Two anatomical factors deserve especial emphasis in explanation of the
frequent origin of disease in the vermiform appendix.One is the
existence of the valvular fold of mucous membrane, already mentioned,
at or near the orifice of the tube in the caecum, the clinical
importance of which was first pointed out by Gerlach.This fold is most
marked between the ages of three and twelve, and when pronounced
narrows the orifice to one-half or one-third of the whole calibre of
the tube.As a rule, this fold, and the consequent diminution in the
size of the orifice, are but little marked in the first years of life
and in old age, which accounts for the relative infrequency of
typhlitis at these periods of life.The second mechanical factor is the deformity caused by the abnormal
anatomical position of the organ, either as a congenital defect or as a
pathological change.Matterstock quotes from Zungel, who observed in 59
cases in the Hamburg hospital whole or partial obliteration 30 times,
catarrh and old fecal concretions 43 times, abnormal adhesions 12
times, and tubercular ulceration (without perforation) 11 times.Toft
claims as the result of 300 personal investigations that every third
person between the ages of twenty and seventy showed the traces of
present or past inflammation, and that actual ulceration existed in 5
per cent.Kraussold declares that this
percentage is rather too low than too high, and adds that among his
patients--who were, it should be stated, mostly phthisical--it was
remarkable how extraordinarily often the whole vermiform appendix was
the seat of an encroaching ulcer.In a number of cases cicatrices or
cicatricial alterations were found where typhoid fever or dysentery had
existed in the previous history.Attention should at least be called to a last anatomical factor in
explanation of the frequency of ulceration and inflammation of this
structure, in that its walls are so sparsely endowed with muscular
tissue as to render it unable to empty itself of the virus or germs of
disease which enter it from the comparatively stagnant reservoir, the
caecum.Constipation is usually invoked as a cardinal factor in the genesis of
typhlitis (typhlitis stercoralis).Speck calls attention to the
frequency of the disease in East Siberia, where the food, mostly
vegetable, contains a large amount of indigestible residue.But that
this condition cannot sufficiently account for the disease in most
cases is proved by the fact that constipation is more frequent in
advanced life and among females, in whom typhlitis with its associate
lesions is more infrequent.For the same reason a sedentary mode of
life loses force as an argument in its production.Perhaps the most
efficient cause of the condition is a local {817} paresis of the
muscular tissue of the caecum produced by the irritation of intestinal
catarrh, of disease virus, of a fecal concretion or a foreign body--an
irritation which may induce first a spasmodic action, and subsequently,
as a result, a partial paralysis or a paresis.The same condition may
be brought about more directly by the presence of a centre of
irritation--viz.Accumulation and
impaction of feces must then necessarily ensue, and it is highly
probable that this accumulation occurs in this way as a result more
frequently than as a cause of the condition.For the symptoms of a
simple accumulation of feces (coprostasis) are never so severe, at
least at the start, as to mark the onset of a genuine typhlitis.Nor is
there anything in healthy feces to induce the signs of a severe
blood-poisoning which so commonly announces the advent or course of
typhlitis.Room is here open for the surmise that most cases of typhlitis pur et
simple are due to the presence in the caecum of the germs or virus of
disease taken with the food or drink, and traversing innocuously the
whole length of the alimentary tract, to finally bring up in this most
stagnant part of the intestinal canal.The role of pure mechanical causes cannot be ignored or underrated in
perityphlitis, understanding by this division processes which commence
in the vermiform appendix.For it is the rule to discover in the
vermiform appendix in these cases either fecal concretions or foreign
bodies.Haeckel and Buhl found concretions of meconium in a new-born
child, and fecal concretions, intestinal stones, are far more
frequently encountered than foreign bodies.In 146 accurately observed
adult cases recorded by Matterstock, fecal concretions were met with 63
times, foreign bodies 9 times, while in the other cases nothing could
be discovered; and in 49 cases among children, fecal concretions were
discovered 27 times, foreign bodies 3 times, and nothing abnormal in
the remaining cases.Not infrequently a small foreign body acts as a
centre of crystallization for feces which become superimposed in
successive layers.Hairs, as of the beard, sometimes officiate in this
way.Among other foreign bodies met with in fatal cases of perforation,
independently of feces, may be mentioned round-worms (Faber),
cherry-stones (Paterson), needles (Payne), fish-bones (Zungel),
gall-stones (Hallete), a mass of ascarides (Klebs), buttons (Gerhardt),
etc., etc.As already intimated, supposed foreign bodies are often
found on examination to be nothing else than intestinal concretions.As
to cherry-stones, which are so often accused of producing typhlitis,
Biermer and Bossard found it difficult or impossible to force them into
the vermiform process.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions revealed upon the post-mortem table show
for the most part the ordinary picture of perforative peritonitis,
which is by far the most frequent cause of death.The peritoneum in the
vicinity of the perforation is found hyperaemic, swollen, necrosed,
covered with flakes of soft fibrin, or partially agglutinated to
contiguous structures.The wall of the bowel is very much thickened by
catarrhal swelling of its mucosa, proliferation of its submucous tissue
in more chronic cases, oedema of all its coats, or suppurative
processes.Not infrequently the mucous tissue is the seat of extensive
ulceration which may involve other structures of the gut or form an
abscess, even as large as a man's head, in its immediate vicinity.The
abscess may remain strictly localized or {818} may wander to discharge
itself into the ileum, caecum, duodenum, and diaphragm (Bamberger) with
resultant empyema (Duddenhausen), colon (Prudhomme), bladder (Bossard),
in which case the fecal concretion became the nucleus for a vesical
stone; acetabulum (Aubry), inferior vena cava (Demaux), or peritoneal
cavity, the most frequent eventuality.Duddenhausen saw in one case a
pylephlebitis result, Von Buhl a pylephlebitis and metastatic liver
abscess, which condition, Matterstock says, is noted 11 times in 146
autopsies; and older writers speak of discharges into the pleural sac,
into the lungs, pericardium, uterus, vagina, etc.A curious case was
observed by Eichhorst in Frerichs' clinic, where pus found escape
through the umbilicus.So cases of burrowing sinuses with abscesses at
distant seats, as in the groin or lumbar region, fistulae with
continuous discharge, and other curiosities, may be found among the
records by the curious.In cases of more acute course the lesions are often found centred about
the vermiform appendix.The most various contortions, adhesions, or
erosions are observed in this structure.Occasionally a constriction
occludes the course of the tube, while the distal end is dilated into a
condition of hydrops.It may be found perforated in one or in several
places.The cicatrices or agglutinations of old attacks may be
encountered; it may be cut in two or three pieces (Matterstock), or
have been entirely absorbed.Kraussold records a case of this kind in a
colleague who died of typhlitis.Upon the post-mortem table no trace of
the vermiform appendix could be encountered except a dimple on the
mucous surface of the caecum, indicating the site of its former
orifice.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Typhlitis announces itself in two ways--suddenly and
insidiously.In adults the disease begins as a rule with violent signs;
in children there is often a prodromatous stage which may last for days
or for months before a positive diagnosis can be established.There are
in these cases anorexia and vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea,
colicky pains, mostly concentrated about the ileo-caecal region.There
are at this time a disinclination to stand or walk, a stooped posture
or gait, occasionally a light icterus, a feeling of formication or
paresis in the right leg, and lastly an increased resistance or a
palpable tumor in the right ileum.In the adult the disease is wont to begin with more tempestuous signs.Not infrequently it is ushered in with a well-marked chill, upon which
immediately supervenes a sharp pain at the affected region.A general
collapse of strength soon follows, with fever, thirst, a husky voice, a
coated tongue, vomiting, singultus, and an expression of anxiety.The
impression of serious illness becomes apparent at once.The case early
bears the aspect of a grave infectious disease.A constant, dull,
boring, gnawing, or lancinating pain in the right iliac region first
excites the suspicion of the physician as to the real nature of the
disease.In children the pain is sometimes felt first in the
epigastrium; in three cases mentioned by Buchner, Herzfelder, and
Traube it was first experienced in the left ileum.There may be at this
time no tumor, but there is increased resistance to pressure and
exquisite tenderness to touch in the neighborhood of the caecum.The
whole abdomen is more or less tender, and often tumid.If there should
be also gurgling from displacement of gas, doubt is excited as to the
possible existence of typhoid fever.{819} In the course of a few days the tumor takes shape.A typhlitis
stercoralis shows a distension of the whole ascending colon, a
sausage-shaped tumor, smooth or nodulated, along the entire right side
of the abdomen, with increased resistance also in the transverse colon.More frequently in typhlitis--and, as a rule, in peri- and
paratyphlitis--the tumor or tumefaction is more localized about the
head of the colon.Frequently the swelling is so great as to be visible
as a protrusion or bulging of the affected region.Percussion shows
dulness, tanquam femoris, in cases of pure typhlitis, whereas in peri-,
and more especially in paratyphlitis, there is tympanites on light and
dulness only on deep percussion.Palpation or palpatory auscultation
occasionally, though very rarely, reveals a peritoneal friction sound
(Gerhardt).The third cardinal symptom of the disease is the disturbance of
digestion, which, as stated, often precedes or attends the first
manifestation of the pain and the tumor.Anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting--which is in the last stage of the disease often substituted
by singultus--present themselves as occasional or constant signs of the
disease.Constipation remains as a rule throughout the whole course of
the disease with an obstinacy which sometimes excites apprehension of
an intestinal occlusion; or the constipation may alternate with
diarrhoea or dysenteric phenomena, more especially in the earlier
stages.The tongue is, as a rule, heavily coated, or in typhoid states
is dry, glazed, or fissured, and sordes covers the teeth and gums.Fever is not a necessary factor in typhlitis, but when present
distinguishes itself by its irregular range.The pulse is usually
accelerated, full, and hard; the skin is dry and harsh; the urine is
scanty and high-, and contains "almost without exception
unusually large quantities of indican" (Eichhorst).Perforation, when it occurs, is usually recognized at once by the signs
of more or less immediate collapse, which quickly results in death.The abdomen becomes suddenly distended, meteoric over its entire
surface, the normal hepatic dulness giving place to a tympanitic
resonance.Not infrequently perforation occurs as the result of an accident, as
after a push or blow upon the abdomen (Volz), heavy lifting
(Volperling), riding in a wagon (Marsh), after dancing (Cless), mere
turning of the body in bed (Langdon Downs), after emesis (Urban),
purgation (Stokes), enema (Melier), etc., etc.That the slightest
agitation may suffice at times to break down the last barrier of serous
tissue separating the intestinal and peritoneal cavity is shown in the
case recorded by With, where fatal perforative peritonitis occurred
after a fit of immoderate laughter.Paratyphlitis distinguishes itself from the other forms of the disease
by its more insidious character.There is also in paratyphlitis, as a
rule, less disturbance in the alimentary canal.The caecum in
paratyphlitis is mostly empty or is filled with gas, whose presence is
recognized by tympanitic resonance on lighter percussion.On the other
hand, paratyphlitis is characterized by the greater frequency of
pressure signs in the right lower extremity.If the subjacent iliac and
psoas muscles be implicated, the thigh is flexed upon the leg in
decubitus.Various paraesthesiae, formication, numbness, pain, and
veritable paresis are experienced in the right leg.Dysuria, retraction
of the testicle, and priapism may also occur in this form of the
disease.Or pressure upon the iliac vein {820} induces thrombosis, with
oedema, milk leg.The long-continued process of suppuration in
paratyphlitis leads also at times to hectic fever or pyaemia, with slow
marasmus.In all cases relapses are very frequent, as repeated occurrences of the
disease constitute the rule.Eichhorst records the case of a
court-officer who suffered five attacks of paratyphlitis in the short
space of one and a half years.DIAGNOSIS.--The recognition of the disease is mostly simple.The pain,
the tumor, and the disturbances of digestion sufficiently, and for the
most part sufficiently early, distinguish the affection.Simple impaction of feces is differentiated by the history of
constipation; by the feel of the hardened feces, which form an
elongated, nodulated, sausage-shaped tumor along the entire ascending
colon, and later in shifting along the transverse colon; by the
comparatively slight tenderness; and by the entire relief which follows
thorough irrigation of the bowel.Cancer may be eliminated by regard of the age of the patient, the slow
development and course of the symptoms, and the gradual manifestation
of its cachexia.Invagination is an affection for the most part of early childhood--is
marked by the sudden appearance of violent symptoms of disturbance of
digestion, vomiting, often stercoraceous, occlusion, diarrhoea, or
dysentery, with straining and discharges of blood.DURATION.--Typhlitis and its complications have no definite duration.A
case may terminate fatally in the course of a few days or may extend
itself over months, or with its effects over years or for life.The
disease is, as a rule, much shorter in childhood than in adult life.According to Matterstock, nearly one-half (44 per cent.)of children
succumb to the disease within the first three days.Wood records the
case of a girl aged ten who died in nine hours.The average duration of
cases of typhlitis without suppuration ranges from fourteen to
twenty-one days.The early evacuation of inflammatory products by
aspiration or incision may cut the disease short at any time, or
exacerbations and remissions may manifest themselves for months or
years--a condition especially liable to occur when burrowing sinuses or
fistulae develop, or when passive encapsulated abscesses are aroused
into activity by some accident or indiscretion on the part of the
patient.PROGNOSIS.--A case of typhlitis stercoralis has no gravity, and should
terminate or be terminated within twenty-four to forty-eight hours
after its recognition.Neglected or unrecognized cases, however, are
not infrequently fatal from the circumscribed or more especially
diffuse peritonitis which may ensue.Typhlitis independent of fecal impaction is always a grave affection,
requiring in every instance a very guarded prognosis.Every form of typhlitis is more fatal in childhood than in adult life,
and any case of the disease may present grave complications or assume a
dangerous form at any time.The greater danger of childhood lies in the
greater liability to peritonitis.Most subsequent writers confirm this
statement, first made by Willard Parker, who also remarked that
suppurative processes, abscess formation, is more common in the adult.The mortality of perityphlitis alone in childhood is 70 per cent., in
adult life 30 per {821} cent., so that the proportion of recoveries is
exactly the reverse of these figures at the different periods of life.The general adoption of the opium treatment has, however, rendered the
prognosis of typhlitis far more favorable--has, in fact, reduced the
mortality in adult life from 80 per cent., the appalling figures of the
older statistics (Volz), to 30 per cent., the ratio of modern times.The means of earlier detection and readier relief of accumulated pus
have also contributed much to reduce the mortality of typhlitis.In
1872, Bull of New York had to report of 67 cases of perityphlitic
abscess collected by him, mostly treated without operation, a mortality
of 47-1/2 per cent., while ten years later (1882) Noyes of Providence
was able to report of 100 cases treated by operation a mortality of
only 15 percent.[Footnote 7: "Contribution to the Clinical Study of Typhlitis, etc.,"
_Trans.The development of fistulae or wandering abscess, the occurrence of
pyaemia and peritonitis, necessarily aggravate the prognosis of a
simple case.Perforation is fatal of necessity, yet cases are not
wanting where recovery has occurred even after this gravest of all the
accidents of the disease.Thus, Patschkrowski reports, from Frerichs'
clinic, a case of recovery after perforation, and Pepper mentions the
results of an autopsy made upon an old man who died of vesical
hemorrhage, in whom he "found that there had, at some unknown previous
time, been perforation of the appendix."PROPHYLAXIS.--The prevention of typhlitis has reference more especially
to cases of habitual recurrence of the disease in adults, or to the
earliest, prodromatous, stage in childhood.The slightest manifestation
of pain in the right iliac region should be looked upon with suspicion
in these cases, and absolute rest enjoined at once.Since in childhood
perforation has occurred in insidious cases after so slight an
irritation as a laxative or an enema, or even after a bath, every
provocation of this kind should be avoided.Injunction is to be put
upon all solid food in all cases in the inception as well as throughout
the course of the affection, that the element of coprostasis be not
superadded to the irritation of the disease.Adults subject to frequent
recurrences or relapses will thus avoid also the development or
aggravation of an intestinal catarrh, which in other cases of trivial
import may become dangerous to them.Many cases of typhlitis are
doubtless aborted at the start by the observance of absolute rest and
abstinence from food or rigid diet at the start.TREATMENT.--Perhaps no disease requires such careful consideration of
its cause or form, inasmuch as the different varieties call for
entirely different treatment.A typhlitis stercoralis, for instance,
requires an exclusive evacuant treatment, whereas a peri- or
paratyphlitis demands a treatment that shall put the bowels at rest.The safest and most effective method of emptying the caecum of impacted
feces is by irrigation of the bowels by means of the funnel syringe
devised by Hegar.The patient is put in the knee, elbow, or chest
posture, and warm water--which is the best solvent for hardened
feces--is allowed to slowly inundate the whole tract of the colon,
after the manner and with the precautions already pointed out in the
article on dysentery.Feeble or reduced patients should be supported in
this posture until as much water as possible is slowly introduced.As a
rule, a single thorough irrigation will suffice, or one or several
additional operations may be required {822} to secure the desired
effect.At the same time, broken doses, twenty grains, of sulphate of
magnesia may be administered every hour or two, not so much for the
purpose of exciting additional peristalsis as of turning water into the
intestinal canal from above.The other varieties of the affection call for opium at the start, with
the double view of preventing the irregular, spasmodic, or tetanic
contraction of the muscular coat and of obviating the danger of
peritonitis.Opium is not contraindicated in these cases, even if the
element of fecal impaction be superadded, as all clinicians are
familiar with the fact that the bowels will move of themselves at times
even under its full narcotic effects.The remedy is best given in fluid form, as in the tincture, that the
dose may be graduated in its repetition to secure its full effect
without danger.When a quick action is required, morphia hypodermically
may be preferred; yet it is to be remembered that opium with all its
active principles is of more value in the relief of peritonitis than
morphia alone.A careful watch should be kept upon all patients treated
with large or frequently-repeated doses of opium, that its toxic
effects be avoided.Not infrequently symptoms of poisoning have
supervened after a sudden relief of pain, necessitating the use of
means to keep the patient awake for a number of hours.Hot embrocations, or poultices applied over large surfaces of the
abdomen, give great comfort to the patient, though the very opposite
treatment of an ice-bag, occasionally shifted or suspended, is more
agreeable in some cases in the inception of the disease.So soon as a distinct doughy sensation or a more marked fluctuation
indicates the development of pus, steps should be undertaken at once to
secure its evacuation.In cases of doubt it is best to make a tentative
exploration with the needle of the aspirator, a large-sized needle
being preferred on account of the liability of occlusion with
tissue-shreds or other debris.It is quite surprising how rapidly a
case clears up at times after the evacuation of even only a drachm or
two of oedematous fluid.More frequently, however, the aspiration must
be repeated until a quantity of pus is secured and the abscess
completely discharged.An abscess of more superficial situation, of larger size, or of
continuous formation is best relieved by free incision.As to the time
of the operation, the old rule, ubi pus ibi incisio, holds good here as
elsewhere.An early evacuation of the products of inflammation prevents
the supreme danger of perforative peritonitis or the formation of
burrowing sinuses, fistulae, amyloid degeneration, and marasmus.Indurated tumors are sometimes made to soften under the long-continued
use of cataplasms, and chronic thickenings of the walls of the
intestine are relieved by general tonics, mild laxatives, mineral
waters, and gentle frictions with iodine or mercurial ointments.Perforative peritonitis calls for opium in maximum doses as a means of
facilitating possible agglutinations or encapsulations, and a forlorn
hope is offered in an early laparotomy, which the bolder surgeons are
now undertaking in the equally desperate cases of perforation by gall-
or kidney-stones, etc.Under no circumstances should a patient affected with typhlitis leave
the bed until the last trace of inflammation has subsided, as in no
disease is there greater liability to recurrence or relapse.{823}

INTESTINAL ULCER.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.Intestinal ulcer, Ulcus intestinorum entero-helcosis ([Greek:
helchosis], ulcer), represents a solution of continuity in the wall of
the intestine, affecting first, as a rule, its mucous coat.Ulcer of
the intestine, like ulcer of the stomach, its occasional congener and
not infrequent associate, is the expression of an insult or injury
offered to the intestinal coat in its inner exposed surface, or of a
necrobiosis the result of a local occlusion in the general
blood-supply.Hence, ulcer of the intestine may be a purely local
disease, or be the local expression of a general, so-called
constitutional, disease.While in many cases the lines differentiating
these conditions may not be distinctly drawn, as many so-called
constitutional conditions (tuberculosis, typhoid fever, etc.)are
discovered to be--at first, at least--local processes, the toxic ulcer
(arsenic, mineral acids) may be taken as a type of the local process,
acting from within, and the syphilitic ulcer as the type of the general
process, acting from without.At the same time, it must be recognized
of syphilis that an ulcer may result from the dissolution or breaking
down of a gummatous mass anywhere in the course of the intestine, or
may be the effect of infection by extension into the rectum of
syphilitic processes about the genital organs, or, lastly, of direct
introduction of the disease in perverted intercourse (pederasty, coitus
heterotopicus).Ulcer of the intestine is occasionally, though comparatively very
rarely, observed also as the result of pressure from within or without.Such an ulcer is properly considered of traumatic or mechanical origin,
as it is induced as the direct effect of mechanical irritation or
arrest of blood-supply.Thus, dense masses of inspissated feces,
foreign bodies, indigestible residue of food, may fret the mucous
surface into a condition of hyperaemia, and, later, absolute
ulceration.Undue retention, as behind a cicatricial contraction, or an
occlusion from whatever cause at places where the intestinal tube
normally offers resistance (at the ileo-caecal valve, sigmoid flexure,
etc.), may lead to ulceration in the same way.Schonlein has called
attention to the paralytic condition of the intestinal muscularis in
age as a predisposing cause of mechanical intestinal ulcer; and Virchow
has noticed the same condition among the insane, whose intense
preoccupation leads to neglect of evacuation of the bowels.Certain
intestinal parasites, more especially ascarides, are admitted as
occasional causes of ulceration, and more superficial solutions of
continuity in the rectum have been noticed as the result of too
frequent or too careless use of enemata.{824} Curling was the first to call attention to the fact that
extensive burns of the skin are sometimes followed by ulceration of the
intestines.The ulcerative process is almost exclusively confined to
the duodenum.Various attempts have been made to explain the intestinal
ulcer consequent upon burning of the skin, but a satisfactory
explanation is lacking as yet.Leube suggests an inhibition in the
force of the circulation by reason of accumulation of waste products in
the blood, while Billroth believes the ulcer to be the result of an
embolic process.Whatever the cause, the frequency of its occurrence
makes it more than a mere coincidence.According to Meyer, it is
observed most frequently in women, and shows its first symptoms in
seven to fourteen days after the initial burn.Aside from toxic and traumatic causes, ulcer of the intestine occurs as
the result of dysentery, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis--diseases
mentioned in the order of frequency in the production of intestinal
ulcer.The ulcers of dysentery in the large intestine, and of typhoid
fever in the small intestine, assume such prominence in these
affections--having even been erroneously considered at one time as the
cause of these maladies--that their study belongs to the history of
these diseases.The ulcer of tuberculosis is rather an accident in the
course of this affection, and is now recognized as the occasional
result of direct infection by the ingestion of tuberculous flesh, or,
far more frequently, of the deglutition of tuberculous sputum.As a
rule, the tuberculous ulcer shows itself late in the course of
pulmonary phthisis, and is the cause of the obstinate and colliquative
diarrhoea which speedily exhausts the patient.Yet cases are
occasionally met in which numerous or extensive ulcers occur in the
intestinal canal early in the history of phthisis, before any serious
damage has been inflicted upon the lungs.The tuberculous ulcer
affects, and for the most part is confined to, the same structures
which form the seat of disease in typhoid fever--viz.the solitary and
agminated glands of the ileum.When the bacilli tuberculosis are
conveyed to the intestine by means of the lymph- and blood-supply
through the mesenteric vessels, the resulting ulcer takes the shape of
the vascular arrangement; that is, the long axis of the ulcer is at
right angles to the course of the tube.Thus, if sufficiently
extensive, the ulcer may be circular or form a girdle or ring entirely
around the tube.With the tubercular ulcer or ulcers are usually found
tubercular nodules or plaques in the serous coat, which are visible to
the naked eye as opacities or milky deposits beneath the peritoneal
coat.The glands of the mesentery may be at the same time so much
increased in size as to form visible or palpable tumors in the abdomen.The frequency with which tuberculosis affects the vermiform appendix
has already been noticed in detail in the etiology of perityphlitis.The ulcer of the intestine which is the result of a catarrhal process,
so called, belongs to the history of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery.The true intestinal ulcer, per se, which has its analogue in the
stomach as the gastric ulcer, ulcus rotundum, is due to the same cause
as in the stomach--viz.to arrest of circulation and erosion by the
gastric juice.It is a well-established fact in physiology that gastric
digestion is continued--is, indeed, mainly effected--in the small
intestine; hence it is not surprising to learn that an arrest of
circulation in the small intestine {825} is attended by the same
result.The fact that this so-called peptic ulcer is found almost
exclusively in the duodenum speaks most emphatically for this origin of
the disease.Arrest of the circulation in the intestinal wall may be
due to embolus, which, according to the observations of Nothnagel and
Parenski, is not infrequently found in the branches of the duodenal
artery; to infarction, the condition so commonly encountered in pyaemia
and septicaemia; or to thrombotic occlusion, as seen in amyloid
degeneration--a disease process which selects by preference the vessels
of the alimentary canal, along with those of the kidney and spleen.The duodenal resembles the gastric ulcer in form as well as origin.It
has the same appearance, in its recent stage at least, of having been
cut out with a punch, shows no inflammation, induration, or thickening
about its borders, and presents the same funnel-shape with terraced
walls, its apex below eccentrically situated, as a rule corresponding
to the situation of the artery.It is most frequently found in the
upper horizontal portion of the duodenum, but is occasionally, though
rarely, seen in the descending portion.In the further course of the
duodenum the gastric juice becomes gradually neutralized, so that
ulcers situated below the orifice of the gall-ducts are very great
exceptions.In Krauss' collection of 47 cases but 2 were found in the
lower sections of the duodenum.The intestinal like the gastric ulcer
is usually found single or alone, but occasionally two, three, or even
four ulcers are encountered.According to the tables of Morot, a single
ulcer is found in 81.8 per cent.of cases, two in 9.2 per cent., and
three and four in 4.5 per cent.Duodenal like gastric ulcers are attended with the liability to
hemorrhage and perforation in equal if not greater degree.There is
also the same tendency to implication of contiguous structures.Stich
records a case of perforation of the aorta; Eichenhorst mentions the
formation of abnormal communication with the gall-bladder; and
Frerichs, a thrombosis of the vena porta in consequence of duodenal
ulcer.Lastly, the process of cicatrization may be followed by the same
disasters as occur in pyloric ulcers in consequence of contraction and
constriction.Thus, the orifices of the pancreatic or choledochus ducts
may be narrowed or completely closed, or the whole lumen of the
duodenum obliterated, with consecutive dilatation of the stomach and
oesophagus, as in the case narrated by Biermer.A very nice question in
differential diagnosis as between pyloric carcinoma and pyloric or
duodenal ulcer is sometimes raised in this way.In the vast majority of
cases it is safe, even in the absence of a palpable tumor and without
regard to the age of the patient, to decide this question in favor of
carcinoma.Cases of complete occlusion constitute the rule in
carcinoma, and the very great exception in ulcer.It remains to be said that duodenal is much more rare than gastric
ulcer, in the ratio of 1 to 30, and that, unlike gastric ulcer, it
chiefly affects males.According to the statistics of Krauss, already
cited, the ratio of males to females is 9 to 1, and according to Trier
the ratio is 5 to 1.It occurs in greatest frequency between the ages
of thirty to forty, diminishing in frequency with advancing age.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Ulcer of the intestines announces itself by symptoms
which are, as a rule, much more vague and indefinite than the same
process in the stomach.In a certain percentage of cases the symptoms
{826} may be entirely latent, and the cause of a sudden death be
revealed only on the post-mortem table.In less severe cases the entire
symptomatology of intestinal ulcer is grouped under the term dyspepsia,
no characteristic phenomena being manifest throughout the course of the
disease.On the other hand, a very small ulcer may give rise to the most
dangerous symptoms--hemorrhage and perforative peritonitis, which may
be even fatal in the course of a few days or hours.Among the symptoms that appear with prominence in the course of the
disease is pain.Although cases are abundantly on record marked by the
entire absence of pain, and although pain is by no means so universally
present as in gastric ulcer, it occurs in the great majority of cases
of ulcer of the intestine.The pain of intestinal ulcer distinguishes
itself from gastric ulcer by being more independent of the character of
the food or the time of taking it.For the most part, it occurs in
attacks of colic, which are characterized at times by their extreme
severity, long duration, and obstinacy to every means of relief.These
attacks occur in paroxysms with complete or only incomplete remissions,
and are ascribed, as in gastric ulcer, to the erosive action of the
gastric juice upon exposed nerve-fibres, the intervals of relief
corresponding to the periods of exhaustion of the nerve-centres.At the
same time, in exceptional cases, a long-continued localized tenderness
to pressure may indicate the seat of the disease.Palpation may elicit, besides tenderness, points or regions of
induration or intumescence.Such a condition is more especially
encountered in cases of tuberculous disease, the so-called scrofula of
the intestine or the tabes mesenterica of childhood.More localized
enlargements are occasionally to be felt in the vicinity of the
duodenal or other intestinal ulcer in consequence of circumscribed
peritonitis, with its resultant agglutinations and adhesions.In this
connection caution must be exercised not to confound masses of impacted
feces with tumefactions.The history of constipation or the
administration of a light laxative will generally suffice to remove
this source of error.Anorexia is a symptom of intestinal ulcer as a rule.The loss of
appetite may amount to a complete aversion to all food or only to the
more fatty articles of diet.A curious exception to this rule is not
infrequently seen in the unappeasable hunger of children the victims of
tuberculous ulceration.The contrast offered in the extreme emaciation
of these patients has been made the subject of frequent comment.With this loss or perversion of appetite and defective digestion of the
food, the general condition soon begins to fail.Though cases are
occasionally met in which a bien-etre has been maintained for years, or
a condition of obesity has been retained, these cases form the
exception in the history of intestinal ulcer.More or less emaciation
gradually develops as a rule, and a reduction of the general strength
that is out of all proportion in its degree to the loss of flesh.At
the same time the mental condition of the patient suffers a degradation
to the level of the sufferer with chronic dyspepsia.The disturbances of digestion which occur in intestinal ulcer present
many varieties in degree and kind.Some patients show none or but few
of the signs, while others run the gamut, so to speak, in the
semeiology of dyspepsia.Heartburn, eructations, pyrosis, borborygmi,
flatulence, gastralgias, pseudo-anginas, nausea, and vomiting, the
familiar {827} phenomena of gastric or intestinal catarrh, attend at
some time or other in the course of the disease most of the cases of
intestinal ulcer.The condition of the discharges demands notice in detail, more
especially as abnormalities in the evacuations belong among the few of
the more constant symptoms of the disease.Diarrhoea is the rule in intestinal ulcer.The discharges consist at
first of the undigested food and the digestive juices, which have been
hurried along the alimentary canal and prematurely evacuated on account
of the increase of peristalsis caused by the irritation in the upper
part of its tract.The arrest of the digestive process leads to early
decomposition of the ingested matters, and thus imparts to the
discharges an exceedingly offensive odor.While, in exceptional cases,
constipation may be present, or even obstipation of the bowels, the
discharges are usually so abundant as to constitute a diarrhoea, which
in some cases is so frequent or profuse as to become colliquative and
speedily exhaust the strength of the patient.An ulceration situated in the colon or rectum would furnish the
discharges characteristic of dysentery, already described in detail,
while the same process in the ileum would show the evacuations
characteristic of typhoid fever or tuberculosis.The most characteristic ingredient of the true duodenal ulcer is blood.As stated in the article on HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS, ulcer of the
intestine constitutes the most frequent source of this accident, which
is sometimes so grave as to destroy life in the course of a few days or
hours.The blood from an intestinal ulcer may be evacuated both by the
mouth and the anus, or may be retained in the alimentary canal and not
appear at all.Such cases constitute the condition known and described
under the heading of occult or concealed hemorrhage, which is
recognized by the rapid general collapse of the patient.When the blood
issues from a duodenal ulcer, it is intimately commingled with the
contents of the alimentary canal.The discharges in such cases are
usually black, tarry, and more or less fluid; whereas blood from the
colon or rectum still preserves its fresh red color and is discharged
separate from the feces or simply coats its exterior.Occasionally
cases are met where the blood coagulates in the interior of the
intestinal canal, to form a cast of its lumen or to accumulate in great
mass in the sigmoid flexure or rectum.In one case in the experience of
the author such an accumulation was the cause of a very severe
tenesmus, which was only relieved by the digital evacuation of large
masses of inspissated, coagulated blood.The presence of pus would indicate lesion of the colon, as typically
shown in dysentery, as suppuration, at least with any visible products,
does not occur in ulcer of the duodenum.DURATION.--Ulcer of the intestine has no definite duration.As in the
case of its prototype, gastric ulcer, it may speedily be covered with
cicatricial tissue and never appear again in the course of a long life.But such a course is as unusual as in gastric ulcer.Frequent
recurrence constitutes the rule in intestinal ulcer, or a partial
recovery with frequent relapses, as in the course of ulcer of the
stomach.So ulcer of the intestine is not infrequently a lifetime
malady, with exacerbations and remissions dependent largely upon the
prudence or imprudence of the patient with regard to diet.It need
hardly be stated that ulcer of the intestine {828} may terminate
fatally even in the course of a few days from hemorrhage, circumscribed
and later diffuse peritonitis, or may drag out a slow length of years,
to finally destroy the patient with the general symptoms of inanition,
hydrops, and marasmus.DIAGNOSIS.--From what has been already stated, it is seen that ulcer of
the intestine is often entirely overlooked or may be readily confounded
with other maladies of the digestive tract.Cases of traumatic or toxic
origin are generally readily recognized by the history of the patient,
and tuberculosis reveals itself by the youth of the individual, the
existence of the disease elsewhere, the gradual emaciation, the
premature senescence--in short, the general signs of the phthisical
habitus, the meteorism, and perhaps the presence of nodular
enlargements of the mesenteric glands.The most characteristic symptom of the peptic ulcer is, as has been
stated, hemorrhage.But hemorrhage is present in only the minority of
cases, is, as a rule, occasional and transitory, and is at all times
difficult of differentiation as to its source.Blood from a gastric
ulcer may also be voided per rectum as well as per os, and the blood
from a duodenal ulcer after regurgitation may be wholly discharged by
vomiting.The absence of vomiting and the presence--more especially the
persistence--of tarry evacuations from the bowels would speak for ulcer
of the intestine.Dilatation of the duodenum, a condition of ectasia,
closure of the bile-duct with consecutive jaundice, or the presence of
fatty stools from occlusion of the pancreatic duct (a sign not now
regarded of the same value as in the days of Bright), would also
declare in favor of ulcer in the duodenum.As between intestinal ulcer and catarrh or intestinal ulcer and
carcinoma, precisely the same rules would hold as in the case of the
stomach.A simple enteralgia would be recognized by its more frequent
occurrence among females or individuals of neurotic temperament; by its
connection with faults of diet, malaria, or exposure to cold; by the
absence of hemorrhage, diarrhoea, or peritonitis.PROGNOSIS.--Too much caution cannot be exercised in the prognosis of
ulcer of the intestine; for even in the cases which run a perfectly
mild course the gravest, even fatal, accidents are liable to occur.The
danger of perforation in cases of typhoid fever from a single or from
one of the few ulcers that may be present imparts one of the chief
elements of gravity to this disease; and the same catastrophe may occur
at any time in dysentery or tuberculosis.The duodenal ulcer may
likewise have a sudden gravity imparted to a mild case by a copious
hemorrhage or a peritonitis, and, even though the patient escape all
possible complications, to recover with the surface of the ulcer healed
so that the loss of substance is filled in with firm cicatricial
tissue, the danger of contraction or stenosis still remains.The ulcers
of dysentery in the colon and of syphilis in the rectum are especially
liable to be followed by deformities of this kind, while the
tuberculous ulcer in the ileum not infrequently results in a more or
less complete stenosis.The ulcer of typhoid fever in its cicatrization
almost never reduces the size of the intestinal canal.TREATMENT.--The most valuable therapeutic means of relieving the pain
and obviating the dangers of ulcer of the intestine consist in the
{829} regulation of the diet.The food should be light, easily
digestible, and during the acute stage of the disease as nearly fluid
in its consistency as may be.Milk would be the staple article of diet
in all cases were it not for the fact that in some cases constipation
attends its too exclusive use.The various soups, without solids,
broths, preparations of starch (sago, arrowroot, tapioca, etc.), may
sufficiently nourish the patient until the healing process shall have
commenced.Raw beef, chopped up and made into an emulsion, is perhaps
the most nutritious and least injurious of any kind of food.Bread,
potatoes and other vegetables should be ruled out altogether, because
of their liability to produce masses of feces whose inspissation may do
mechanical damage to ulcers in process of cicatrization.Where there is failure in the general strength early resort should be
had to alcohol, which may be administered in the form of red wine (in
preference to white, because of the tannin it contains), wine-whey, or,
in more serious prostration, of sherry wine, milk punch, egg-nog made
with good whiskey or brandy.In the worst cases, where all food irritates, feeding by the mouth may
be abandoned altogether for a time, and the strength of the patient
sustained by nutritive enemata of beef or pancreatic emulsion.The diarrhoea should be controlled rather than entirely checked, for
fear of the greater evil of constipation.A little bismuth with
bicarbonate of sodium or oxide of zinc may suffice for the milder
cases, while in the more aggravated cases resort must be had sooner or
later to opium.Constipation is best relieved by careful injections of warm water or by
the administration of the lighter laxatives--mineral waters, Seidlitz
powders, citrate of magnesia, castor oil, etc.Vomiting is combated by ice, soda-water, champagne, cherry-laurel
water, and in graver cases morphia hypodermically.Pain may be relieved by applications of hot water, cataplasms,
injections of hot water, and, when necessary, by morphia with or
without belladonna.Hemorrhage is checked by ice internally and externally, turpentine,
ergot or preferably ergotin by hypodermic injection, and opium.Peritonitis, more especially perforative peritonitis, calls
imperatively for the liberal use of opium.Patients the victims of intestinal ulcer must maintain a guarded diet
for months, often for years, after all signs of the disease have
disappeared as the best prophylaxis against recurrence.Constant
vigilance is also required to avoid constipation, and the greatest
temperance exercised with regard to the use of alcohol.The author has
at the present time a patient under treatment who presents all the
symptoms of duodenal ulcer, including hemorrhage, with every indulgence
in strong drink, and in whom all symptoms disappear under entire
abstention.Sometimes a course of mineral waters, a sea-voyage, or
other change of life or scene constitutes the best means of avoiding
frequent relapse.It need hardly be said that an ulcer in the rectum, which is readily
recognized by its attending tenesmus, calls for local treatment; and it
is equally plain that tuberculosis or syphilis requires appropriate
internal means of relief.{830}

HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.GENERAL REMARKS.--Hemorrhage of the bowels occurs in both sexes, though
more frequently in the male, and at all ages, though more frequently at
the middle period of life.In the infant a form of it is sometimes
considered as a distinct affection under the head of melaena
neonatorum, and in age it sometimes shows itself as a distinct sign of
a disease characteristic of age--namely, cancer.According to the
tables of Bamberger, it is caused in the order of frequency by
dysentery, typhus fever, cancer (of the colon), mechanical injury,
poisons and foreign bodies, ulceration (tubercular, follicular), the
round ulcer of the duodenum, and aneurism; last and least frequent is
the so-called vicarious hemorrhage.ETIOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the intestinal canal arises from (1)
anomalies in the contents of the bowel; (2) disease of the wall of the
bowel; and (3) from general diseases.(1) The inspissation of the natural contents of the bowel during
long-standing or habitual constipation may convert the feces into dense
masses which irritate and scratch the mucous membrane, and thus induce
hemorrhage directly by simple solution of continuity, or indirectly as
the result of extreme hyperaemia.Such hemorrhage is nearly always
slight, streaking or coating the surface of the scybalous mass or being
extruded from the anus as a small deposit of blood during the last act
of defecation; in which latter case it is found mostly associated with
hemorrhoids or fissure of the anus--conditions which require separate
description.Independent of these conditions, the hemorrhage nearly
always has its origin in the lowest regions of the large intestine,
where condensation of the feces is naturally greatest.Foreign bodies in the intestinal canal descended from the stomach may
also be the cause of hemorrhage in the same way.Thus, stones of
fruits, bones of fish, fragments of oyster-shell, or other substances
in no way connected with aliments (false teeth, buttons, pins and
needles, etc.), may be swallowed accidentally or purposely (as by
children or the insane) to produce intestinal hemorrhage.Drastic
cathartics (podophyllin, gamboge, etc.)and poisons (arsenic, mineral
acids) occasionally act in the same way.Thus, Tardieu reports[1] the
case of a servant to whom was administered by a homoeopath veratrin
with coffee, with fatal effect in six days.At the autopsy, made by
Amussat and Reymond, the stomach and small {831} intestine were found
filled with a dark-brown or black bloody fluid, but there was no trace
of perforation, ulceration, or organic disease.[Footnote 1: _Annales d'Hygiene_, July, 1854.]Under this head mention should be made also of certain parasites whose
habitat is the intestinal canal, the walls of which they perforate.Two
varieties, the Anchylostoma duodenale and the Distoma hepaticum, are
frequent causes of hemorrhage, the former from the duodenum and
jejunum, the latter from the rectum, in hot climates, more especially
in India and Egypt.(2) Anomalies in the intestinal walls produce hemorrhage as the result
of intense hyperaemia (per diapedesin) or of actual loss of substance
(per rhexin).Copious, even fatal, hemorrhage has thus ensued from
dysenteric and typhoid processes (and even without discoverable cause)
where no ulceration or loss of substance could be discovered on
autopsy; and this accident is so frequent as the result of ulceration
in the diseases mentioned as to constitute a characteristic sign or
complication.It must be said, however, that cases of alarming or fatal
hemorrhage without apparent cause during life or lesion after death
were more frequently reported in the literature of the times preceding
our more accurate knowledge of pathology and pathogeny.Few clinicians
or pathologists would now be content with reports made without full
knowledge of the history of the case or microscopic examination of the
intestinal walls.Thus, the report to the Societe Medicale d'Emulation,
April 2, 1834, by Dubois of a young man who quickly died of intestinal
hemorrhage five days after a severe headache, and on the same occasion
by Guillemot of several similar cases, would awaken the suspicion of
masked typhoid fever; and the case of an old man aged seventy-four who
died of intestinal hemorrhage after four days' diarrhoea, reported by
Husson,[2] would call for a close examination of the vessels in the
intestinal walls.In fact, Bricheteau, who reported a case from the
Hopital Neckar, was able on autopsy to discover a rupture in a small
artery of the intestines.[Footnote 2: _Proceedings of the Anatomical Society at Paris_, 1835.]Embolic processes leading to the formation of ulceration (by
predilection in the duodenum) are often attended with intestinal
hemorrhage, which would be more constantly present were it not for the
fact that, as in the stomach, the speedy establishment of collateral
circulation prevents the consequences of complete infarction.Besides dysentery and typhoid fever, tuberculosis and syphilis are
occasional causes of ulceration and necrosis of the intestinal walls
which may be attended with hemorrhage.Cancer of the intestine most
frequently affects the rectum, but wherever situated may show
hemorrhage as one of its signs.The local hyperplasia of the mucous tissue which constitutes a
polypus--and which in children, in whom it most frequently occurs, is
mostly situated in the rectum--is suspected to exist or is recognized
by the frequent discharge of blood from the bowels.A far more grave
affection of the intestinal walls, likewise most frequent in childhood,
is the peculiar dislocation known as intussusception or invagination.This condition is so commonly attended with distressing evacuations of
blood and mucus as to simulate dysentery.The strangulation of the
intussuscepted mesentery with its vessels easily accounts for the
hemorrhage in such cases.A more extensive compression is exercised at times by tumors in the
{832} abdominal cavity, as by pregnancy, ovarian growths, etc.,
occlusions in the course of the portal system (cirrhosis hepatis),
interference with the general circulation, as in diseases of the heart
or lungs, with intestinal hemorrhage as a consequence.Diseases of the blood-vessels themselves, as amyloid degeneration,
aneurism, should not be omitted from the list of factors possibly
productive of this result.(3) The general diseases attended with hemorrhage from the bowel are
characterized for the most part by more or less general disintegration
or dissolution of the blood, with the manifestation of hemorrhage in
various parts of the body--kidneys, uterus, subcutaneous tissue, etc.;
the enterorrhagia being an accidental localization, so to speak, of the
effusion.The most prolific causes of this disorganization are the
micro-organisms which "touch the life of the blood corruptibly;" and
hence the various acute infectious diseases may show in the severer
forms hemorrhage from the bowels.Under this head may be ranged
variola, which boasts even of a hemorrhagic form; typhus, yellow, and
malarial fevers; the forms of nephritis marked by uraemia, cholera,
icterus gravis, erysipelas, etc.Disintegration of the blood or partial
dissolution of its corpuscular elements occurs also in those obscure
affections which constitute the group, or are included in the
description, of the hemorrhagic diatheses, as haemophilia, leuchaemia,
pernicious anaemia, scurvy; of any of which enterorrhagia may be a
distinct or dangerous sign.Melaena neonatorum is the distinct name given to a hemorrhage from the
bowels which occurs a few hours or days after birth, and which is often
so profuse as to cause death at once or in a short time.In most cases
no anatomical lesions can be discovered after death, save an intense
hyperaemia of the intestinal mucosa, so that the etiology of this
affection is involved in obscurity.The various causes assigned in its
production--ulceration of the stomach or duodenum (Bohn), embolism
(Landau), fatty degeneration (Steiner), premature ligature of the
umbilical cord (Kiwisch)--answer only for individual cases.Betz
reported a case in a family subject to haemophilia, and Trousseau once
saw twins thus affected; but that heredity cannot account for all cases
is shown by the fact that it occurs mostly in healthy children from
healthy parentage.Klebs is inclined to attribute the affection to the
action of micro-organisms, introduced perhaps as the result of
puerperal infection, but this cause can be assumed in only a small
minority of cases; at least, but a small percentage of cases coincide
with puerperal disease on the part of the mother.Eichhorst states that Hecker
observed it but once in 500 births, and Gemich but once in 1000 births.According to Rilliet, the hemorrhage is oftener (8/14) intestinal,
rarer (4/14) gastric, and rarest (2/14) both.It is almost always
abundant and quickly repeated, the blood being mostly pure, in clots or
masses and fluid, though it is sometimes commingled with meconium.It
usually ceases within twenty-four hours, though it may continue for
three, five, or more days.Of 23 cases reported by this author, 12
recovered and 11 died.MORBID ANATOMY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels, being only a symptom of
very many different conditions, is marked by lesions characteristic of
the condition in an individual case.These lesions are more
appropriately described in connection with the various diseases.Not
{833} infrequently in these cases the intestine is distinguished by the
absence of any lesion at all; but, from whatever cause, hemorrhage from
the bowels, like hemorrhage from any other source, shows a more or less
profound anaemia of all the internal organs, and in more chronic and
protracted cases leads to fatty degeneration, more especially of the
heart.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels is usually readily
recognized by the discharge of blood, either pure or mixed with the
natural contents of the alimentary canal.The actual seat of the
hemorrhage may, however, only rarely be recognized by the rectal
speculum.The colicky pains, borborygmi, or sensations of fluids in the
abdomen which are occasionally experienced may not be relied upon in
fixing the seat of the effusion.Should the hemorrhage occur in
quantity, or, more especially, should the seat of the effusion be low
in the intestinal canal, the blood which escapes is more or less pure.When the hemorrhage is higher, or when the stay of the blood in the
bowel is longer, it becomes more or less incorporated with the contents
of the bowels or altered by the intestinal juices to present a
discharge of mushy or semi-fluid consistence, of dark-brown or black
color.So-called tarry stools are thus largely composed of blood.But serious, even fatal, hemorrhage sometimes occurs without the escape
of any blood at all.Such are the so-called cases of concealed, occult,
or internal hemorrhage, in which the nature of the malady is only
suspected or recognized by the general symptoms attending the profuse
loss of blood.Should the hemorrhage be gradual, anaemia slowly
supervenes, with hydraemia and subcutaneous dropsy.Traube reports a
fatal case of oedema of the glottis from such a cause.Sudden
hemorrhage announces itself by pallor and prostration, dyspnoea,
vertigo, and syncope.Amaurosis, tinnitus aurium, formication, emesis,
and, if the disease be high up in the intestinal canal, haematemesis,
are the common attendants of serious hemorrhage.In the worst cases of
sudden effusion the patient may present the appearance of complete
collapse, and the intestinal canal be found on autopsy distended with
blood throughout a great part of its course, while no blood whatever
has escaped from the rectum.In such cases, or with more gradual loss
of blood, the patient experiences a sense of increasing weakness, the
skin becomes cold and bedewed with a clammy sweat, the pulse grows
feebler, the temperature falls, and death from exhaustion more or less
speedily ensues.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of blood in any quantity in the stools is
readily recognized by its coarser characteristics.Ridiculous errors
have been made by mistaking the coloration produced by bismuth, iron,
logwood, etc.administered internally, or by coloring matters
introduced into the discharges for purposes of deception.The
microscope, Zeichmann's test for blood-crystals, and in extremely
doubtful or medico-legal cases the spectroscope, furnish easy means of
detecting blood in whatever quantity or character.It is the cause and seat, rather than the existence, of the hemorrhage
that mostly cause embarrassment in differential diagnosis.Hemorrhage
from the lungs, nose, or stomach is usually readily excluded by the
absence of any evidence of disease of these organs, and the presence of
the other symptoms of any general disease attended with enterorrhagia
makes a diagnosis in most cases easy enough.Alterations in the
contents of the {834} bowel, the presence of foreign bodies, are
recognized by the history of the case and by careful local examination,
while a diagnosis of anomalies in the walls of the bowel is usually
reached by exclusion.In no doubtful case should local inspection or
digital examination of the anus and rectum be omitted.TREATMENT.--As in all cases of hemorrhage, the first requisite is
absolute rest.The patient should be at once put to bed and kept
perfectly quiet.Many a case of hemorrhage in typhoid fever is produced
by arising from bed to go to stool.The bed-pan is an absolute
necessity in the management of a case of typhoid fever after the second
week of the disease.Rest is the chief agent in prophylaxis as well as
therapy.The most effective styptic in enterorrhagia is cold.An ice-bladder
should be laid upon or suspended immediately above the abdomen during
the whole duration of the flow.The injection of ice-water into the
bowel should be practised only in cases where the hemorrhage is
believed to come from the colon.Otherwise, the peristalsis it awakens
may only aggravate the danger.Should rest and cold fail to quickly
check the hemorrhage, resort should be had at once to ergot.This
remedy, in the form of ergotin, is most effective when introduced
beneath the skin.In cases of less imminent danger the practitioner may
be content to give the remedy by the mouth.Small doses of the simple or camphorated tincture of opium frequently
repeated speedily arrest contractions of the bowel, and at the same
time feed the brain in threatening syncope.The astringents
proper--tannic acid or its preparations, acetate of lead, alum, the
perchloride of iron--are seldom necessary or advisable, but may be
called for in obstinate or protracted cases.To turpentine has been ascribed, from time immemorial, specific virtues
in relief of hemorrhage of the bowels, and its administration is still
a routine system with many older practitioners.It is most effective in
large doses--one drachm, with milk or in emulsion, every hour or two
until the hemorrhage ceases.In relief of collapse, alcohol, ether, and musk are imperatively
indicated, with the external application of heat; and in the treatment
of the anaemia and hydraemia the preparations of iron, including,
later, the mineral waters which contain it.In the worst cases of
sudden alarming hemorrhage the physician should not fail to practise
the transfusion of blood or solutions of salt or soda.Milk is the best food and drink during the attack, and after it for
some days or weeks.Chopped or scraped raw beef may substitute it
later, while all farinaceous foods are to be strictly avoided for some
time.{835}

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION.BY HUNTER MCGUIRE, M.D.When a mechanical impediment to the passage of the contents of the
bowel along the intestinal canal exists, the condition is known as
intestinal obstruction.The causes of this occurrence are numerous, the
symptoms urgent, the diagnosis difficult, the treatment uncertain, and
the termination, unless relieved by nature or art, speedily fatal.There is no class of cases to which the practitioner is called more
important, or which demands on his part greater skill and judgment.It is customary to divide the causes of obstruction of the bowels into
two great classes--acute and chronic.In acute cases the attack is sudden, the symptoms violent, and, unless
the cause is speedily removed, life ends in a few hours or at most in a
few days.In chronic cases the causes act comparatively more slowly,
the symptoms are chronic and less urgent, and danger of death less
imminent.In this class the cause is not uncommonly spontaneously
relieved, and the individual restored to perfect health without the aid
of medicine or the surgeon's art.This result may happen in apparently
the most desperate cases.This classification of acute and chronic obstruction is necessary for a
proper clinical study of the subject, but it should be remembered that
in practice there will be found some cases which partake of many of the
symptoms of both acute and chronic obstruction, making it difficult to
determine to which division the cases properly belong.Sandra went to the bathroom.It will also be
seen that some, at first, well-marked acute cases subside and become
chronic in character, and that (old) chronic cases of obstruction
sometimes suddenly change their nature and become acute.Again, some of
the causes mentioned as giving rise to acute obstruction of the bowel
in rare instances produce symptoms of chronic obstruction, and some of
the causes referred to as giving rise to symptoms of chronic
obstruction in rare instances provoke signs of acute obstruction.As a rule, the following list embraces
conditions which produce symptoms of acute obstruction:

1.Impaction of foreign bodies, gall-stones, enteroliths, etc.Twisting of the bowel--volvulus.Internal strangulation by loops, bands, false membranes,
diverticula, mesenteric pouches, slipping of a portion of bowel into
natural or unnatural openings, diaphragmatic hernia, etc.As a rule, the following causes produce symptoms of chronic intestinal
obstruction:

1.Stricture of the bowel, sometimes cancerous.Contraction of the bowel from inflammatory changes, often
tuberculous.A consideration of external hernia is, of course, not included in this
paper, but the possibility of the symptoms of intestinal obstruction
being due to this cause should never be overlooked.Congenital Strictures and Malformations.Cases of congenital strictures and malformations are confined almost
wholly to the rectum and anus, and come more properly under the
province of the surgeon.Some of the cases, however, belong to the
physician, the obstruction being so slight as not to require surgical
assistance.With all of them, however, the physician should be
familiar, that he may be able to distinguish between congenital
malformation giving rise to immediate obstruction and other forms of
intestinal occlusion.He should know, too, when to seek the aid of the
surgeon.For these reasons, as well as to make the history of the
causes of intestinal obstruction as complete as possible, it has been
thought proper to include in the list congenital occlusion and
malformation of the intestine.They will be treated, however, in the
briefest possible way, and the reader is referred to works on surgery
for a more detailed account of the pathology, symptoms, and treatment.When congenital occlusion of the colon occurs, it is almost invariably
found in the sigmoid flexure, and is due, as most congenital atresia of
the intestine, to foetal peritonitis.Congenital occlusion may be found
in any portion of the small bowel, but a frequent site is the lower
part of the ileum and the ileo-caecal opening.The following case[1]
gives an example of a form of stricture of the duodenum in infants,
with the symptoms and pathological changes.The septum is supposed to
be an unnaturally developed valve, or two valvulae conniventes united:
"A child when born presented no unusual symptoms for the first
twenty-four hours.Vomiting then came on, and continued with short
intermissions until death, which took place some thirty-eight hours
after birth.The only
disease found was stricture of the duodenum close to the entrance of
the gall-duct, so that a probe passed down the latter entered the
duodenum immediately below the constriction.There was nothing to
indicate in what manner the constriction had occurred.On the gastric
side of the latter the duodenum was immensely distended--so much so
that at first sight it appeared like the pyloric end of the stomach
itself, and only by a more careful examination was the distinction
between the stomach and intestine detected by a ridge running around
their place of junction."Pollock in Holmes's _System of Surgery_,
from _Pathological Transactions_, vol.{837} Cases like this, a number of which are on record, are instructive
and of pathological interest; when, however, congenital occlusion
exists in the small intestines, no treatment can be suggested.If the
sigmoid flexure is the part involved and diagnosis can be made, opening
the intestine in the right groin and establishing an artificial anus
should be attempted.In the development of the foetus the anal part of the bowel, beginning
below, develops upward, and the intestinal portion, commencing above,
grows downward; both portions, advancing, finally unite, making one
continuous tube.When, however, there is some interruption in the
foetal development of the intestine, and the two portions of bowel fail
to unite, we have malformation of the rectum and anus and intestinal
obstruction; or the two portions of bowel may have been united and
continuity of the intestinal track established, and subsequent
intra-uterine inflammation may obliterate the canal.Under these
circumstances a ligamentous cord represents the original tube.The cord
descends from the cul-de-sac in which the upper part of the bowel ends
to the skin about the anus, or is lost in the tissues about the neck of
the bladder.In congenital malformations the following conditions may
be found: 1st.The anal orifice may be so minute as not to allow the
feces to escape; or the aperture may be occluded by a membrane, through
which the meconium may be seen; or the anus may be entirely absent.The rectum may be occluded by a membranous septum, the presence of
which is not suspected until symptoms of intestinal obstruction arise,
and then it is discovered by introducing the finger or a probe; or the
rectum may be entirely absent, the colon terminating in the iliac fossa
in a dilated pouch, or ending at the top of the sacrum or stopping at
any point between this and the normal anus, the place being determined
by the period of arrest of foetal development; or, the anus being
absent, the rectum may open into the vagina, bladder, urethra, and
other places.Intestinal obstruction may arise from the introduction, accidental or
otherwise, of foreign bodies into the stomach and bowels.Coins,
marbles, bullets, fruit-seeds, etc.are often swallowed by children,
sometimes intentionally, and if the object is round and small it rarely
gives rise to any serious trouble.The foreign body, however, if small,
may drop into the appendix vermiformis or some other diverticulum and
end in serious mischief, or if the individual has stricture of the
bowel the foreign body may be arrested by it.Foreign bodies which are pointed or irregular in shape, swallowed by
accident or design, may give rise to dangerous and fatal symptoms, but
not unfrequently they escape per vias naturales.Thus, pins, needles,
pieces of bone, artificial plate and teeth, small pen-knives, and other
pointed or irregular-shaped bodies, have passed in this way.Sharp-pointed bodies, as needles, sometimes make their way through the
walls of the stomach and present themselves at other and more distant
parts of the body.I have removed a needle from the calf of the leg
which {838} the patient had a month before accidentally swallowed.Jugglers accidentally, in practising their calling, and insane people,
not unfrequently intentionally, introduce into the stomach all sorts of
foreign bodies, such as buckles, forks, spoons, knives, pieces of wood,
iron, bone, etc.Gross[2] records the case of a juggler who let a bar
of lead ten inches long and weighing a pound slip into his stomach.Bell of Iowa removed it by gastrotomy, and the man recovered.Agnew[3]
reports a post-mortem of an insane woman in whose intestinal canal he
found three spools of cotton, two roller bandages, a number of skeins
of thread, and a pair of suspenders.[Footnote 2: _System of Surgery_, by S. D. Gross, 6th ed., vol.[Footnote 3: _Agnew's Surgery_, vol.The morbid appetite of some people, particularly girls and pregnant
women, sometimes induces them to swallow powdered chalk, magnesia, and
other substances, and when this practice is continued for a long time
the insoluble powder is deposited in the bowel and forms hard masses
which more or less completely obstruct the intestines.Stony concretions or enteroliths are found generally in the caecum or
in the sacculi of the colon, very rarely in the small intestines.They
are round or oval, and when two or more are found together they have
facets.They consist usually of carbonate of lime or magnesia or
sesquioxide of iron.Other concretions are sometimes seen composed of
starch or the felted husks of oats, called oat-stones (avenoliths),
found particularly among the poorer classes of people in Scotland.Other vegetable remains of husks, fibres, etc.Young and middle-aged people more frequently suffer with these
concretions than the old.Foreign bodies made up by the gradual
accumulation of hair, string, and other substances are not unfrequently
found in the stomach and intestines.The mass produced in this way is
often very large.Sometimes the foreign body is arrested in the
oesophagus.In a post-mortem reported to the writer by Fairfax a large
copper coin, accidentally swallowed a few days before, was found lodged
in the gullet.Ulceration followed, a neighboring artery was opened,
and the patient died from hemorrhage.Impaction of the bowel by gall-stones escaping from the gall-bladder
into the bowel is by no means an unfrequent cause of fatal obstruction.Small gall-stones, after giving rise to intense pain and often grave
symptoms during their passage through the bile-ducts, may escape into
the duodenum and be discharged through the rectum, as any other small
foreign body.If, however, there is constriction or stricture of the
bowel at any point, the small gall-stone may lodge there, and if other
stones follow and lodge, the collection may soon be great enough to
produce obstruction.A very large single stone or a number of stones
forming a coherent mass may collect in the gall-bladder, slowly distend
the dilatable biliary passages, and escape into the bowel; or--and this
is more common--an opening made by ulceration between the distended
gall-bladder and the duodenum allows the concretion to escape into the
small intestine.These stones or aggregation of stones are sometimes
three, four, or five inches in circumference and from one to four
inches long.They occur, as a rule, in people over fifty years of age,
and more commonly in women.Brinton, in his excellent book on
_Intestinal Obstruction_, makes the average age in these cases
fifty-three and a half {839} years, and from the statistics he has
gathered it will be seen that their occurrence is four times as often
in females as in males.In 41 cases collected by Leichtenstern, 32 were
women and 9 men.The site of the impaction is always in the small
intestines.In 32 cases observed by Leichtenstern, 17 were found in the
lower part of the ileum, 10 occupied the duodenum and jejunum, and 5
the middle part of the ileum.SYMPTOMS.--Foreign substances introduced into the stomach do not always
immediately give rise to serious symptoms.It is wonderful sometimes to
see how tolerant the stomach is of their presence.Many instances are
recorded of foreign bodies remaining in the stomach for months without
producing dangerous symptoms.The mass may be discharged by vomiting,
or it may escape through the pyloric opening into the intestine, and
ultimately be discharged through the rectum, or, lodging in the bowel,
give rise to symptoms of inflammation and obstruction.If, however, the
foreign mass remains in the stomach, and is not removed by the
surgeon's art or spontaneously discharged by ulceration, as in several
rare instances has been the case, it uniformly proves fatal.Before the foreign body is discharged by ulceration through the walls
of the abdomen, adhesive inflammation unites that portion of the
alimentary canal, gastric or intestinal, in which the mass is lodged
with some part of the abdominal wall.By this union the cavity of the
peritoneum is protected, just as we see the peritoneal sac protected by
an effusion of lymph in hepatic abscess opening into the small
intestine.If the adhesion between the canal and abdominal wall is
imperfect, or by an undue amount of inflammation is disunited, the
foreign body or inflammatory products which surround it may escape into
the peritoneal sac and produce fatal peritonitis.Instead of passing
through the abdominal wall, the foreign substance may escape into the
bladder or vagina, or from the small intestine into the colon or
rectum.Dangerous peritonitis may follow the simple presence of the
foreign body in the alimentary canal from the obstruction it produces
when no attempt at discharge by ulceration has been made.If the size
and shape of the body permit its passage into the small intestine, it
makes its way very slowly along this tube, giving rise to occasional
attacks of colicky pains and symptoms of partial impermeability of the
bowel.At any moment the foreign body may lodge, become impacted in the canal,
and all the grave symptoms of enteritis and general peritonitis present
themselves.Symptoms of inflammation may appear, and after a longer or
shorter time suddenly disappear, as if the foreign body had glided over
some point of obstruction and again begun its descent through the tube.Its course is always irregular, passing quite rapidly over a portion of
the intestine, then going more slowly, then lodging for a time at some
point where it is obstructed by a fold or the contents of the bowel or
by spasmodic contraction of the muscular coat of the intestines.As the
calibre of the small intestine gradually diminishes as it approaches
the caecum, the passage of the foreign body becomes more and more
difficult as it is propelled onward toward the ileo-caecal valve.After
a time it may reach the caecum, where, of all places, it is most apt to
lodge; but it may continue its course to the rectum, where it gives
rise to tenesmus and a constant desire to go to stool.Finally,
spontaneously or aided by the finger of the physician or some
instrument, it is {840} evacuated per anum.Not unfrequently, the
foreign body can be felt through the abdominal walls, and its course
traced day after day as it makes its way along the canal.It is a common practice with uninformed persons to give castor oil or
some purgative medicine when a pin, needle, coin, or other foreign
substance has accidentally passed from the mouth into the stomach.Experience has shown that the
larger and more solid the alvine discharges, the more likely the
foreign body is to escape by the natural outlet; and the physician
should order such a regimen and diet as will probably secure this
condition of the contents of the bowel.Long residence of a foreign mass at any point in the intestinal canal
is certain to produce some chronic enteritis and effusion of lymph and
subsequent stricture of the bowel, or the presence of the foreign body
may produce an ulcer; and when this is healed the resulting cicatrix
may end in serious obstruction from the natural tendency of the new
material to contract.Signs of constriction of the bowel may not be
noticed for some time after the escape of the foreign body.Obstruction from the presence of intestinal stones and concretions is
almost invariably preceded by impaired health, emaciation, or cachectic
appearance, signs of partial impermeability of the bowels, and repeated
attacks of inflammation, especially in the region of the caecum.It
terminates sometimes by the concretion becoming encysted, by its
spontaneous evacuation, or by ulceration and perforation, or sometimes
by complete occlusion of the bowel, and death.As occlusion of the bowel by the presence of gall-stones always occurs
in the small intestines, the symptoms are at once of the most urgent
and violent character.The signs are those of internal strangulation,
and the termination is often rapid in the extreme.Colicky, griping
pains are soon succeeded by violent agony; vomiting begins at once, and
is constant; at first bile is thrown up, and afterward feculent matter;
the pulse is small, wiry, and frequent; the belly is retracted; the
features are pinched, the extremities cold, and prostration soon comes
on, succeeded by collapse.Evidences of disorder of the liver, symptoms of inflammation of the
peritoneum in that region, or attacks of hepatic colic sometimes
precede obstruction of the bowel by gall-stones; unfortunately,
however, for the purposes of diagnosis, these premonitory symptoms are
not invariably present.Acute Internal Strangulation, Twisting, etc.When a portion of bowel within the abdomen is constricted, its
circulation interfered with, and the passage of the contents of the
bowel interrupted, it gives rise to acute internal strangulation.This
condition is very similar to that of external strangulated hernia.The
difference is, that one is inside and the other outside of the cavity
of the abdomen.Twisting of the gut upon its mesenteric axis, the passage of the bowel
through some natural or unnatural opening, the encircling of one
portion of bowel by another or by bands, false membranes, etc., may
cause {841} internal strangulation.It may happen at any age, and
involves generally the small intestine or the more movable parts of the
large bowel--viz.the sigmoid flexure and caecum.Twisting, or torsion, is not an unfrequent cause of intestinal
obstruction, and may involve almost any portion of the intestinal tube.Its most common site is the sigmoid flexure, and next in point of
frequency the caecum.It sometimes, but rarely, involves the small
intestines, and may occur as a simple twisting of one loop of
intestines upon another.First, the mesentery must be elongated.This change in the
mesenteric root may have been caused by the dragging of an old and
large hernia, or the mesentery may have been lengthened by relaxation
of the abdominal walls from childbearing or by the disappearance of
fat.However caused, before torsion of the gut takes place the
mesentery is elongated, so that the two ends are approximated and
something like a pedicle formed.Second, the portion of bowel attached
to the lengthened mesentery may become filled with an enormous quantity
of fecal matter and paralyzed by the great distension.In this paretic
condition it may be displaced by the living, moving parts around it,
and become bent and twisted, or the length of bowel belonging to the
elongated portion of the mesentery may be the seat of inflammation,
and, paralysis following, it becomes without resistance subject to the
pressure and movements of the active vital parts surrounding it.A
portion of bowel with its accumulated contents having a redundant
mesentery and paralyzed by enormous distension or by inflammation, or
by both, may readily be twisted more or less completely, and in some
cases several times upon itself.The weight of the bowel and its contents, along with the rapid
distension of the intestine above, fixes the gut in this state of
torsion and effectually prevents it from untwisting.A semi-rotation of
the paretic and distended bowel about the mesenteric axis is sufficient
to interfere with the supply and return of blood and provoke enteritis.Indeed, the rotation is rarely sufficiently great to produce complete
obstruction, and the symptoms are frequently rather those of
inflammation than of internal strangulation.For weeks before the final
attack the patient usually has symptoms of intestinal disorder, such as
flatulence, constipation, and spells of colic, due no doubt to the
changes provoked by the elongated mesentery and bent or curved
intestine.When torsion takes place the attack is sudden and the
symptoms violent and urgent.Vomiting, meteorism, insuperable
constipation, and frequently tenesmus, are soon followed by collapse
and speedy death.The patient may die in twenty-four hours; he rarely
lives beyond the fourth day.In some cases excessive tenesmus and
bloody stools are seen in the early stages of torsion of the bowel.The
condition may be mistaken for intussusception, but can usually be
distinguished by the premonitory symptoms of twisting and by the more
rapid course, the sudden meteorism, and quick collapse of the latter.Still another way by which displacement of intestine may occasion
obstruction to the passage of its contents is when a portion of the
intestine has a long and narrow mesentery, and around this mesentery,
which is like a pedicle, another portion of the bowel is thrown,
encircling and compressing it.The accompanying figure, taken from
_Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, gives a good idea of this condition (Fig.It represents a {842} loop of the small intestine placed around
the mesenteric pedicle of the sigmoid flexure.Leichtenstern calls this
"intertwining or knotting of two intestinal loops."Anterior view of the strangulated intestine and
stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]Posterior view of the strangulated intestine
and stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]In consequence of inflammation of the peritoneum and effusion of lymph,
peritoneal surfaces are joined together, and before the lymph is fully
organized these surfaces are separated by the constant movements of the
organs and the change in the relationship of the parts, and strings and
bands of various shapes and sizes are formed in which a portion of the
intestine may become entangled and constricted.Sometimes the bowel
accidentally becomes engaged in a loop or noose of false membrane, or
becomes bound down under a band of fibrin; or, the peritoneal surfaces
of some of the organs having been joined together or to the wall of the
abdomen or pelvis, a loop of bowel may escape into a slit or opening
and become incarcerated; or a fold of bowel may fall into a fissure in
the omentum or mesentery or broad ligament of the uterus or suspensory
ligament of the liver, and become constricted; or the appendix
vermiformis may be twisted around the intestine in such a way as to
cause ligation of the tube, or, by becoming attached to some
neighboring part, it may form a loop through which the intestine may
pass and become obstructed.In the same way the bowel may be
constricted by a diverticulum.Bands entangling the bowel and causing strangulation may be
attached to the fimbriated process of the Fallopian tube or the ovary
or uterus.Indeed, it is impossible to describe in a limited space the
almost infinite ways in which these bands and strings may engage and
incarcerate the intestinal tube (Figs.{843} [Illustration: FIG.An appearance of the natural relations of
the diverticulum to the intestine._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal
extremity.]Internal strangulated hernia may result from the bowel falling into a
pouch of the peritoneum and becoming ligated by the orifice of the
pouch, or passing into the foramen of Winslow, of which there are three
cases of strangulation recorded; or a retro-peritoneal hernia may be
formed; or, more common still, a hernia of the intestine through the
diaphragm.In diaphragmatic hernia an opening is more frequently found in the
posterior part of this muscle.Two hundred and fifty-two cases of this
form of internal hernia have been collected by Leichtenstern, in which
the diagnosis was made in only five cases.He found the oesophageal
opening, a spot just behind the sternum, and a gap between the lumbar
and costal parts of the muscle, the weakest points in the diaphragm.Diaphragmatic and other forms of internal hernia may exist and not
produce symptoms of strangulation either at the time of formation or
subsequently, just as we so commonly see in cases of external hernia.When the bowel is constricted, however, and its circulation interfered
with, symptoms of internal strangulation come on, and are exactly like
the symptoms of external strangulated hernia.The attack is sudden, the
symptoms acute and urgent, and the course and termination very rapid.Unless the constriction is relieved death may take place in twenty-four
hours; life is rarely protracted beyond three or four days.The patient has first eructations, soon succeeded by nausea and
vomiting.The matter vomited consists of the contents of the stomach,
then of gastric fluid, bile, and the contents of the intestines.When
the last is ejected the vomiting is called fecal or stercoraceous.The
patient complains of a sense of constriction about the abdomen, griping
pains about the umbilicus, flatulence, tenesmus, and insuperable
constipation.One or two free stools from the large intestine below the
site of strangulation may be passed, but this should not deceive the
practitioner.As a rule, peritonitis soon follows strangulation.The
belly becomes tympanitic and tender, the pulse small and wiry, and the
face anxious.When gangrene supervenes the pain subsides, the pulse
becomes weak and intermittent, the surface cold and clammy, and the
patient soon dies in a state of collapse.Slight delirium may precede
death, or the mind remain unimpaired to the end.Very often, when
gangrene sets in and pain disappears, the patient has a grateful sense
of relief and is hopeful of recovery.{844} Intussusception, Invagination.One of the most frequent and important causes of intestinal obstruction
is intussusception or invagination of the bowel; by which term is meant
the protrusion or slipping of one portion of bowel into a portion
immediately adjoining.This condition is sometimes found after death in persons old or young,
but particularly the latter, in whom during life there were no symptoms
of intestinal obstruction or intestinal trouble of any kind.The
displaced intestine in these subjects is easily reduced, is unattended
by any signs of inflammation, and is evidently the result of spasmodic
contraction of the transverse muscular fibres of the bowel at one part,
with distension and relaxation at another part, by which, just before
death, one piece of the bowel is pushed into an adjacent piece.Not
unfrequently two or more invaginations are seen in the same subject.Flint[4] counted as many as fifteen in a child who died of typhoid
fever.This invagination of the death-struggle almost invariably
involves the small intestine, and may be the protrusion of a piece of
the bowel above into a piece immediately below, or the reverse, a
portion of bowel below being pushed into a portion above.It has been
suggested that this slight and temporary intussusception may occur
during life and give rise to temporary symptoms of intestinal
obstruction, which disappear when reduction of the displacement
spontaneously takes place.[Footnote 4: _Practice of Medicine_.]It will be seen by the diagrams that three successive portions of
intestine enter into the formation of an intussusception--an entering,
returning, and receiving portion.Two mucous surfaces and two serous
surfaces are thus brought into apposition.The mesentery attached to
the included lengths of bowel--viz.the entering and returning
lengths--is necessarily pulled down with the bowel in its descent, and
is also embraced by the receiving portion of the intestinal tube.The
traction excited by this portion of mesentery, thus wedged in between
the middle and inner layers of the bowel, materially alters what would
otherwise be the relationship of the parts.26 shows simple
invagination of the ileum like the finger of a glove, in consequence of
the traction exerted.The entering or invaginated portion does not
always lie in the axis of the enveloping tube, but is more or less
curved, until very often its lower orifice is in contact with the wall
of the outer layer.The concavity of this curve looks {845} toward the
mesenteric edge of the invaginated portion of bowel, and the convexity
toward the opposite side of the receiving portion.The convex side of
the middle cylinder is often thrown into transverse folds or
convolutions.Intussusception, which gives rise to symptoms
characteristic of intestinal obstruction during life, is invariably
from above downward.It is doubtful whether there is on record a single
well-authenticated case of inflammatory invagination where the lower
segment of bowel protruded into the upper.Reference to the diagrams will show that the lumen of the bowel is
diminished, and that more or less intestinal obstruction must follow
invagination.This obstruction is increased by the inflammation which
necessarily follows this condition.The large and numerous
blood-vessels of that portion of the mesentery involved in the
invagination are compressed and stretched; arterial supply, and
especially venous return, are interfered with; congestion quickly
follows, with copious inflammatory exudation; the layers of intestine
become swollen, and blood, sometimes in abundance, is poured out from
the mucous membrane.Peritonitis, limited sometimes to the invaginated
part, more often spreading to the peritoneum covering neighboring
structures, soon begins, and the contiguous serous surfaces are
agglutinated and the intussusception rendered irreducible.Lymph and
other inflammatory products are poured out freely; the coats of the
intestine become distended and thicker, and the inner and middle layers
of the invagination are separated by the deposit; the invaginated part
becomes more and more curved toward the mesenteric border of the outer
layer; and occlusion of the bowel, begun by the invagination, is made
more or less complete by the changes wrought by inflammation (Fig.That intestinal obstruction is not always complete in intussusception
is shown by the fact that fecal matter, often in considerable quantity,
is passed through the bent and narrowed tube, the intestine retaining,
at least for a time, its contractile power.The changes produced by
inflammation are chiefly seen in the inner and middle layers of
intestine, the receiving or outer layer of the invagination often
escaping any serious damage.These changes vary with the character and
duration of the inflammation.Sometimes they are limited to an
agglutination of the opposed serous membranes, an effusion of blood and
serum from the mucous surfaces, and an enormous distension and swelling
of all the invaginated parts; or the inflammation may end in
mortification of the middle or both the inner and middle cylinders, the
dead part coming away in shreds or in large fragments, or, if the
patient lives long enough, the entire invaginated tube being discharged
through the anus.If the inflammation involves the invaginated parts
unequally, strips and shreds of the bowel are detached by ulceration
and sloughing, and may escape in the discharge from the bowels in
pieces so small as to be unnoticed; but if the intussuscepted part dies
en masse, a circular line of demarcation is formed by ulceration, and
the dead segment is detached and drops into the cavity of the bowel
below, and escapes through the rectum.It is often so complete that the
inner and middle cylinders can be recognized, and the part of the
intestinal tube to which the expelled bowel belonged can be determined.In favorable cases the blood-vessels of the healthy bowel above and
below the dead segment pour out a circular mass of coagulable lymph,
which, becoming organized, closes the breach and {846} completes the
intestinal tube.To accomplish this it is necessary that the ends of
the two portions of bowel should be accurately coaptated: if they are
not, some opening may be left through which the contents of the gut may
escape into the peritoneal cavity, producing fatal peritonitis; or the
new formation may be imperfectly organized, and burst during some
peristaltic movement of the bowel or from the pressure of gas
accumulating in the gut; or the supply of lymph may be so redundant as
to obstruct the calibre of the bowel, or end in cicatricial
contraction, stricture, and obstruction.Aitken[5] records four
instances where the curved end of the invaginated portion of bowel by
prolonged pressure caused ulceration and perforation of the coats of
the enclosing bowel, the invaginated portion passing through the side
of the enclosing segment and projecting into the cavity of the
peritoneum.[Footnote 5: _Science and Practice of Medicine_.]Gangrene and ulceration, however, do not always follow intussusception.The mesenteric injuries may be sufficient to produce congestion and
exudation, and the patient survive the invagination for weeks, and
death eventually occur without sloughing or ulceration; or spontaneous
reduction of the invagination may take place and recovery of the
patient follow.The last termination must be rare, and impossible when
firm adhesion between the serous surfaces has taken place; but that it
does exceptionally occur is proved by cases where the diagnosis of
intussusception was undoubted, the invagination being felt in the
rectum or seen prolapsed through the anus.The most common termination,
if the patient survives, is mortification of the invaginated part and
separation in mass or by shreds or fragments.Intussusception may occur in any portion of the intestinal canal, but
some points are more liable to it than others.of the
cases collected by Brinton were ileo-caecal; in 32 per cent.the small
intestine alone was involved; 28 iliac and 4 jejunal; in 12 per cent.the colon, including its sigmoid flexure, was the part implicated.When the rectum is involved, it usually forms the outer layer of the
invagination, the middle and inner layers being formed by the bowel
which has passed from above into it; when prolapse of the rectum itself
occurs, the mucous membrane is generally alone involved, but along with
this the muscular coat may also descend and a true invagination of the
rectum be found.The most common variety of intussusception is the ileo-caecal.It is in
this form that we find the greatest length of bowel involved.This
invagination begins generally at the ileo-caecal valve, the lips of
which at first turn toward, and descend into, the cavity of the caecum,
drawing with them the end of the ileum; in this case the valve forms
the lowest point of the invagination.If the invagination continues,
the end of the caecum is next inverted; and if the process still goes
on, more and more of the colon is invaginated, until in some rare cases
it traverses the whole of the large intestine, appearing just above or
even protruding through the anus.In this variety the vermiform
appendix lies between the middle and inner layers of the
intussusception, and its opening, usually stretched and enlarged by the
inverted caecum and inflammatory effusion, is found close to the
ileo-caecal orifice.In this intussusception the caecum and colon are
large and roomy, and the invaginated portion not so liable, {847} as it
is when the small intestine is alone implicated, to strangulation and
sloughing; nor is there seen in ileo-caecal intussusception, unless the
portion of bowel involved is very short, the marked curvature of the
invaginated portion so commonly found in the small intestine.In the
ileo-caecal form it is twisted or much convoluted rather than bent.Another variety of ileo-caecal invagination--very rare, however--is
where the ileo-caecal orifice does not descend into the cavity of the
caecum, but the lower end of the ileum passes through the valve into
the large intestine.In this instance the invaginated portion is
tightly compressed by the valve, and strangulation is speedy and
complete.An invagination may occur in the lower part of the ileum, and
the inner and middle layers pass on to the ileo-caecal valve, and be
arrested at that point, and afterward, in consequence of violent
peristaltic action, the whole intussusception, inner, middle, and outer
layers, be invaginated into the colon.In this way the invagination
becomes doubled.While intussusception may occur in either sex and at all periods of
life, it happens nearly twice as often in males as in females, and is
most frequently seen in childhood.Leichtenstern[6] found in his
statistics of 473 cases that one-half were seen in children under ten
years old, and one-fourth of all intussusceptions occurred in children
from four to twelve months old.Invagination of the small intestine is
found almost exclusively in adults.Brinton from his records gives the
mean age of its occurrence 34.6 years.According to the same author,
the average age of ileo-caecal invaginations is 18.57 years, and
one-half of all cases of this form of intussusception observed by him
were in children under seven years of age.Leichtenstern states that
the lower part of the ileum is the most frequent site of invagination
in the small intestine, and the descending colon and sigmoid flexure
the most common portion involved in intussusception occurring in the
large intestine.cit._]

The mechanism of intussusception is probably not always the same.The
following is thought to be the most frequent process: A segment of
bowel becomes paralyzed by local peritonitis, some injury, diarrhoea,
or colic, and while in this state a segment of bowel above is subjected
to violent peristaltic action, and is forced into the unresisting
portion below.In this case the paretic segment forms the outer or
receiving layer of the intussusception.Leichtenstern believes that the
paretic portion is turned in and invaginated into the normal bowel
below, and that the clinical course of intussusception and post-mortem
appearance correspond with this explanation.If such is the case, the
paralyzed portion forms the inner layer, and the active bowel below the
receiving layer.Another theory, which applies with much force to the
most common of all invaginations--viz.the ileo-caecal--is, that as
violent anal tenesmus produces prolapse of the rectum, so prolonged and
powerful tenesmus at the ileo-caecal opening may cause prolapse of the
lips of this orifice, and, eventually, invagination of the ileum, or of
both this and the caecum, into the colon.When we remember that the
ileo-caecal valve is furnished with a sphincter muscle, the analogy is
complete.The idea so long entertained that intestinal worms may
occasion invagination of the bowel has generally been abandoned.A
polypoid tumor, by dragging down the portion of bowel to which it is
attached, may produce invagination; and {848} Brinton's statistics give
5 per cent.of cases of intussusception from this source.An
examination of a larger number of cases would probably show a much
smaller percentage due to this cause.A majority of cases of intussusception, however, take place suddenly,
without previous diarrhoea, colic, traumatism, or ill-health of any
kind, and probably occur without any tenesmus or paresis of a portion
of bowel.It may be that the longitudinal fibres of a segment of gut
contract, dilating and shortening a portion of the bowel; while this
part is distended a portion immediately above may be lengthened and
narrowed by contraction of the circular fibres, and violent peristalsis
going on at this moment, aided, possibly, by contraction of the
muscular wall of the abdomen, forces the upper and narrow segment into
the lower and dilated one.At first the invagination involves a small portion of the bowel, but,
active peristaltic action continuing, it rapidly increases in size.This increase is made at the expense of the sheath or outer layer,
which turns in to form the middle layer.The length of the invagination
varies from two or three inches to three, four, or five feet.The symptoms of intussusception generally come on suddenly, and
indicate both intestinal obstruction and inflammation.Pain resembling
violent colic, and referred to the site of the invagination, is a
prominent symptom.The pain is intense, paroxysmal in character, but
after a time it becomes continuous.At first pressure gives relief, but
in a few hours tenderness, denoting peritonitis, appears, limited to
the invagination or spreading gradually over the whole abdomen.Vomiting soon follows, and, with rare exceptions, is persistent.After
two or three days occasionally blood and sometimes fecal matter are
ejected from the stomach.Diarrhoea, with bloody, mucoid stools, is
rarely ever absent, and is characteristic of invagination.The patient
has from fifteen to twenty passages a day.If the large intestine is
involved, the diarrhoea is accompanied with tenesmus.Above the
obstruction gas and ingesta accumulate, and produce abdominal
distension, sometimes well marked.Generally the tumor formed by the
invagination can be felt through the abdominal wall, and is a symptom
of great importance.Meteorism and peritonitis may render the existence
of the tumor obscure or altogether prevent its recognition, but in
intussusception of the colon and at the ileo-caecal valve the solid
cylindrical mass can usually be found, and frequently, when the small
bowel alone is implicated, a very careful and patient examination will
enable the observer to detect it.Sometimes it changes its site, size,
and shape; occasionally it can be felt in the rectum or is seen
protruding through the anus.The urgency of the symptoms of invagination depends upon the portion of
bowel involved and the degree of constriction of the gut and its
attached mesentery.When the bowel is tightly constricted the symptoms
are acute, and the patient may die in a day or two; when the bowel is
not constricted the symptoms are chronic in character, and in the early
stages not urgent.The difference here is like that between
strangulated and incarcerated hernia.In acute cases the attack is sudden, obstruction complete, and the
symptoms those of internal strangulation of the bowel, often followed
by collapse, which may destroy life in a few hours.These cases are
{849} chiefly jejunal and iliac invaginations, and the higher up in the
small intestine the seat of obstruction the more violent and urgent the
symptoms.Constriction, being great, is followed by engorgement and
inflammation of the invaginated bowel, and if the patient lives long
enough gangrene ensues, by which the obstructing mass is separated and
discharged en masse or in fragments through the anus.Not unfrequently
life is saved in this way.That gangrene has taken place and separation
of the invaginated segments is in progress are often known by the very
fetid character of the evacuations and by their admixture with blood
and shreds of necrosed bowel.When the sequestrum has been detached
entire, it is often passed with difficulty.Frequently it lodges at
some point in the bowel, producing temporary obstruction and giving
rise to tenesmus and pain as it passes along the large intestine.There
is no doubt that the continuity of the intestine above and below the
neck of the invagination has been established, and complete cures
effected in the way already mentioned.Usually, however, the patient
dies from collapse, peritonitis, or perforation of the bowel before the
obstructing mass can be removed by gangrene.Children almost invariably
die before this can take place, and adults live from the seventh to the
fourteenth day, according to the greater or less violence and acuteness
of the symptoms.When the slough has been discharged and the continuity
of intestine established, recovery is still uncertain, and death very
often happens for reasons referred to in speaking of the separation of
the sequestrum.Separation of the invaginated portion and its expulsion, according to
Leichtenstern, in the majority of cases takes place from the eleventh
to the twenty-first day, but in chronic cases it is often delayed for
months.According to Brinton, separation of the sequestrum occurs
between the eighth and fifteenth in intussuscepted small intestine, and
between the fifteenth and twenty-second days in acute cases of
ileo-caecal and colic invaginations.In chronic cases of intussusception, which usually embrace the
ileo-caecal and colic varieties, strangulation is not common and the
course of the disease is protracted.These cases often last for several
months, and the symptoms are not always well defined.At first the pain
is paroxysmal, with long intervals of ease.Vomiting succeeds, but is
not persistent; discharge of the contents of the bowel below the seat
of lesion takes place and afterward fecal matter from above this point,
because the permeability of the bowel is not usually lost in chronic
cases.Eventually the alvine discharges become bloody, mucoid, and
characteristic of intussusception; the severity of the symptoms may
gradually increase, the pain becoming greater, more constant, the
vomiting more incessant, the discharges from the bowels more frequent,
and in one, two, or three months the patient dies from asthenia.Several authentic cases are related where the disease lasted one or two
years before terminating fatally.Very often some days before death the
pain and tenderness cease, and the operations become free from blood
and normal in character.Constipation is a prominent symptom in all of the conditions which give
rise to intestinal obstruction, and habitual constipation or loss of
the powers provided for the advance of the contents of the intestines
not unfrequently leads to permanent occlusion of the canal.It is
impossible to fix any definite rule as a standard of health for the
number and quantity of alvine evacuations.Some individuals have a
passage from the bowels once every day; others, in the enjoyment of as
good general health, suffer from the ordinary inconveniences of
constipation if they have less than two or three daily fecal
discharges; others, again, apparently equally as well, have a movement
from their bowels once in two or three days or once a week, or even
once in two weeks.Habershon[7] records the case of a "woman sixty
years old who from youth upward had had a passage from the bowels only
every six or eight days, and whose health had been perfect."A lady
under my own observation, for twenty years never had an alvine
discharge oftener than once in two weeks, and three times in her life
had passed two months without a movement of her bowels.This lady was
the mother of several children, and, although not in perfect health,
was able to attend to her ordinary household duties.Such cases are not
very uncommon, and occur, as far as I have been able to ascertain, more
frequently in women than in men.[Footnote 7: _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, quoted by Leichtenstern in
_Ziemssen's Cyc.The number of fecal evacuations and the quantity discharged have been
shown by Bischoff and Voit to depend, to some extent, upon the
character of the food ingested, vegetable diet producing abundant, and
animal diet scanty, stools.Doubtless, the quality of the food partly
explains the quantity of the alvine evacuation, although, to some
extent, this must depend upon the time that the feces remain in the
colon, a long residence there taking away a greater part of the watery
constituents and making the fecal mass thicker and harder; but the
variations in the number of stools in persons living on the same diet
can only be explained by the variations in the activity of the
peristaltic action in different individuals, or in the same individual
at different periods and under different surroundings.The causes of habitual constipation are of the most varied and
diversified character, and it is not always possible in an individual
case to point out the original or primary one.Not unfrequently several
causes are in operation at the same time to produce sluggishness of the
intestinal canal and constipation.Very often it begins with change of
scene and habits, by which the daily visit to the water-closet is
interfered with, or after confinement to bed with some temporary
indisposition.It is more likely to occur in men and women whose habits
are sedentary and who are constitutionally lazy and indolent.The feces
are allowed to remain in the rectum and colon, and every hour after the
ordinary time for going to stool diminishes the watery parts of the
fecal mass and makes it harder and more consistent.Many cases of
chronic constipation, begun in this way, have ended in dilatation and
thickening of the intestine, ulceration of the mucous membrane, and,
eventually, perforation of the coats and escape of the contents of the
gut into the peritoneal cavity.Rapid {851} excretion of water by the
kidneys, lungs, and skin produces constipation by withdrawing a large
proportion of the water from the fecal mass, rendering it unnaturally
dry and of diminished bulk.In diabetes, constipation arises from this
cause unless the patient makes up the loss by drinking an unusually
large quantity of water.Constipation in nursing-women is explained by
the loss of water in the secretion of milk.The profuse sweating which
attends malarial fever, phthisis, and other diseases readily accounts
for the constipation which often accompanies these disorders.Certain articles of food not necessary to mention here produce
constipation.They fail to excite peristaltic action; or articles of
diet which at first act as a stimulus to the bowels, and even provoke
temporary diarrhoea, lose their power if kept up too long--just as
certain purgative medicines lose their force if continued for too long
a period.Gradually they cease to increase the peristaltic action, and
rather add than otherwise to the inactivity of the intestines.Eating
the same kind of food day after day is very apt, sooner or later, to
result in diminished sensibility of the intestinal canal, a reduction
of the peristaltic force, and deficiency in the secretion of the
digestive juices, which in itself is a common cause of constipation.Frequent change of diet is generally needed to supply the stimulus
necessary for that intestinal motion which relieves the bowels.Bile is looked upon as one of the most powerful agents in stimulating
peristaltic action, and when, from any cause, mechanical or otherwise,
it is not poured into the bowel, constipation ensues.Unnatural
flexures, congenital or acquired, of the large intestine are not
unfrequently the source of chronic constipation.These flexures, normal
or factitious, favor accumulation of feces, especially in subjects who
have diminished sensibility of the bowel and a paretic state of the
muscular coat.Certain injuries and diseases of the brain and spinal
cord reduce, and sometimes altogether prevent, intestinal activity.Hysteria, if it exist for any length of time, is generally attended by
sluggishness of the bowels, and great mental depression (melancholia)
is sometimes preceded and sometimes followed by habitual constipation.In treating such a case it is important to make the distinction.Temporary paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel, followed by
symptoms of intestinal constriction, with insuperable constipation,
sometimes attends violent contusion of the abdomen.In some cases
prolonged functional weakness of the muscular coat follows the injury.Many chronic diseases leave the bowel in a sluggish condition by the
pathological changes produced in the intestine.The function of the
muscular coat is frequently injured by the infiltration which
accompanies peritonitis.The fibres are separated by the serous
effusion which attends this inflammation; they become overstretched,
and, losing their contractility, end in paralysis and obstinate
constipation.Occlusion of the canal from this cause may last for days,
and be accompanied with tympanitis, stercoraceous vomiting, and all the
signs of internal strangulation, ending in death.Post-mortem
examinations in such cases show no stricture or unnatural diminution in
the size of the canal, but that the fatal occlusion was due to
paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel and arrest of its power.The normal advance of the contents of the bowel is interfered with by
any cause which lessens the contractility of the muscular coat.Chronic
{852} diseases which debilitate the general muscular system affect at
the same time the contractile power of the muscular coat of the canal,
and the debility and degeneration of old age are felt here, and
sometimes occasion the constipation which often accompanies this period
of life.Leichtenstern[8] says that chronic intestinal catarrh is a
common factor of constipation--that when this catarrh is of long
standing it produces relaxation of the muscular coat and diminishes the
elasticity of the intestinal walls.He believes that this pathological
condition exists in a large proportion of the cases of habitual
constipation attended with mental depression, that the hypochondriasis
makes its appearance after the constipation has become chronic, and
that it is a secondary symptom.This affection is located chiefly in
the small intestine, and does not usually involve the colon.cit._]

Probably the most common form of chronic constipation is that which
accompanies loss of sensibility and muscular inactivity of the colon
and rectum.The large bowel becomes sometimes so distended by the
accumulated fecal masses that it has been found after death to measure
ten or fifteen inches in circumference and to contain an astonishing
quantity of feces.Any part of the canal, except the last two inches of
the rectum, which is kept empty by the contraction of the sphincters,
may be occupied by the mass, but the accumulation is greatest in the
rectum, caecum, and sigmoid flexure.At the last-named location the
distension is so great that the mass can be readily felt through the
abdominal walls.The tumor may be as large as a foetal head, and may be
mistaken for a simple or malignant tumor of the omentum, stomach, or
other organ, or for pregnancy or ovarian growth.The dilatation may be
so enormous as to push the small intestines into the back part of the
abdominal cavity and to interfere with the function of any organ upon
which it encroaches.It may press upon the concave surface of the
liver, and, arresting the flow of bile, produce jaundice or
mechanically interfere with some portion of the track of the urinary
organs and <DW36> their functions.When situated in a portion of the
canal not tightly attached to the abdominal walls it is slightly
movable, more or less hard and consistent, according to its duration,
for it remains often for months unchanged, sometimes giving to the
fingers the impression of a rather soft, easily-indented swelling with
a uniform smooth surface--more often feeling like a hard, irregular,
elongated, and corrugated mass of fecal balls.Contraction here and
there of bundles of the circular muscular fibres of the gut produces
the irregular, corrugated impression imparted to the fingers.Their
shape and position may sometimes be changed by pressure through the
abdominal wall.If the accumulation occurs in the rectum, the
introduction of a tube or bougie is prevented by the impacted mass,
which can be gotten away only by the fingers or by some instrument.The
colon and rectum may be dilated to their utmost capacity with an
enormous amount of feces, enough to fill a common-sized pail, and both
the patient and medical attendant be deceived as to the sufferer's
condition by the fact that he has his daily number of stools.The
semi-fluid contents of the small intestines find their way through this
mass by some irregular and uncertain track, undermining and breaking
down sometimes a lump of the old fecal accumulation, which, if small in
size or broken up, may pass on and {853} escape by the anus, but if
large and hard may drop into the irregular and uncertain passage and
permanently close it; then sudden and complete intestinal occlusion
takes place, with all of its fearful consequences.If this, however,
should not occur, and the accumulation is not recognized and removed,
the enormous dilatation may go on until complete paralysis of the
muscular coat is produced, and entire stoppage of the current of feces,
with permanent occlusion of the bowel; or before this takes place
ulceration may set in, partly because of the great pressure of the
fecal mass upon the mucous membrane, and partly from the irritating
character of the contents of the bowel.Ulceration begins, most likely,
at some point where resistance is greatest, and perforation of the
bowel may ensue.SYMPTOMS.--If the accumulation occupies only a portion of the colon, as
the caecum or sigmoid flexure, the distended part may become displaced
and twisted on its long axis.This condition scarcely ever happens in
the large intestines except at the parts mentioned.Torsion of the
caecum rarely takes place except in persons of from forty-five to sixty
years of age, while twisting of the sigmoid flexure may happen at any
period of life.When distended and very heavy from the weight of feces,
with probably some congenital defect about its mesenteric attachment,
the sigmoid flexure may become twisted and drop into the pelvis,
producing at once symptoms of internal strangulation.Individuals accustomed to having one or more alvine evacuations a day
are made uncomfortable by two or three days of constipation.A feeling
of distension about the abdomen, with flatulence and heat, follows this
condition, and soon afterward headache, loss of appetite, and symptoms
of indigestion supervene.If this state of the bowels continues
unrelieved, pressure upon the hemorrhoidal veins takes place and
interference with venous return, producing congestion in the lower end
of the rectum.This is attended by straining, diarrhoea, evolution of
gaseous matter, colicky pains, and possibly sympathetic disturbance of
the genito-urinary organs.When at last the hardened and enlarged mass
is discharged, it produces some pain and burning about the anus, with
possibly rupture of the mucous membrane in that region.Fissure of the
anus may thus originate.In the case of a lad aged about nine years
under my care fissure of the anus began in this way, and after its
formation the pain of defecation was so intense that he resisted for
ten days every attempt of his bowels to move.After this time he passed
every day or two one or more hardened fecal balls, but always with such
atrocious pain that he looked forward to the next attempt with terror.This case ended in fecal impaction, which nearly proved fatal.Not unfrequently persons who habitually go two or three days without
having a passage from the bowels are not apparently inconvenienced, and
after a time any of the discomforts ordinarily felt from constipation
are not noticed, if indeed any exist.Generally, however, chronic constipation leads to a host of troubles of
the most varied character.There is not an organ in the body that is
not more or less influenced by it.The generation of gas in the
intestines produces a sense of fulness of the abdomen and elevation of
the diaphragm which interferes with the action of the lungs and heart.The sufferer is oppressed, sighs, and has difficult respiration and
attacks of {854} palpitation of the heart.The influence of the
abdominal pressure is conducted by the sympathetic nerves to the brain,
and the patient frequently has vertigo, headache, ringing in the ears,
faintness, etc., and in consequence of the pressure upon other nerves
or of hyperaemia of the spinal cord and its membranes he has dull
aching pains in his back, groins, genitals, or extremities.I have seen
in several instances pain in the legs, coming on after the patient has
retired and lasting until morning, violent enough to prevent sleep, at
once permanently relieved by an active cathartic after antiperiodics,
alteratives, and anodynes had failed to do any good.A patient suffering from habitual constipation usually obtains
temporary relief by the bowels acting either spontaneously or after a
dose of medicine; but, the causes of constipation continuing, the
physical discomforts and suffering continue, varied in every
conceivable way.His digestion being disturbed, appetite poor, and
assimilation imperfect, he gradually loses flesh and his complexion
becomes sallow and unhealthy.In addition to this, he soon grows
irritable and fretful, trifling affairs trouble him, he has fits of
great mental depression, and soon settles down into hypochondriasis,
his life becoming a burden to himself and a nuisance to his friends.If the constipation ends in fecal accumulation, the worst symptoms of
mechanical obstruction may present themselves at any time, and death of
the individual follow.The practitioner should always keep this fact in
mind in treating every case of intestinal obstruction, and search for
fecal impaction by examining the rectum and the whole length of the
large intestine through the anterior abdominal wall.Very often
symptoms of impaction come on gradually in one who has been ailing for
some weeks or months, but sometimes the onset is as sudden as in a case
of acute occlusion of the intestines.The patient is seized with pain
like that of colic and an urgent desire to empty his bowels, but all
attempts to do this are futile, and the straining is followed by great
exhaustion; borborygmus, nausea, vomiting, and possibly hiccough, soon
come on, with tympanitic distension of the belly.If the impaction is
not overcome, death by collapse or from peritonitis follows.Post-mortem examination shows enormous fecal accumulation, peritonitis
as a consequence of the obstruction, perforating ulcer in some part of
the large bowel, more often the sigmoid flexure, or, in some cases,
absolute rupture of the caecum itself, and escape of its contents into
the peritoneal cavity.In a report by George Pollock[9] of 127 cases of intestinal
obstruction, 77 belonged to the above class; and Brinton, in his
analysis of the whole group of cases collected by him, says stricture
constitutes about 73 per cent.In 124 cases of intestinal obstruction
reported by Mr.Bryant[10] from the post-mortem records of Guy's
Hospital, 47 were found to be stricture of the bowel.The above
statements show that stricture, or diminution of the calibre of the
bowel, is the most frequent cause of {855} intestinal obstruction, and
the subject is worthy of our earnest consideration.[Footnote 9: _Medico-Chirurgical Review_, 1853.][Footnote 10: _Practice of Surgery_.]While stricture of the bowel may be found in any portion of the
intestinal canal, it occurs most frequently in the sigmoid flexure and
rectum.Brinton found in 100 fatal cases of stricture 30 in the rectum
and 30 in the sigmoid flexure; only 8 cases in 100 were in the small
intestine.Brinton's statistics correspond very nearly with those of
other writers.The affection is more common in men than women, and the
average age at death is about forty-four years.The most common cause of stricture is contraction following
cicatrization of ulcers of the mucous and submucous coats of the
intestine.The ulcer may involve the circumference of the bowel, and
the resulting cicatrix terminate in uniform constriction of its lumen,
or the ulceration may extend several inches along the side of the
intestine, ultimately causing contraction in the direction of its
longitudinal axis, marked stenosis, and kinking of the gut.When
ulceration, continuous or in patches, involves a large extent of bowel,
it may reduce the gut to a mass of indistinguishable cicatricial
tissue.Bristowe[11] says he has seen the whole caecum thus contracted
"into a channel barely capable of admitting a goose's quill."[Footnote 11: Reynolds's _System of Medicine_.]Stricture of the intestine often follows dysentery or tubercular and
syphilitic ulceration of the bowel.Follicular or hemorrhoidal
ulceration is sometimes the beginning of a stenosis which ends in
stricture of the rectum.Stercoral ulcers of the colon are not
unfrequently the starting-point of cicatricial contraction of the
calibre of the bowel.Sometimes, but rarely, ulcers of typhoid fever
end in constriction of the intestinal tube.The diameter of the gut is
also contracted by the effects of caustic substances, by ulceration
following the lodgment of foreign bodies, and by effusion of lymph or
thickening attendant upon long-standing hernia.Very often after death
it is impossible to determine what particular kind of inflammation and
ulceration caused the stricture.Generally, the cause which provokes
the ulceration sets up chronic peritonitis, which materially aids in
producing the obstruction.Spasm of the circular muscular fibres
usually accompanies these lesions, and materially contributes in many
cases to fatal intestinal obstruction.Some authors assert that spasm
without organic change can produce acute obstruction: such an
occurrence, except possibly in the rectum, must be very rare, if indeed
it ever happens.The most common cause of stricture is cancer.This disease may
originate in the bowel itself, or, beginning in some neighboring organ
or tissue, gradually spreads and involves the gut.It may extend around
the bowel or be infiltrated along the sides of the canal for several
inches, and may be scirrhous, medullary, or epithelial in character.of the cases of cancer of the bowel are situated in
the rectum.Usually, but not invariably, cancerous deposits are found
in persons who have passed middle age.An impediment to the passage of fecal matter is invariably produced in
constriction of the intestine from the above causes, and it frequently
continues until fatal occlusion occurs.The contents of the bowel
accumulate above the block, producing distension of the gut and
thickening of the muscular coats above the stricture, with contraction
and atrophy {856} of the portion of intestine below.Dilatation of the
bowel above the seat of lesion is sometimes great enough to cause
rupture and peritoneal extravasation, or distension and stretching of
the coats of the canal may be sufficient to interfere with its
circulation, and ulceration ensue.Occasionally cases of stricture or well-marked circumscribed
contraction of the bowel are seen which give rise to no marked symptoms
of constriction during life.Such was the case in the instance related
by Bristowe and referred to above.These instances are, however,
exceptional in the large intestine.Symptoms of stricture vary according to the site, cause, and extent of
the lesion.They are gradually developed, and in this respect are
unlike the symptoms of internal strangulation or of intussusception,
which are generally acute and rapid in their course.When the
obstruction in stricture is complete, progress toward death is
comparatively slow.If the stricture is seated in the small intestine,
the symptoms are often so obscure that for a long time the presence of
the contraction may not be suspected; the contents of the small bowel
are usually fluid, and in this state readily pass through the
constricted part.The more solid the contents of the bowel, the greater
the difficulty in passing a contracted and narrow orifice, and the more
conclusive and characteristic the assemblage of symptoms of obstruction
from stricture.The history of a case of intestinal obstruction from stricture is often
instructive.For weeks or months there have been colicky pains and
intestinal disorder; possibly, in the early stages, diarrhoea, but
later marked constipation, and probably previous attacks where
constipation was for a time insuperable and death from obstruction
imminent.Hemorrhage, except in cancer or when complicated with piles,
is rare.The attack may come on suddenly, or constipation become more
and more difficult to overcome; violent peristalsis presents itself,
accompanied by pain and abdominal distension, and followed by nausea
and vomiting, the latter often being stercoraceous.During the throes
of pain--for it is paroxysmal--the outline of the distended gut can be
felt and seen through the abdominal walls if they are thin and free
from fat.Unless the stricture is relieved the patient gradually dies
from asthenia.Inflammation is often absent throughout, but enteritis
or peritonitis may come on, or perforation and peritoneal extravasation
ensue and hasten the fatal termination.When the obstruction is in the rectum it can be felt with the finger;
if in the sigmoid flexure, it may be felt with a gum bougie or probe,
but the use of the former is unreliable, and the latter, unless
carefully employed, dangerous.Obstruction at this point, however, is
attended with marked distension of the descending and transverse colon.If seated in the small bowel, the large intestine is flaccid and
collapsed.Careful manual exploration often enables the practitioner to
determine the site of the contraction.Weight, pain, dulness, and
fulness are usually found about the stricture, but these signs may be
of little value when the abdominal wall is thick and unyielding, or
peritonitis or tumor is present, or the contracted portion of bowel is
compressed or drawn out of its proper site.Brinton suggests that the
site of stricture may be determined by the quantity of water which can
be injected through the anus into the bowel.Such an estimation must
often be erroneous, as stricture {857} is rarely ever complete and
fluid may be forced through the constricted part.Indeed, Battey of
Georgia has demonstrated upon dead and living subjects that fluid may
be made to pass through the entire canal from the anus to the stomach.Obstruction due to cancer of the rectum can be determined by digital
examination.When seated in the small intestine or higher up in the
large bowel, the presence of a painful tumor, preceded for weeks by
evidences of impaired nutrition, emaciation, and followed by
lancinating pain, cancerous cachexia, etc., will indicate the character
of the trouble.Compression and Contraction of the Bowel.Obstruction of the bowel is sometimes occasioned by compression or
traction exerted on the intestine by abdominal tumors or cysts.Fibrous
tumors of the uterus, ovarian cysts, hydatid growths, or indeed any
form of abdominal tumor, may by pressure on some part of the intestinal
track produce fatal obstruction.Several inches of bowel may thus be
compressed and rendered impervious, or if traction is exerted by the
tumor, which is often adherent to the bowel, the tube may be sharply
bent or twisted and its action interfered with.A case is reported of
compression of the bowel from a great accumulation of fat about the
colon.Adhesions of intestinal coils from chronic peritoneal
inflammatory changes constitute a large and important class of cases of
intestinal obstruction.This condition is known as contraction of the
bowels: 23 of the 124 cases reported by Bryant were of this character.The usual site of stricture is the large bowel: contraction is far more
frequently seen in the small intestine, and is caused by an effusion of
lymph following simple peritonitis or the inflammation attending the
formation of cancer or tubercle of the peritoneum.Coils of intestine
are matted together or to neighboring parts in this way by bands of
lymph or false membranes, and the action of the bowel interfered with
or obstructed.Constriction of a length of bowel may be found after
death, or a sharp, angular bend by which complete obstruction has been
produced.Circumscribed peritonitis may produce adhesion of a portion of bowel by
bands of lymph to the uterus or its appendages, or to some part of the
large intestine, or to the abdominal wall, and the action of the bowel
become embarrassed by traction, constriction, or bending.In
consequence of the irritation following this condition, spasmodic
contraction may follow and add to the difficulty, or enteritis may
ensue; and this will especially be the case if the circulation of the
part is interfered with, and render complete what before was a partial
obstruction.Distension and fulness of the bowel above the obstruction,
with contraction and emptiness of the portion of the gut below, are
found after death in cases of contraction, just as we see in fatal
cases of stricture.The history of the case and presence of a tumor
will generally enable the practitioner to determine when obstruction is
due to the presence of some adventitious growth.When contraction is
complicated with the presence of tubercle or cancer, symptoms attending
these conditions will be present.Obstruction of the intestines from contraction generally comes on {858}
insidiously.The patient may date the beginning of his trouble from an
old attack of circumscribed peritonitis which probably took place weeks
or months before.He has attacks of colicky pains, indigestion, and
constipation.The last is difficult to overcome, continuing for hours
before it is relieved by medicine or the efforts of nature.During the
attack of almost insurmountable constipation violent peristaltic
movement of the bowel above the impediment may be noticed.The patient
may gradually become more and more feeble from suffering and
interference with nutrition, and die from exhaustion, or fits of
obstinate constipation may continue to recur, until finally one of them
becomes insuperable and fatal.The symptoms of contraction closely resemble those of stricture, but it
is important to distinguish one from the other, as the treatment,
especially if surgical interference is demanded, is very different.A
rigid analysis of all of the signs will usually, but not invariably,
enable the practitioner to make the distinction.There is an important difference between the constipation of stricture
and that of contraction.In the former the difficulty is in defecation,
emptying the large bowel, the usual site of stricture; in the latter
the difficulty is in the passage of the contents of the gut along the
narrowed and contracted small intestine, the common site of
contraction.In stricture the calibre of the bowel is diminished by
some sharply-defined mechanical impediment seated in the cavity or in
the walls of the tube; in contraction the bowel is bent or kinked by
adhesions, or coils of intestine are matted and glued together and
peristalsis interfered with.In stricture defecation is difficult and
painful; in contraction the alvine discharges are painless.In the
former blood and mucus are not unfrequently seen in the feces; in the
latter the motions are healthy.In stricture constipation alternates
with diarrhoea; in contraction looseness of the bowels is rarely seen.In stricture distension of the abdomen is lumbar and epigastric; in
contraction the distension is less and is central and hypogastric.In
both conditions violent distinct peristaltic action is seen during a
fit of constipation, and in both the bowel above the constriction is
distended and hypertrophied.In contraction the powerful, writhing
peristalsis involves the small intestine above the impediment, and in
stricture the large bowel above the obstruction.In both stricture and
contraction inflammation of the bowel and peritoneum may supervene.In
contraction, when inflammation sets in or when enteritis and
peritonitis are absent and the attack of constipation is
insurmountable, I have noticed that the symptoms are more urgent and
rapid in their course, and danger of death from collapse greater, than
when these conditions exist in stricture.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.--In every case of intestinal obstruction a
careful examination should be made for external strangulated hernia.All of the regions of the abdomen in which hernia may occur should be
thoroughly inspected, as the symptoms of the two conditions are
identical.A small or incomplete external strangulated hernia may
easily be overlooked.An individual with an old hernia may suddenly
have symptoms of intestinal obstruction, and it may be doubtful whether
the obstruction is due to internal constriction or to the external
hernia.Diagnosis is especially difficult when the chronic hernia is
irreducible in character.If the cause {859} of the impermeability is
internal and below the external hernia, that portion of intestine in
the hernial tumor becomes swollen, tense, and hard, and closely
resembles the local symptoms of strangulated hernia.If the external
hernia is reducible, reduction en masse may take place and a
retro-peritoneal hernia be formed.When the case is doubtful and
urgent, an operation for strangulated hernia should be performed.Functional obstruction of the bowel is sometimes seen, closely
simulating obstruction from one of the structural changes mentioned.Cases of functional obstruction are seen usually in hysterical or
nervous women, and are generally recognized by the history, course, and
termination of the malady.The fact that local enteritis, peritonitis,
or typhlitis, by paralyzing a portion of the bowel, may produce all the
signs of acute and complete obstruction, should not be lost sight of.In cases of congenital stricture or malformation, or the presence of
foreign bodies in the intestine, or acute internal strangulation, or
twisting of a length of bowel, and generally in intussusception,
symptoms of acute obstruction are present.The individual may have been
in perfect health, and suddenly symptoms of the gravest character set
in.Intense pain, referred to some special part of the belly, is the
first sign of trouble.Nausea soon follows, and with it great
prostration; the depression of vital power approaches, and sometimes
reaches, syncope; the patient rolls and tosses in agony; his mental
distress is equally great, and if old enough he is conscious of his
danger and is anxious and despondent.Vomiting succeeds the nausea: at
first the contents of the stomach, and then those of the small
intestines, are thrown up; after a time the vomiting is stercoraceous.The belly becomes swollen, tympanitic, and exquisitely tender; the
weight of the bed-clothes or the slightest touch of the finger upon his
abdomen is intolerable; he keeps his head and shoulders raised and his
lower limbs retracted to avoid pressure of the abdominal muscles.If the abdominal wall is
thin, the violent motion of the intestines can be seen and felt through
it.These painful peristaltic movements of the bowel are paroxysmal and
attended by loud rumbling or gurgling noises.The pain gradually
increases; the patient is very restless and complains of great thirst;
his pulse is small, hard, and frequent, his extremities cool and
features pinched.If not soon relieved, exhaustion comes on; he has
muttering delirium, cold clammy perspiration, hiccough, twitching of
the tendons, and death soon follows from collapse or from peritonitis
or gangrene, or from both.The average period of death is from six to
eight days.It may occur in thirty-six or forty-eight hours, or the
patient may last for two weeks.In congenital occlusion and malformation the history of the case, the
age of the patient, and the fact that the deformity in such cases is
almost always confined to the anus and rectum, usually render the
diagnosis sufficiently easy.Obstruction caused by foreign bodies impacted in the intestines can
generally be diagnosed.The history of the case may show that foreign
bodies have been swallowed or that the patient has been subjected to
some of the conditions which cause the formation of enteroliths.These
stony concretions are usually found in the caecum or colon, and
frequently give rise for days and weeks to symptoms of indigestion,
emaciation, {860} constipation, and other evidences of bad health
before complete occlusion of the intestine takes place.Not
unfrequently, before the sudden attack of impermeability of the bowel
the patient has had repeated attacks of typhlitis, and has been
conscious for a long time of the presence of a tumor in the region of
the caecum or colon.Possibly he has passed on some former occasion
pieces of the stony concretion.Diagnosis of obstruction by gall-stones is often aided by the fact that
the patient has recently suffered characteristic pains of hepatic colic
and by the icterous condition of the skin.Possibly the individual has
suffered repeated attacks of hepatic trouble and has previously passed
a gall-stone.Obstruction from this cause is seen four times as often
in women as in men, and always after the middle period of life.In obstruction occasioned by internal hernia or the presence of
membranous bands, loops, mesenteric pouches, the symptoms are often
such as to baffle all attempts at accurate and certain diagnosis.The
onset of the symptoms is sudden and the course of the disease rapid;
prostration of vital power is extreme, sometimes amounting to syncope;
vomiting incessant and persistent; pain constant and fixed.The most
characteristic symptom of internal strangulation is the very great and
prolonged depression of vital power; it occurs generally in early adult
life.Erichsen states that in twisting of the bowel the abdomen is unevenly
distended, it being tympanitic on one side and flattened on the other.This condition of the bowel is usually seen after middle age.In
intussusception the principal signs are, usually, the early age of the
patient--obstruction from other causes in children being rare--the
suddenness of the onset of symptoms, the frequent desire to go to
stool, the tenesmus, and the characteristic bloody mucus discharges.By
abdominal palpation frequently the sausage-like tumor can be
recognized, and very often the intussuscepted part can be felt in the
rectum or seen protruding through the anus.When invagination involves
the upper part of the small intestine, diagnosis of the cause of
occlusion is almost impracticable.In obstruction of the bowel from fecal accumulation, inflamed and
thickened intestine, stricture, compression and traction, and
contraction of the gut from cancerous deposit, the symptoms are
gradually presented and chronic in character.They are unlike the signs
of acute obstruction, which occur in persons apparently in perfect
health and are sudden and violent from the beginning.In chronic
obstruction of the intestine the patient has probably been complaining
for some time, with symptoms of abdominal trouble.He has been unwell
for weeks, his appetite poor, digestion disordered, strength
diminished, and bowels constipated.The last symptom is the most
distressing of all.Purgatives do not give the relief ordinarily
obtained, but add to the griping, colicky pains, nausea, and general
depression.When his bowels do act, the stool is sometimes liquid,
sometimes very hard (scybalous), or the form of the matter passed is
tape-like or pipe-like.Sometimes, in his frequent attempts at stool,
the only discharge is blood and mucus or pus.Attacks of eructation and
vomiting often take place during the progress of the disease.Stercoraceous vomiting is, however, rare, and only seen in the later
period of the attack.Abdominal distension is slow in making its
appearance, but after a time is well marked, and due more to tympanitis
than to {861} constipation; the tympanitic distension is accompanied by
loud rumbling and gurgling noises in the bowels.After a period which
varies much in different cases, inflammation, suddenly or gradually, is
set up, and all the symptoms of acute obstruction are presented,
grafted on signs of chronic occlusion.We have pain, nausea, vomiting,
great distension and tenderness of the abdomen, peristalsis plainly
seen and felt if the abdominal wall is thin, the small, frequent, wiry
pulse, clammy perspiration, prostration with hiccough, tendinous
twitchings, and death, very like that following a case of external
strangulated hernia.Obstruction due to fecal accumulation generally happens in persons who
have passed middle age, and can often be diagnosed by digital rectal
examination and palpation of the abdomen, by the presence of fecal
tumors, and the history of long-existing constipation with its manifold
consequences; previous attacks of impermeability, and relief by
discharge of enormous masses of feces.Obstruction caused by the presence of some abdominal tumor is generally
known by the history of the case, the fact of the existence of the
tumor being known to the patient or discovered by the physician by an
examination through the abdominal walls or through the vagina or
rectum.The progress of such cases is essentially chronic, but acute
symptoms may at any time come on.Diagnosis of obstruction due to
stricture is frequently made by examination of the rectum and sigmoid
flexure, the usual sites of constriction from this cause.Complete
occlusion from stricture is almost always preceded by well-marked
premonitory symptoms.When the obstruction is situated in the lower part of the colon and
rectum, its precise seat can be determined by digital or manual
examination or the use of a bougie or tube.When the site of
obstruction is above the sigmoid flexure, it is difficult, and
occasionally impossible, to determine its exact locality.As a rule,
when the constriction is in the small intestine the symptoms are acute
and urgent; pain is intense, vomiting comes on soon, and prostration is
early and extreme.When the large intestine is involved, except in
volvulus, the symptoms are generally chronic.In twisting of the gut
the symptoms are rapid and uncommonly severe.The higher up the
obstruction, the earlier stercoraceous vomiting begins.Above the
constriction the bowel is distended and tympanitic; below the
constriction it is generally collapsed.In obstruction of the large
intestine the outline of the tympanitic and distended gut may be traced
with the eye and hand.In constriction of the small intestine the
secretion of urine, as has been shown by Hilton, G. Bird, and Barlow,
is less than where obstruction is seated in the large bowel.Besides
rectal and vaginal examinations, which should never be neglected in any
case of intestinal obstruction, abdominal palpation may also aid in
determining the site of constriction.It should not be forgotten,
however, when a tumor is found--as, for instance, in invagination--that
the bowel may be displaced; a distended caecum may be pushed into and
occupy the left side of the belly.Cases are not uncommon where the
symptoms are so combined and uncertain as to render accurate diagnosis
of the site of obstruction impracticable.Very little light is thrown upon the diagnosis by pain, constipation,
or vomiting when these symptoms are considered separately.Pain is
common to many diseases of the abdomen; obstinate constipation, lasting
for {862} days and weeks, is often seen where there is no mechanical
obstruction; and vomiting attends many morbid conditions of the body.But when these symptoms are combined and examined along with the
history of the case and mode of invasion, they are often characteristic
of constriction of the intestine.Pain in acute obstruction is fixed,
umbilical, and intermittent; in chronic cases it is more diffused and
increases with the distension.In acute cases constipation is complete
and insuperable; in chronic cases this symptom gradually increases; in
intussusception we have frequent discharges of a dysenteric character,
and hemorrhage, sometimes copious, when the small bowel is involved.The bowel below the seat of complete constriction may be full of fecal
matter, and the discharge of this spontaneously or by the aid of
enemata may induce the attendant not to regard the case as one of
occlusion.Stercoraceous vomiting, as a rule, comes on early in acute
and late in chronic cases of complete occlusion of the gut; in
spasmodic ileus or impermeability not due to mechanical occlusion
feculent vomiting is only occasionally seen.The duration of life in acute intestinal obstruction varies very much
in different cases: death may ensue in a few hours or not for ten or
twelve days; the average period is six days.The duration depends upon
the site of the constriction and the mechanical injury to the bowel;
the nearer to the pylorus the constriction, the more rapid the
progress.In volvulus involving the sigmoid flexure, when injury to the
bowel is great, the symptoms are acute in the extreme.After
peritonitis or enteritis begins, progress toward a fatal issue is very
rapid, the patient rarely living more than three or four days.In
occlusion from stricture, compression, fecal impaction, and chronic
intussusception the patient may live for weeks or even months.The statistics of Leichtenstern show that from 5 to 10 fatal cases of
intestinal obstruction occur every year among every 100,000
inhabitants; and according to the mortuary records of England an
average of 1 death from this cause is seen in every 260 deaths.Brinton
reports 1 death from intestinal obstruction in every 280 deaths; his
statement is based upon 12,000 promiscuous autopsies.The first author
states that the statistical reports of the general hospital of Vienna
inform us that out of 60 cases of ileus, 6 or 10 per cent.This report, however, is too meagre to be of much value.From Brinton's
statistics of 500 deaths from obstruction we find that out of 100
cases, 43 are intussusception, 17 stricture, 4.8 impaction of
gall-stones, 27.2 internal strangulation, and 8 torsion.TREATMENT.--There are few conditions of the body which cause the
practitioner more anxiety and embarrassment than cases of intestinal
obstruction, and when the precise seat and nature of the occlusion are
not known the treatment is almost entirely empirical.The distinction,
however, between acute and chronic cases of obstruction of the bowels,
or of acute supervening upon chronic symptoms, can almost always be
made, and a patient investigation of the history of the case, the mode
of invasion, and a rigid analysis of all the symptoms presented will
generally enable the attendant to come to some positive conclusion as
to the cause and site of the occlusion.One fact in the treatment which
cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind, especially of the young
practitioner, is not to use purgatives and irritating enemata, formerly
so much in vogue, {863} in the hope of forcing a passage through the
occluded bowel.The patient is urgently solicitous for medicine which
will open his bowels, but the use of purgatives to overcome internal
strangulation is as senseless and hurtful as when used to overcome the
constipation of external strangulated hernia.These agents only add to
the nausea, vomiting, pain, and peristalsis.The latter is violent
enough already to render coils of intestine visible, and with every
paroxysm is adding to the entanglement and impermeability.It is said
that cathartics in some instances have unlocked the bowel in intestinal
obstruction: these cases are exceptional, and many of them were
probably functional and not structural in character.The only exception
to the rule of avoiding purgatives is as stated by Jonathan Hutchinson:
"In certain cases when impaction of feces is suspected, and in cases of
stricture when fluidity of feces is desirable."Formerly, some of the best practitioners resorted to the exhibition of
one or two pounds of quicksilver, in the hope of overcoming intestinal
obstruction by the weight of the metal.This plan has properly been
almost if not quite abandoned.Crude mercury is very slow to reach the
obstruction, is divided into small portions by the peristalsis, which
its presence increases, and if it should finally arrive at the point of
constriction in any considerable quantity, it is more liable to add to
than overcome the difficulty.The great remedy in intestinal constriction is opium, in large or small
and repeated doses.Its use arrests the vomiting, stops the pain, and
quiets the violent movements of the bowel.Very often by it the
intestine is preserved and the life of the individual saved.No special
dose can be prescribed: it should be administered until slight narcosis
is obtained and pain and vomiting cease.Small doses of morphine, given
hypodermically and quickly repeated, is the best plan of exhibiting it.It may be given by the stomach, but under such circumstances it is apt
to be rejected, or if retained absorption goes on slowly, or possibly
not at all.If for any reason its hypodermic use is impracticable, it
had better be given by the rectum.Opium lessens the danger of death
from collapse: it gives nature an opportunity to untwist the gut in
volvulus, or to unroll it in intussusception, or to cut off the
invaginated part by gangrene; and in internal hernia, morbid adhesions,
strangulation by bands of lymph, stricture, and other forms of
obstruction, it diminishes violent peristaltic action, postpones
inflammatory infiltration, fixation of the strangulated portion, and
keeps the parts in better condition for operative interference, which
in many cases offers the only hope of relief.To carry it farther than
slight narcosis and arrest of the most painful symptoms of obstruction
is an abuse of the remedy.By such abuse the symptoms will be masked
and both patient and practitioner deceived.When obstruction is due to fecal impaction or spasm, the opium
treatment is still often indicated.Not unfrequently, after pain and
vomiting are relieved and slight narcosis kept up for some hours, the
bowels relax and spontaneous evacuation takes place.If not, discharge
of the contents of the bowel should be assisted by the administration
of castor oil, calomel, or repeated enemata of warm water.These agents
should not be used, however, as long as there is pain, tenderness of
the belly, or any evidence of peritonitis, but the opium treatment
continued until all signs of inflammation have disappeared.It has been
proposed to give {864} belladonna in place of opium; in small doses and
carefully watched it may be added to the opium, but should not be
substituted for it.The local application of ice-water or pounded ice to the abdomen has
been recommended; and it is asserted that the danger of general
peritonitis is lessened, and that the strangulation itself has
disappeared, under the influence of cold.If, however, cold increases
pain and peristalsis, it should be abandoned.The local application of
moist heat or fomentations will more probably do good and give a
grateful sense of relief to the sufferer.General bleeding should never
be resorted to, and the use of leeches, except to ward off or subdue
some local inflammation, is of doubtful expediency.Blisters,
ointments, and cups are useless in such an emergency.Cracked ice,
strong coffee, and carbonated water in small quantities are valuable in
allaying thirst and nausea.Cases are reported where obstruction of the bowels has been overcome by
the use of electricity; both the continuous and induced currents, but
chiefly the former, have been used; its value in such cases is
improbable.Abdominal taxis or massage has been earnestly recommended and
frequently practised in cases of constriction.Successful results from
this procedure have been reported.It has been attempted while the
patient was in a warm bath or under chloroform or while taking large
enemata of warm water.Abdominal traction by the use of large cups to
the belly has also been advised.We can only hope for success from
these measures in the early stages of obstruction, before inflammatory
action or fixation of the strangulation has taken place, and any
attempt of this kind should be made with tact and gentleness.Inversion
of the body has also been suggested.The injection of large quantities of warm water into the bowels to
overcome obstruction should never be omitted before resorting to
operative interference.The author has seen this plan in five or six
instances succeed after all other means had failed.Simple warm water
should be used, introduced by means of the common Davidson or a
fountain syringe.The injection should be made slowly, with occasional
intervals of rest, to allow the fluid time to pass through the
intestinal coils.During the operation the patient should be in the
knee-elbow or Sims's left lateral position, and under the influence of
an anaesthetic.One or two gallons of water may be used.In place of
water, the bowel may be inflated with air, introduced by a pair of
common bellows to the nozzle of which a piece of India-rubber tubing is
attached.The addition of castor oil, turpentine, carbonic acid gas,
and other irritants will more likely detract from than add to the
efficacy of these measures.In chronic intussusception, or in acute
cases when fixation of invagination is believed to have taken place,
and especially when inflammation is great, gangrene threatening or in
existence, injections of air or water should not, of course, be
attempted.In invagination, when the intussuscepted part is low down in the rectum
or protruding from the anus, replacement by fingers or sound should be
tried; reduction begun in this way may be completed by injections of
air or water.The propriety of introducing the whole hand into the
rectum is very questionable.In occlusion of the gut by compression and
traction the cause should be found, and, if possible, removed.An
abdominal or pelvic tumor may be pushed out of the way of the
compressed bowel, a cyst punctured, a displaced womb replaced.{865} Great care should be taken to support the strength of the patient
by concentrated and nutritious food, and in the later stages by
stimulants.When the bowels are distended by gas an injection into the
rectum of ten grains of sulphate of quinia will often give marked
relief.It has been proposed to tap the distended gut with a fine trocar when
accumulation of gas is enormous, causing dyspnoea and great general
distress; temporary relief is often obtained by this plan, which is an
imitation of a common practice among veterinary surgeons.Something
more than temporary relief may, however, follow the tapping.In
twisting of the bowel, in internal strangulation by band or loop or
ring, and in some cases of invagination, the constriction is kept up by
the enormous gaseous distension.The obstruction is continued as much
by causes within as without the intestine.When tapped and the gas
drawn off, the bowel collapses, and may escape from its constriction
and return to its natural condition.Tapping is not always certain or
safe.The trocar or aspirating tube may pass between the convolutions
and no escape of gas take place, or it may be followed by fecal
extravasation into the peritoneal cavity.Notwithstanding the risk, the
plan is a valuable one, and in suitable cases should be resorted to.SURGICAL TREATMENT.--In cases of acute obstruction of the bowel from
bands of lymph, diverticula, internal hernia, slipping of a portion of
gut into some opening, or twisting, when the treatment suggested has
been tried and fails, laparotomy should be performed; that is, the
abdomen should be laid open, the cause of the obstruction searched for,
and, if possible, removed.In acute cases a few hours, at most one day,
may be spent in trying the medical means recommended.After that time,
if the patient is not relieved, the sooner laparotomy is resorted to
the better the chance to save life.Acute internal strangulation of the
bowel from these causes has the same symptoms, course, and termination
that acute external strangulated hernia has.It demands the same
treatment--removal of the cause of the constriction.Delay in
performing the operation in the former is as certain to be followed by
peritonitis, gangrene, and death as it is in the latter; and the
surgeon who hesitates to open the abdomen and attempt to remove the
constriction in a case of acute obstruction after a fair trial and
failure of medical measures, is as culpable as the one who delays the
operation of herniotomy for unrelieved strangulated hernia.In rare instances spontaneous self-reduction of external strangulated
hernia takes place; the cases are exceptional, and the fact is no
apology for postponing herniotomy.So in occasional instances acute
internal strangulation is spontaneously relieved; here too the cases
are exceptional, and the occurrence should be no excuse for delay in
laparotomy.To justify the operation it is not necessary that the
precise site and nature of the mechanical impediment should be
determined, although this can usually be done.It is only necessary to
know that the cause of the acute obstruction is not enteritis or
peritonitis, but a constriction mechanical in character, which no
medicine or manipulation or expectant treatment can relieve.When
diagnosis is clear and laparotomy is indicated to save or prolong life
in intestinal obstruction, the aid of the surgeon should at once be
invoked.Peritonitis beginning or in actual existence
makes abdominal section more dangerous and {866} lessens materially the
chances of recovery.To make the operation absolutely the last resort
when the bowel is injured beyond repair, when peritonitis is in full
progress, gangrene threatening, or the patient on the verge of
collapse, is a useless cruelty to the sufferer and his friends, and
only serves to bring surgery into disrepute.If the truth were known,
many of the cases of death following laparotomy should be ascribed not
to the fact that the knife was used, but to the fact that it was used
too late.In intussusception not relieved by medical means the propriety of
abdominal section is questionable.The subjects of this condition are
usually children.Dislodging the invaginated bowel is not always
practicable, and the opium or expectant treatment may end in
spontaneous cure by the bowel righting itself or by sloughing of the
intussuscepted part.It is doubtless true that many of the so-called
cures from the latter process subsequently die from contraction of the
cicatrix at the site of the separation of the slough.In 43 cases
collected by Ashhurst of laparotomy for invagination, 13 recovered and
30 died.The record is bad, and to some extent the heavy mortality is
due to the fact that the operation was put off too long--delayed in
acute cases until sloughing had taken place, and in chronic cases until
adhesion of the invaginated parts had occurred.Indeed, some of the
cases reported were moribund when the operation was undertaken.Recently many successful cases have been reported, and it is fair to
presume that the percentage of recoveries in the future will be greater
than they have been in the past.In acute intestinal obstruction due to bands, internal hernia,
volvulus, or the presence of foreign bodies, as gall-stones, there is
no question that laparotomy should be performed after other measures
for relief have been employed and failed.Death in such cases is
inevitable and imminent, and operative interference should not be
postponed until peritonitis has set in.After the abdominal cavity has
been opened the distended gut can easily be found and the fingers of
the operator carried on down until the site of the constriction is
reached and the cause of the obstruction discovered.If the
constriction is due to the presence of bands or adhesions, they should
be cut or broken up and the gut relieved.If an internal hernia is
found or a portion of bowel has slipped into some fissure or pocket, it
should be withdrawn and the parts restored to their natural position.If the cause of the obstruction is a volvulus, the bowel should be
untwisted.If a foreign body is felt impacted in the bowel and closing
it, unless it can be readily and without danger of lacerating the coats
of the gut pushed on by the fingers of the operator until it has passed
the ileo-caecal valve, the foreign body should be removed from the
bowel by an incision and the wound in the bowel afterward closed by
sutures.If the case is one of intussusception, the invaginated parts
should be pulled out: this is practicable where adhesions are absent or
slight, but if the adhesions are very firm, and it is impossible to
restore the parts to their natural position, the gut should be laid
open above the occlusion, the edges of the opening should be attached
to the margin of the external wound, and a fecal fistula established.If the case of acute obstruction be due to stricture of the small
intestine, which is exceedingly rare, the gut may be laid open, and the
patient recover with fecal fistula, or entorectomy or resection of the
diseased part of the gut be resorted to.The operation of entorectomy
has been recommended by many {867} surgeons, and a large proportion of
the cases reported recovered.In one case by Koeberle six and a half
feet of the gut were successfully excised.The following table by Ashhurst[12] shows the results of laparotomy.It
will be seen that in 230 cases 68 recovered:

[Footnote 12: _Surgery_, p.Enterotomy is an operation originally performed by Nelaton.It is done
by making an incision, preferably in the right groin, above the crest
of the ileum and parallel with Poupart's ligament.When the abdomen is
opened a coil of intestine is found and carefully stitched to the walls
of the incision.A very small opening is then made into the bowel, and
a fecal fistula established.Enterotomy is less dangerous than
laparotomy, as by it there is less interference with the peritoneum;
but no relief could be afforded by this procedure in cases of
intussusception or acute obstruction from bands, hernia, or volvulus.It is applicable to cases of intestinal constriction when the
obstruction is about the lower part of the small or upper part of the
large intestine.It may be resorted to as a palliative measure when
exact diagnosis as to the character and site of the obstruction is not
clear, the case being otherwise hopeless, or in cases of obstruction
where severe symptoms persist and death is near, and yet for any reason
laparotomy or colotomy is inapplicable; or it may be performed in cases
of contractions after failure of patient and persistent medical
treatment.Many successful cases of enterotomy have lately been
reported, and the operation has been earnestly advocated by Trousseau,
Maunders, Wagstaffe, Bryant, and others.In chronic constriction due to
stricture or other mechanical obstructions, malignant or otherwise, not
remediable by any medical measures, colotomy should be performed.By
this operation the colon is opened and an artificial anus established.The sigmoid flexure in the left lumbar region is the part selected for
the colotomy if the obstruction is situated in the gut below that
point.When the obstruction is higher up in the colon or its exact site
cannot be determined, the caecum in the right lumbar region is the part
chosen.In cases of obstruction from the mechanical pressure of tumors,
the possibility of relieving the compressed bowel by treating the
tumors should of course be considered before resorting to colotomy.{868}

CANCER AND LARDACEOUS DEGENERATION OF THE INTESTINES.BY I. E. ATKINSON, M.D.The term cancer of the intestines is used here in a clinical sense to
designate new formations in the intestinal tract the tendency of which
is to destroy life, and has no reference to the histological characters
of the tumors, inasmuch as these are, during life, for the most part,
concealed from the eye of the pathologist.It so happens, however, that
in a histological as well as in a clinical sense the term is
appropriately applied to all but a very few of the malignant new
growths that develop in the parts under consideration, if we adopt, as
seems proper, the opinion of most modern pathologists, that cancer or
carcinoma should only include those tumors "consisting of cells of an
epithelial type, without any intercellular substance, grouped together
irregularly without the alveoli of a more or less dense fibroid
stroma."Carcinoma of the intestines appears either as cylindrical-cell cancer,
as scirrhus, or as gelatinous or colloid cancer.Scirrhous cancer of
the intestines may resemble in appearance and texture the ordinary
medullary cancer, degrees of hardness or of softness depending upon the
predominance of the stroma or of the cellular elements in the
constitution of the tumor.Rarely, and in a purely clinical sense,
cancer of the bowels may exist as a lympho-sarcoma in the small
intestine, and then through progression from the glands of the
mesentery or elsewhere.Primary intestinal sarcoma has, however, been
observed.Similarly, melano-sarcoma has been detected in the intestine
as secondary to this form of sarcoma, originating in the skin or in the
eye.Of the forms of carcinoma, cylinder-cell cancer is the most frequent.Carcinoma gelatinosum or colloid cancer is of great relative frequency,
but it is altogether probable that here, as elsewhere, this represents
a degenerative form of ordinary carcinoma.At all events, it is certain
that it may be detected in many cases where the essential changes
reveal the ordinary glandular or cylinder-cell variety.These forms of
cancer may affect the bowel primarily or secondarily by extension from
adjacent organs and textures, or by metastasis.Primary cancer occurs
most frequently, metastatic cancer with great rarity.The relative
frequency of the different forms of cancer is not definitely known.In
the article on carcinoma in the _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des
Sciences medicales_ (xii.576, 577) cancer of the bowels is said to
constitute about 8 per centum of all carcinomatous new growths.Sibley[1] found that primary {869} carcinoma occurred in the alimentary
canal (exclusive of the mouth, tongue, and the annexed organs) in 6 per
centum of the cases collated by him.Tauchou's compilations of nine
thousand fatal cases of carcinoma show that intestinal cancer was
present in 4 per centum.[2] These computations include cancer of the
rectum.If statistics of cancer of the bowels exclusive of rectal
cancer were available, they would show, doubtless, a much smaller
proportion.[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chir.Transact._, xlii., 1859.][Footnote 2: Leube, _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vii.Any portion of the intestinal tract is liable to be attacked by cancer,
though undoubtedly some parts of it with much greater frequency than
others.Kohler[3] reported that in thirty-four cases the cancer was
situated twenty-two times in the large intestine (the rectum excluded)
and twelve times in the small intestine (nine times in the duodenum).It is not unlikely that in the cases of duodenal cancer the new growth
extended from the pylorus.At all events, primary cancer is seated with
far greater frequency in the large intestine, and, not including the
rectum, usually in either the sigmoid flexure or the caecum.Grisolle[4] declares the large intestine to be four times more often
affected with cancer than the small intestine; that the sigmoid flexure
is attacked as often as all the rest of the colon taken together; and
that the caecum is still more often affected.Where the intestinal new
growth is secondary to carcinoma elsewhere, it is usually so by
extension from neighboring parts; thus, the ileum may become implicated
by contact with uterine cancer, etc., and cancer of the stomach, liver,
kidney, etc.[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, vii.[Footnote 4: _Pathologie int._, 1865, ii.]Cancer of the intestines usually begins after the middle period of
life, and apparently irrespective of sex.Nevertheless, young persons
are occasionally affected, and children sometimes develop malignant new
growths of the bowels (usually sarcomatous), either primarily, which is
rare, or secondarily, by extension from other parts.The influence of
heredity seems not to be well established.There can be no doubt that
chronic irritation may act as an exciting cause of cancer of the
bowels, as it may in cancer of other parts.It has been impossible to
recognize any specific influence from especial forms of irritation, and
it is not likely that such exist.Indeed, the etiological relations of
intestinal cancer remain exceedingly obscure.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Up to a certain period of development cancer of the
bowels will give no sign of its presence; indeed, cases have been
observed where, death having occurred from other causes, the existence
of the malady became apparent only at the necropsy.In all cases the
symptoms are, at first, of an indefinite character and very inconstant.Vague abdominal pains are experienced; these gradually tend to become
referable to a certain locality and to become associated with irregular
action of the bowels.Constipation, alternating with short intervals of
diarrhoea, supervenes, and a varying amount of meteorism is developed.These symptoms may be attended by the signs of failing nutrition.The
body gradually shows the effects of chronic imperfect assimilation, and
becomes emaciated.The complexion slowly assumes the peculiar hue of
chloasma cachecticorum.Long before this occurs, however, the cancerous
new formation usually becomes perceptible as a more or less distinct
abdominal tumor, movable or fixed, as the part affected permits of free
movement {870} or is bound down to the neighboring parts either by
normal attachments or by adhesions resulting from inflammatory
processes or from the extension of the cancerous growth.When the tumor
is movable, it is generally situated in the small intestine or
transverse colon or sigmoid flexure, the other portions of the
intestinal canal being comparatively fixed.It should be mentioned,
however, that portions of the intestines normally freely movable may
become adherent to contiguous parts, as the transverse colon, with the
gall-bladder, liver, stomach, spleen, etc.; the transverse colon
and small intestine, drawn down by the weight of the new growth, with
the pelvic organs, the bladder, uterus, uterine appendages, etc.; and
that, finally, different portions of the bowels may become involved in
one mass.When the duodenum is the portion implicated the tumor may escape
observation or may be indistinguishable from cancer of the pylorus.It
occasionally happens that no tumor can be discovered until the malady
is far advanced whatever part of the bowel is affected.In nearly all
cases, however, before very long the tumor will be detected wherever
situated, but it will often remain difficult, owing to its situation,
to arrive at exact conclusions as to its precise character.Usually, it
offers considerable resistance to the touch, but its features may
readily be obscured by the fecal accumulation that forms above the
constricted portion of the gut and by the gaseous distension of the
bowel.This tumor will be slightly painful to pressure, and the patient
will refer to it a spontaneous pain, usually of a dull aching,
sometimes of a stabbing, character.Percussion yields a sound of
muffled resonance, due to the tubular nature of the tumor.Cancerous
neoplasms of the bowel, and of the duodenum especially, are apt to be
associated with a distinct pulsation caused by the subjacent abdominal
aorta.This may readily be distinguished from aneurismal pulsation by
the absence of an expansile character, by the disappearance of the
impulse that may sometimes be observed when the patient is made to
kneel upon all fours, and by the occasional mobility of the cancerous
tumor.By extension and by inflammatory infiltration the tumor
frequently becomes converted into a conglomerate mass where all
determination of locality becomes conjectural.The tumor is, with very
rare exceptions, single.The symptoms that accompany the development of these growths depend
mostly upon their position in the alimentary tract.Pain alone seems
independent of this, but is at best a most uncertain concomitant.When
the duodenum is the part affected by extension from the pylorus, the
symptoms are indistinguishable from ordinary pyloric cancer.Even
primary cancer of this part may exactly simulate pyloric cancer.The
localized pain and tumor, the vomiting after meals, the frequent
presence of blood in the vomited matters, the progressive emaciation
from starvation, the absence of abdominal distension (a result of the
constriction of the gut at its upper extremity), the gastric
dilatation,--all combine to make the diagnosis difficult.Cancer of the duodenum in its descending part may be suspected when
signs of hepatic and pancreatic obstructive difficulties point to
implication of the ducts, through which are produced jaundice upon the
one hand, and evidences of imperfect pancreatic digestion, in the
presence of undigested fat in the stools, upon the other.In the lower
portions of the {871} intestines the cancer becomes more and more
associated with meteorism and fecal accumulations.Constipation becomes
steadily more obstinate, but there are occasional fluid evacuations
containing blood, pus, and mucus, often stinking abominably.When the
tumor is toward the end of the large intestine--in the sigmoid flexure,
for example--fluid discharges occur with very great frequency at times;
but these are scanty in amount and but slightly fecal in character.In
these cases one does not usually observe the compressed, ribbon-like
stools that are seen in rectal cancer.These symptoms may precede the
appearance of the tumor, when the diagnosis will be less readily made.The constipation will at first be more amenable to the use of
purgatives.(It is said to be due more to a loss of contractility of
the bowel than to the narrowing of its lumen.)Gradually these will
lose their efficacy, and finally complete obstruction of the lumen of
the gut is effected; in which event the symptoms of ileus will develop,
with cramps and vomiting, finally of a fecal character, and the fatal
issue quickly follow.Not unfrequently peritonitis is developed, and
may be of a chronic character or may destroy life within a day or two,
or the patient may die from exhaustion before the obstruction becomes
complete.It may happen that the integument will become involved in the malignant
process, or may become continuous with the tumor by adhesive
inflammation.In such cases an opening may be formed by suppuration, or
the lancet may secure the passage of feces through an artificial anus,
and temporary respite be obtained.Sometimes a sudden disappearance of
the symptoms of obstruction--a result due to the softening and breaking
down of the cancerous mass, restoring temporarily the integrity of the
intestinal tube--may give an unjustifiable hope to the patient; or the
same effect may follow the establishment of a communication, by
ulceration, between the bowel above the tumor and some portion nearer
to the anal orifice.The progress of the new growth soon annuls the
benefits thus gained.Not uncommonly, particles of the cancerous mass may become detached,
and, if diligently searched for, may be discovered in the feces.Microscopic examination may then definitely determine the nature of the
disease.It has been claimed that colloid cancer may be diagnosticated
in this manner even before the appearance of other symptoms.[5] Death
may be hastened by the occurrence of metastatic deposits in other and
vital organs.Oedema of the lower extremities (of the left extremity in
cancer of the sigmoid flexure) will often be observed as a result of
the interference of the cancerous mass with the return of blood from
the extremities by pressure upon the large veins.The combination of
pain, tumor, constipation, tympanitis, progressive wasting, and the
cachexia that sooner or later supervenes, stamps eventually most cases
with unmistakable characters.[Footnote 5: Charon and Ledegank, _Journ.lxviii., 1879, p.The duration of intestinal cancer may extend from several months to
one, rarely two, years, the latter age sometimes being attained by
colloid cancer, the most chronic and least malignant form.MORBID ANATOMY.--By far the most frequently encountered malignant new
growth of the bowel is carcinoma, in one or another of its forms.The
cylinder-cell epithelioma is probably the most common of {872} these,
and, as seen in the intestine, offers many naked-eye points of
resemblance with ordinary encephaloid carcinoma.It is soft, filled
with a milky juice, and may attain considerable size.The tumors appear
as discoid prominences of varying size and number.Later, these may
become fungoid and ulceration ensue.The growths early involve the
whole intestinal wall, and by their increase tend to obstruct the
passage of the intestinal contents.When ulcerated they present a
nodular, uneven surface, situated upon a thickened base consisting of
the infiltrated coats of the bowel.Villous prolongations (villous
cancer; the undestroyed connective-tissue stroma) may project into the
lumen of the bowel and give a peculiar tufted appearance to the part
implicated.One or more points may be invaded by cancerous growth, and
above each will be developed a dilatation of the gut (the result of
distension) containing uncertain quantities of fecal matter, upon the
removal of which the tumor will appear much smaller than it appeared
during life.Scirrhus usually implicates the gut in its entire circumference, so
that a high degree of constriction may result from a small amount of
cancerous infiltration.It begins as small nodules or plates upon the
mucous membrane.As commonly observed, the lumen of the intestine is
narrowed by an annular band of gristly hardness.All the coats of the
bowel, with the peritoneum, become involved, and frequently the
contiguous parts are included in the cancerous infiltration, forming an
undefinable mass through which the contracted channel of the bowel may
be traced, though often impervious to any but the smallest articles (a
crow-quill, for example).The surface of the gut is generally
ulcerated, irregular, and nodular.The walls of the ulcer are irregular
and infiltrated.It will sometimes happen that the autopsy reveals
permeability of the bowel where total obstruction prevailed during the
latter days of life.This may be probably accounted for by the
disappearance of the hyperaemia that doubtless existed during life and
caused more or less turgidness of the growth.Sometimes the
connective-tissue element is less predominant, and gives place to a
more or less luxuriant cell-development; in a word, scirrhous carcinoma
is replaced by soft or encephaloid cancer.This difference is simply
one of degree, but is associated with greater rapidity and extent of
growth.Ulceration is extensive, and one may here also often discover
the villous, tufted appearance of villous cancer, caused by the
fringe-like shreds of stroma entangling cellular elements not yet
detached from the mass.Colloid cancer, or carcinoma gelatinosum, may be associated with either
of the above-described forms as a degenerative form, or may,
apparently, develop as such from the beginning.It is a very frequent
variety of the malady.In 27 cases of intestinal cancer, colloid cancer
was present in 5, as reported by Lebert.It is most often observed in
the sigmoid flexure and caecum, as are the other forms of carcinoma.It
is composed of a considerable mass extending around the bowel.Ulceration is less often found here than in the other forms, nor is
there the same tendency to secondary infiltrations.By the unaided eye
an alveolar structure may be detected, and when the mass is extensive a
soft, jelly-like consistency is presented, together with "a bright,
honey-yellow color."Small deposits of the colloid matter may be seen
upon the surface.These have been described as resembling wheals of
urticaria or herpetic or eczematous {873} vesicles (Bristowe).The
glairy fluid of colloid carcinoma oozes from the cut surface of the
tumor, bathes it, and is to be found in the intestine.These different forms of cancer sooner or later invade neighboring
parts, as the peritoneum, mesenteric and retro-peritoneal glands, and
adjacent organs.On the other hand, the intestines may become invaded
by cancer of the peritoneum and other parts.It has even been observed,
reversing the usual order of things, as secondary to cancer of the
liver (Wilks and Moxon).Under these conditions the symptoms of
intestinal cancer will have been associated with those due to the
primary affection.Lympho-sarcoma will rarely be found as an extension
from the lymphatic glands and involving the small intestine.Melanotic
sarcoma may occur as metastatic from an original melano-sarcomatous
tumor of the skin or eyeball.DIAGNOSIS.--In its earlier stages it is impossible to recognize cancer
of the intestines.After its symptoms have become established they may
resemble those of several disorders.Cancer of the duodenum cannot be
distinguished from that of the pylorus unless evidences of pancreatic
or biliary disturbances indicate obstruction to the passage of the bile
and pancreatic secretions.Previous to the appearance of a tumor one
must often remain in doubt.The alternations of constipation and
diarrhoea, the signs of partial obstruction, the localized pain usually
present, the gradual wasting, will arouse suspicions of cancer, though
chronic inflammatory affections of the bowels may induce symptoms not
altogether unlike these.The presence of a tumor will supply the
additional evidence necessary for a definite diagnosis.It will be
necessary to exclude fecal enlargements of the bowels.The cancerous
tumor will be somewhat painful, hard, nodulated.A tumor due to fecal
accumulation may closely simulate it, and is, indeed, usually
associated with it.By manipulation the fecal mass may be moulded, and
even displaced, and by appropriate purgative treatment may be caused to
entirely disappear.Foreign bodies, mesenteric tumors, and other
abdominal enlargements may offer physical resemblances to intestinal
cancer, but their symptomatology is usually so different that doubt may
be easily dispelled.Syphilitic gummy infiltration, with resulting
stricture, is more apt to occur in the rectum than in other parts of
the alimentary tract.The presence of fragments of the new growths may sometimes be detected
in the stools, when microscopic examination will determine their
nature.With cylinder-cell epithelioma and glandular cancer this is not
common, but with colloid cancer much information may be gained by
examining the evacuations.According to Charon and Ledegank,[6] colloid
cancer of the intestine may be detected before symptoms develop, by the
presence of colloid matter in the feces.In the later stages, however,
the gelatinous change of all the histological elements may occasion
embarrassment, as at this stage the peculiarities of the cellular
structure will have been destroyed.et de Pharm._, lxviii., 1879.]PROGNOSIS.--Intestinal cancer always proves fatal.Death may result
from the debility resulting from the cancerous cachexia or from
intestinal occlusion or from peritonitis.The duration of the malady is
usually not long.It runs its course in from several months to one,
rarely to two, years.{874} TREATMENT.--Treatment must be directed to the alleviation of the
distress caused by the disease.When
the cancer is situated in the colon, especially in the sigmoid flexure,
the operation for artificial anus often affords great though temporary
relief.The diet should consist of such articles in the digestion of
which a large residue is not formed.Milk, eggs, soups, etc.should
compose the principal articles of food.Mild laxatives will be required
to secure the proper evacuation of the bowels, and to relieve pain and
discomfort opium is invaluable and should be freely used.When
obstruction is imminent nutrient enemata afford the most efficient
means of administering nourishment.Lardaceous Degeneration of the Intestines.SYNONYMS.--Albuminoid degeneration, Waxy degeneration, Amyloid
degeneration, etc.Lardaceous degeneration of the intestines is an affection of quite
frequent occurrence in those persons who are the subjects of a like
change elsewhere; for although it has been asserted that it may be
present as a primary affection, it almost always succeeds the same form
of degeneration in other organs.Since, for the most part, it only
makes itself manifest at an advanced stage of the disease, its
importance is usually masked by the grave constitutional condition of
the patient, whose vital forces are wellnigh exhausted by the already
advanced degenerations present elsewhere.The extensive implication of
other organs and tissues in the same degenerative process also creates
great obscurity in the symptomatology of intestinal lardaceous disease,
and is doubtless the cause of the existing dearth of definite knowledge
upon the subject.That the intestines are comparatively frequently involved in lardaceous
disease is shown by dead-house statistics.Thus, Charlewood Turner[7]
reported from the London Hospital that in 58 cases of lardaceous
disease the intestines were affected 10 times; and Goodhart[8] in 150
consecutive necropsies of lardaceous disease at Guy's Hospital reported
implication of the intestines 63 times.[Footnote 8: _Ibid._, p.Although the bowels do not become affected as early as several other
parts, they will almost certainly become involved should the patient's
life be prolonged; and in those cases where death is a direct result of
the degeneration the intestines share with the kidneys the chief
responsibility.It is not, however, until an advanced stage of
lardaceous degeneration that its presence in the alimentary canal is
revealed by symptoms; indeed, many cases do not, throughout life,
betray evidences of the pronounced alterations that are to be
discovered after death.Even in extreme cases there are no symptoms
that would, even with probability, be referred to lardaceous disease of
the bowels in the absence of the same degeneration in other organs and
parts.There are, then, no specific symptoms following lardaceous
degeneration of the bowels.Where the normal functions of the intestines can no longer be properly
performed in consequences of the changes that have taken place in them,
there results a moderate diarrhoea.At first the number of movements
{875} may not be increased; the evacuated matters are fluid and of a
greenish or pale color.Usually, little or no pain is experienced,
though at times and in certain individuals this may be severe and
colicky.The diarrhoea is not always steadily progressive, but may from
time to time disappear.With the progress of the disease it may become
more free and persistent, and in the later stages hemorrhage from the
bowels may be superadded.This may vary in amount, and where, as is
often the case, the stomach participates in the degeneration,
haematemesis may also appear.These hemorrhages may be insignificant,
or may at once assume alarming proportions, and even bring to an
unexpected termination the life of the individual.Already, at the
outset of the intestinal symptoms, the general health will have shown
evidences of profound alteration, but upon the supervention of the
diarrhoea more rapid progress will be observed, consequent upon the
increased nutritive disturbance.The use of remedies in temporarily
controlling this diarrhoea may prolong for months the life they are
powerless to save.So far as concerns the intestinal affection, there is no special
tendency toward febrile excitement.It must not be forgotten, however,
that acute inflammatory attacks of various tissues and organs
frequently arise in the course of lardaceous disease.Though there seems to be reason to believe that mild degrees of
lardaceous degeneration may sometimes be cured, especially when
dependent on syphilis, there is but little hope of arresting its
progress at the late stage when the bowels become implicated.Indeed,
when pronounced degeneration of the bowels takes place the disease is
usually nearing the end of its course; for it is a well-settled fact
that in this degeneration extensive implications of organs may occur
without markedly reducing the patient's general condition, so long as
the kidneys and intestines remain unaffected.The cause of death is
usually to be traced to these organs.Dickinson[9] found that in 35
cases where death was apparently due to renal lardaceous disorder, the
immediate result was brought about by diarrhoea in 13 cases.Presumably, in a large proportion of these lardaceous disease of the
bowel was present.[Footnote 9: _Diseases of Kidney_, Part ii., 1877, p.The degeneration usually affects the lower portion of the small and the
upper part of the large intestine.Occasionally it will be found to
have invaded the whole alimentary tract.As in lardaceous degeneration
generally, the process begins in the small arteries and capillaries and
veins, affecting primarily the arterial and venous muscular coats--not,
however, according to the latest authorities, the muscular fibres
themselves, but their perimysium and the cement substance, the
degeneration being one limited to the connective tissues.[10] In the
mildest cases only some of the small vessels of the mucous membrane are
involved, and no naked-eye changes can be detected.In more advanced
stages the mucous membrane is pale and shows evidence of catarrh.Thickening occurs, and as the process advances a peculiar appearance is
revealed which has been compared to that of wet wash-leather (Wilks).The iodine test now gives the mahogany- reaction of lardaceous
matter, with the tissues affected, or, if the methyl-aniline-violet
test of Cornil be employed, the lardaceous material will display a
red-violet color, while {876} normal structures will be tinged
blue-violet.It is said to be better to make the test near a Peyer's
patch, since the latter is seldom affected by the degeneration, and
brings out, by contrast, the surrounding lardaceous material.[11] This
distribution of the material cannot be considered as constant, however,
since Hayem found the patches of Peyer most frequently affected.[Footnote 10: Cohnheim, _Allgem.[Footnote 11: Wilks and Moxon, _Path.404; Kyber, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.In more advanced stages the surface may become irregular from glandular
enlargement, and ulceration may occur.Microscopic examination shows
the lardaceous material in the vessels, and also in the stroma of the
mucous membrane and villi.[12] The epithelium is not involved.The
degeneration, at first confined to the mucous membrane, extends to the
submucous tissue, the proper muscular coat of the intestines being
often implicated--so far, at least, as concerns its connective tissue.In the more severe cases Hayem found the agminated and solitary glands
extensively involved.Fine branches from affected vessels penetrate to
the interior of the glands.In such cases the mesenteric glands will be
found implicated.The degeneration of the vessels running through the
gland structure causes disappearance of this substance by fatty
degeneration, and occasions a reticulated arrangement of the lardaceous
material, and, secondarily, ulceration.In a similar manner ulcers may
arise in any part of the affected tract.Finally, the lardaceous
material may involve the whole thickness of the gut.[Footnote 12: Eberth, _Virchow's Archiv_, 80, S.The diagnosis of lardaceous disease of the bowels can only be made with
certainty in the presence of pronounced albuminoid disease of other
parts in association with the symptoms of intestinal disorder.Inasmuch as the disorder invades the bowels only at a late stage of its
existence, the prognosis acquires additional gravity.It is probable
that advanced albuminoid disease is never cured; so much the more
hopeless is it when affecting this tract.If unchecked, the diarrhoea
rapidly saps the powers of life; if temporarily alleviated, the
approach of death is more gradual.Whatever attempts are to be made to cure the disease, they must be
through the general system, and are identical with those directed
toward the cure of lardaceous disease generally.Treatment directed to
the intestines must be palliative.The diarrhoea must be combated by
appropriate diet and the administration of such remedies as protect the
surface of the mucous membrane and control the intestinal movement.Bismuth subnitrate in large doses is therefore indicated.Various
astringents may be employed, while the use of opium often secures most
gratifying relief.Preparations
of the crude drug seem to answer better than its salts.The necessity
of keeping the gut free from undigestible matters that may irritate the
already badly-damaged mucous membrane is apparent.Patients with this
form of lardaceous degeneration usually show the cachexia resulting
from profound modifications of nutrition, and their intestinal symptoms
can only be regarded as links in a long pathological chain.Hemorrhage
will call for remedies that under ordinary circumstances are employed
to control bleeding from the bowels.{877}

DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.BY THOMAS G. MORTON, M.D., AND HENRY M. WETHERILL, M.D., PH.G.Diseases of the inferior and terminal portion of the large intestine
may be divided into primary and secondary--the former when the morbid
cause is local and independent of disease elsewhere, the latter when it
is consequent upon or incident to some other bodily affection.Among
the primary lesions may be classed congenital malformations, prolapse
of the rectum, hemorrhoids, and some varieties of new growths; also
diseases caused by local irritations, infection, or traumatism, such as
proctitis, ulceration, fissure, non-malignant stricture, chancroidal
invasion and primary syphilis, including obstruction of the bowel by
impacted feces and foreign bodies.Thread-worms and various cutaneous
eruptions about the anus may also be included among the causes of the
primary diseases of this portion of the alimentary canal.The secondary affections are quite numerous, and may be caused by
direct extension of disease from the colon, as in the dysentery
following typhoid fever, and follicular enteritis, or entero-colitis of
children; by contiguity, from diseases in neighboring organs--_e.g._
ischio-rectal abscess causing fistula--or by changes in the nervous or
vascular supply, such as is seen in spasmodic contraction, paralysis,
epidemic dysentery, cholera, and the action of certain remedies.The rectum, the third or terminal portion of the large intestine, has
no sharply-defined upper limits: it is usually understood to begin at
the sigmoid flexure, opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis; it is
from six to eight inches in length and terminates in the anus.As the
sigmoid flexure is the narrowest portion of the colon, so the calibre
of the first part of the rectum is narrower than the portion below,
where it gradually becomes more commodious, and near the anus presents
a peculiar condition of the walls which gives it a capacity for
remarkable distension.The rectum, which is somewhat cone-shaped, in
its anatomical and pathological characters retains those of the large
intestine with slight variation.Upon the upper or first part of the
rectum the duplicature of the peritoneum is continued, forming the
meso-rectum, which invests the bowel, attaching it to the sacrum.Below
this the middle portion of the rectum (extending to the tip of the
coccyx) is attached to the sacrum by connective tissue only, but also
has a peritoneal investment on the upper portion of its anterior
surface.{878} The third or terminal part of the rectum, which is only an inch
and a half in length, and is entirely without peritoneal covering,
terminates at the anus.The circular and transverse muscular fibres,
mucous crypts, and appendages throughout the rectum are identical with
those above, except that the general muscular tunic is thicker; but the
longitudinal fibres are less distinctly aggregated into bands than in
the colon, being disposed in a more uniform manner, except that, like
the circular fibres, they are especially aggregated between the
sacculi.The fact that the meso-rectum limits the mobility of the upper
and more narrow part of the rectum has led some to locate a third
sphincter at this point, but the existence of such an organ has not
been generally admitted.Van Buren characterizes it as an organ which
"anatomy and physiology had been equally unsuccessful in assigning
either certainty of location or certainty of function."[1]

[Footnote 1: Kelsey, _Diseases of the Rectum and Anus_, New York, 1882,
p.The anus guards the outlet of the bowel by its double sphincter muscle,
which under normal circumstances affords voluntary control, within
certain limits, over defecation.The well-known peculiarity of the
vascular supply, a sort of erectile tissue being formed by the inferior
hemorrhoidal plexus and the passage of some of the efferent veins
through the sphincter muscle, by which they are subjected to pressure,
is very favorable to the development of certain forms of disease which
will be considered among the local disorders.As embryology has thrown
considerable light upon the pathology of morbid growths by
demonstrating relationships that were previously unsuspected, so a
consideration of the development of the lower portion of the intestinal
canal may lead to a better understanding of some of its diseases,
especially those which are symptomatic or secondary.In early foetal
life the third division of the primitive intestine, the pelvic portion,
terminates in a cloaca in common with the urachus; subsequently, about
the eighth week, a partition (the perineum) is formed which divides the
cavity into two portions, the uro-genital sinus and the anal cavity.In
the mean time, at an early period a depression occurs on the cutaneous
surface at the site of the anus, which deepens progressively until it
encounters the primitive intestine, with which it unites at the end of
the fourth week, and the continuity of the tube becomes established.It
therefore is seen that the rectum in its upper and middle portions is
derived from the internal and middle layers of the blastodermic
membrane, while its lower third, with the anus, like the buccal cavity,
is formed by the external and middle layers.In its diseases, then, the greater part of the rectum would seem to
naturally participate in those of the large intestine, to which it
structurally belongs, while its inferior portion and the anus would
partake more in the disorders of the general cutaneous system.This
peculiarity of development also explains the difference noticed in the
vascular supply.The rectal veins are usually divided, like the rectal
arteries, into three sets--superior, middle, and inferior.They are
arranged so as to form two distinct venous systems, the rectal
returning its blood through the inferior mesenteric veins into the
portal system, the anal terminating in the internal iliac.The first
system is made up of the superior hemorrhoidal, the second of the
remaining veins.The superior hemorrhoidal forms a venous plexus which surrounds the
{879} internal sphincter muscle; the inferior hemorrhoidal vein also
forms a plexus, but it is subcutaneous and principally below the
inferior border of the external sphincter.There are, however, a number of communicating branches passing along
the walls of the rectum from one plexus to the other.The internal
hemorrhoidal veins also communicate freely with the branches of the
internal iliac around the trigone of the urinary bladder by means of
small vessels, which pass through the prostate gland and seminal
vesicles.By this method of anastomosis some relief is afforded when
there is an obstruction in the portal circulation, which is such a
common cause of turgescence of these veins, often resulting in
permanent dilatation or hemorrhoids.At the lower part, or at the junction of the middle and lower third of
the rectum, the internal circular fibres of the muscular coat of the
intestine become quite numerous, forming what is called the internal
sphincter muscle; it is nearly an inch in breadth, and completely
surrounds the lowest part of the rectum.It is about an inch above the
margin of the anus; its muscular fibres are of the involuntary or
unstriped variety; in function it assists the external sphincter in
closing the anus and preventing the involuntary escape of the contents
of the bowel.The external sphincter lies directly under the skin and upon the
internal sphincter and the levator ani muscle; its fibres encircle the
anus: arising from the coccyx, they are inserted into the tendinous
centre of the perineum, joining the transversus perinaei, the levator
ani, and accelerator urinae muscles.The sphincter ani is constantly in
a state of tonic contraction, but the force of its contraction may be
voluntarily increased.In the skin and superficial fascia are found
minute branches of the pudic and small sciatic nerves; in the
ischio-rectal space the internal pudic nerve; crossing about the centre
are the inferior hemorrhoidal nerves, which are distributed to the anus
and the lower portion of the rectum; the perineal nerve is especially
distributed to the anterior part of the anus.Thus it is seen that the rectum and anus have vascular and nervous
supplies of considerable diversity and importance.The simplest form of congenital malformation in this region consists in
an anus of insufficient size for the natural demands of the system, but
in no other manner abnormal.The most frequent variety of imperforate
anus is where complete occlusion is effected by the common integument
or by two cutaneo-mucous flaps, which owing to defective development
remain united without forming a raphe or perceptible line of union.The
rectum is not involved, and when the child strains the contained
meconium causes bulging of the part, which disappears under slight
pressure, but reappears when again free.In other cases the occluding
tissue is very firm, dense, with a disposition to pucker or form rugae.The sphincter muscle is rarely perfect, and though an artificial anus
may be made, years may elapse before the child can control the
evacuation.In conjunction with an imperforate anus the colon may
terminate in a cul-de-sac, or it may communicate with the urethra, the
bladder, or the vagina.{880} An imperforate rectum has been known to discharge at the
umbilicus, upon the face, under the scapula, upon the penis or the
anterior part of the scrotum.Sometimes, though very rarely, a common
cloaca has been found, as in fowls, common to the rectum and to the
genito-urinary organs; and still more rarely the rectum has opened in
abnormal sites upon the perineum and upon the buttocks.The rectum may be entirely absent or
it may be incomplete, terminating at various distances from the anus.These malformations of the bowel may be associated with a perfect anus,
or with any of its imperforate forms, or with a fecal fistula.In
occlusion of the rectum the offending structure is in some cases a
hymen-like fold of mucous membrane, which, during straining, can be
recognized by the finger as a fluctuating protrusion; while in others
it consists of a mass of dense fibrous tissue which extends upward from
an inch to an inch and a half: in the former there is always found a
normal anus; in the latter there is either no trace of anus or one in a
more or less rudimentary state.In those cases where the rectum is
entirely absent the intestine terminates either in a cul-de-sac or a
fecal fistula; very rarely the rectum is replaced by a
fibro-ligamentous cord or band which springs from the colon, and,
descending toward the bladder, blends with the connective tissue of the
part.In the latter the pelvis is always in an imperfect state of
development, being much contracted in its lower diameters, and the anus
is absent; and Rokitansky and Curling lay stress upon the
non-development of the pelvis as a diagnostic guide in determining the
absence of the rectum.The passage of a sound into the bladder or
vagina is a procedure of some diagnostic value, as if its point
impinges directly against the sacrum it may be presumed that no rectum
exists.If the malformation is of such a character that the fecal
matter can find no exit, a train of symptoms ensues analogous to those
seen in the adult affected with intestinal obstruction: the infant
cries and is constantly restless, refuses food, vomits, the abdomen
distends, and death speedily ensues.A remarkable exception to this
rule was the case mentioned by Bodenhamer of a child with absence of
the rectum who was not operated on until three months after birth, and
who was apparently in perfect health.At the operation the intestine
was found three inches from the surface, and the child made a good
recovery.Although the statistics of this class of malformations are somewhat
contradictory and confusing, it is safe to state that more male than
female children are so afflicted.The prognosis in the large majority of these cases is grave, for unless
the operator can see or feel the fluctuating protrusion, or can
recognize it after a very slight exploratory incision, he is working
totally in the dark and in close proximity to the peritoneum.Hemorrhage, peritonitis, pelvic cellulitis, and septicaemia diminish
the chances for recovery.Indeed, the majority of these cases are
scarcely amenable to surgical treatment.{881} PRIMARY DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.Prolapse and Procidentia of Rectum and Anus.These conditions obtain most frequently at the two extremes of life,
infancy and senility, but have a very different causation in each.Prolapse of the bowel may be partial or complete--partial when a
portion of the mucous membrane is extruded, and complete when the
entire rectum appears outside the anal orifice.A predisposing cause in
infants is found in the mobility of the bowel--in the fact that it and
the sacrum are much less curved than in the adult, and the abdominal
viscera are more voluminous: this, associated with the undeveloped
state of the muscular system, causes the weight and strain to act
directly and forcibly upon the sphincters, and the extrusion takes
place.It is often excited by allowing children to sit for a length of
time upon the chamber-vessel.It is frequently caused among children by
the presence of vesical calculi, by Oxyuris vermicularis, diarrhoea,
constipation, dysentery, polypi, and by the long-continued acts of
coughing and crying.In adults and the aged it may be caused by loss of tone of the anus and
rectum in chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, or from the energetic action
of drastic cathartics, by urinary calculi, the long-continued use of
enemata, chronic cough, diarrhoea alternating with constipation,
stricture of the urethra, prostatic hypertrophy, tenesmus due to the
presence of polypi, and by the pressure of a pelvic tumor.It may
accompany procidentia uteri and hemorrhoids.An incomplete, reducible
prolapse consists of two or more overlapping plications of
normal-looking mucous membrane, sensitive but painless.In these cases
there is provoked a hyperplasia of much-elongated connective tissue in
the submucous space which undergoes serous infiltration and causes an
oedematous condition of the part.In a complete prolapse the entire
rectum--all of its component layers--is protruded through the anus.In
a recent case the folds of the gut are well marked, but in one where
the bowel has remained in this abnormal condition for some time the
submucous tissue becomes charged with inflammatory deposit which
effaces the plications and causes the bowel to become pale, hard, dry,
and tough; and finally pigmentation occurs and the part assumes
somewhat the character of true skin.These vary greatly in size, from
the slightest protrusion of mucous membrane to a tumor the size of a
melon.Usually they are reduced with ease, but their reappearance is
occasioned by the slightest tenesmus.In old age the soft parts of the floor of the pelvis and the anal
sphincters lose to a great extent their tone and contractile vigor, and
the rectum, also participating in this change, is often unable to
withstand the increased thrust of the diaphragm and the compression of
the abdominal muscles during defecation; which act frequently demands
more exertion on account of a tendency to constipation in advanced
life.In these long-standing cases of senile procidentia it is a matter of
experience, verified by post-mortem dissection, that the fibres of the
sphincters and of the levatores ani muscles are flattened, pale, and
stretched beyond the possibility of contraction, while the entire
perineum is in a state of atrophy.{882} Polypi of the Rectum.There are two varieties of these--the gelatinoid or soft, and the
fibroid or firm.The latter is of rare, the former of common,
occurrence, especially in children under the age of twelve years.The
fibroid polypus is only found in adults, and is composed of dense
connective-tissue elements and blood-vessels.The gelatinoid or soft
polypi are also partly composed of connective tissue and vessels, but
much finer than in the other: they contain hypertrophied follicles and
are covered with spherical epithelium.They resemble nasal polypi, but
are more dense.These growths are not malignant in character, but are
very troublesome, as they are almost always pedunculated, the stem
being from half an inch to four inches in length, which admits of the
descent of the tumor within the grasp of the sphincters during
defecation, and frequently admits of its escape from the anus.Their
presence is not free from danger, as they are very vascular, bleed
readily, and are sometimes detached by the breaking of the pedicle
during defecation.The presence of
these abnormal growths teases the rectum and brings on tenesmus and
frequent desire to go to stool; the feces are flattened, and with them
escapes a quantity of glairy red mucus which has been compared to thin
currant-jelly.When caught in the grasp of the sphincters they often
bleed profusely, and especially is this the case with children so
affected.The presence of these bodies is accompanied with a sense of
weight and uneasiness in the bowel.They may be single or multiple;
they may be round, reniform, oval, fusiform, or irregular; they may be
smooth or villous.In size they vary from that of a marble or cherry to
that of a small hen's egg, and they are usually found about three
inches above the anus, but they vary in position from a point just
within the sphincter to one six inches up the rectum.Their presence is
usually diagnosticated without difficulty, or, if any is experienced, a
digital exploration will reveal them.A child with functional
disturbances of the bowels accompanied with frequent hemorrhages should
be examined for polypus.One of these growths sometimes unpleasantly
complicates a case of hemorrhoids.A rectal polypus is an adenoma, consisting of dilated glands of
Lieberkuhn imbedded in connective tissue, also containing nerves and
blood-vessels, and is covered with the epithelium of the bowel.Hemorrhoids, or Piles.These are usually fibrous when situated below, or vascular when
situated above, the sphincter ani muscle.They are conveniently known
as external and internal piles, but in some instances it is impossible
to say whether these tumors are external or internal.In either variety
they are due to an abnormal state of the blood-vessels, and especially
of the plexus of superior, middle, and inferior hemorrhoidal veins
disposed around the lower extremity of the rectum immediately above the
internal sphincter muscle.The inferior mesenteric and internal iliac
veins receive a large portion of the blood from this plexus, so that a
very free intercommunication exists, around the lower portion of the
rectum, between the general {883} venous system and that of the liver.It should be borne in mind that these veins are destitute of valves,
and are situated in a very dependent part, which is normally in a high
degree of functional activity.External hemorrhoids are found at the very verge of the anus, and, when
not irritated or inflamed, appear like movable, dependent plications of
hypertrophied skin.They appear either singly or in groups, but it is
nothing unusual to find five or six of them together, and they are not
infrequently associated with the internal variety.These pendulous tabs
of integument are very prone to inflammation, and they then become
exquisitely tender, painful tumors, which vary in size from that of a
small pea to that of a pigeon's egg.That portion of the tumor
presenting toward the anus is covered with mucous membrane; the other
is covered with integument; the former is dark-, due to
engorgement of its vessels.These, being composed internally of
tortuous, dilated veins which have totally lost their normal
resiliency, bleed freely on section, but after a time they undergo the
following changes: the over-distended vein, of which each is mainly
composed, either becomes obliterated by the encroachment of
inflammatory deposit or its walls give way and the contained blood
escapes; its serum is absorbed, and the tumor now consists of a
blood-clot, the remains of a vessel, inflammatory lymph, a hyperplasia
of connective tissue, mucous membrane, and integument.It undergoes a
still further change by absorption, and remains a permanent pendulous
teat of cutaneous and connective tissue, bearing no trace of vascular
channels.On account of the extremely sensitive nature of the mucous membrane and
skin of the anus, an inflamed condition of these tumors entails an
amount of suffering very disproportionate to their size: there is
torture in the act of defecation, constant tenesmus, spasm of the
sphincters, a sense of weight and heat in the perineum, and sometimes a
swollen, very painful, condition of the raphe, which stands out like a
cord.Occasionally there is a total inability to urinate, combined with a
frequent desire to do so.When an attack such as this ends in
suppuration of the tumor a radical cure is effected, but a marginal
ulcer of the anus sometimes follows.An unclean and neglectful habit
provoking constipation, sexual incontinence, over-indulgence in
highly-seasoned food or in stimulating beverages, exposure to cold and
wet, and the straining attendant upon dysuria, will provoke an attack.No age or sex is exempt from this affection (Gross).It is claimed that
before puberty females are more subject to it than males; after that
age the reverse obtains, except during pregnancy.Internal hemorrhoids are round, oval, or sometimes cylindroid-shaped
tumors covered by mucous membrane; they are smooth, granular, or rough
to the touch, much less sensitive and painful than the inflamed
external variety, and are situated within the rectum it may be an inch
or two above the internal sphincter muscle.They occur in groups or
scattered over the surface of the bowel.In structure they are soft,
spongy, vascular tumors composed of dilated and tortuous blood-vessels,
the veins predominating over the arteries, their interstices scantily
supplied with connective tissue, and their covering is of mucous
membrane.In color they are dark red, but when compressed and
strangulated by the sphincters they assume a dusky purple hue.After
long exposure they take on a pseudo-cutaneous appearance.{884} The columns of the rectum are the seat of the cylindroid pile,
which is brighter in color and much more arterial in its structure than
the ordinary variety, and bleeds very freely.Anything which causes
stasis and accumulation of blood in the hemorrhoidal plexus of veins
predisposes to this very common affection.Constipation is the usual
cause; and among others may be named diseases of the liver which cause
portal obstruction, pelvic tumors causing engorgement from pressure,
the gravid uterus, labor, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary calculi,
stricture of the urethra, stricture of the rectum, and rectal tumors.Among other causes are horseback-riding, the erect posture, violent
cathartics, seat-worms, dysentery, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and a
sedentary life, with a diet of rich, stimulating food.These piles do not usually cause much suffering; they vary in size from
that of a pea to that of a pigeon's egg, and cause a sense of weight
and stuffing in the bowel; but when they are large and numerous they
cause severe pain, tenesmus, difficult defecation, spasm of the
sphincters, and prolapse of the anus.When the patient is at stool the
tumors are forced down and protrude in a bunch, surrounded and
constricted by a collar of prolapsed mucous membrane: under these
circumstances the tortuous and dilated vessels of which they are
composed give way and free arterio-venous hemorrhage takes place.In
some cases this happens at every stool, the patient losing from a few
ounces to a half pint of blood almost daily until alarmingly depleted.Usually, the protruded piles are easily restored after a motion of the
bowels, and so remain until the next one occurs; but in other cases of
longer standing and of more gravity the sphincter loses all tone and
the piles remain constantly prolapsed.This affection is very chronic,
and the subject of it has to regulate his life with the greatest care,
as the least unusual effort or excess may provoke an exacerbation.Excepting in the worst cases the general health is not materially
impaired.They occasionally become so strangulated as to slough off,
which effects a cure, but this is accompanied by grave constitutional
disturbance.The disease is rather rare before the age of puberty, but
is very common in both sexes in adult life, and is frequently
associated with fistula, polypus, fissure, or carcinoma of this region.In females suffering with piles a free hemorrhage from them sometimes
takes the place of the menstrual flow.The presence of internal piles
causes a sense of weight and fulness and the sensation of a foreign
body or of feces remaining in the rectum, with troublesome and
obstinate itching about the anus.These symptoms, with the occurrence
of hemorrhage from the rupture, erosion, ulceration, or abrasion of the
dilated vessels, render the diagnosis easy.Should the piles not
protrude, they can readily be made to do so by directing the patient to
sit and strain over a vessel containing hot water.If the piles do not
appear, a digital examination should be made.Indeed, it would be
better to make one in every case of this kind.About the margin of the anus the superficial veins are prone to great
dilatation, and when presenting form masses of a bluish color, often
very dark, covered partly by mucous membrane, partly by integument.{885} Dilatation of the Rectal Pouches, or Physick's Encysted Rectum.This is an uncommon disease, generally occurring in those advanced in
years, and consists of an hypertrophy, and sometimes of an
inflammation, of the natural rectal sacs.These pouches are quite small
in early life, and enlarge gradually as age advances, this condition
being favored by the lodgment in them of extraneous substances, such as
indurated fecal matter, inspissated mucus, the seeds of fruit, and
other undigested masses.Constipation, so usual with the old,
predisposes to this affection, as it keeps the bowel distended with
hardened feces.The pouches vary much in size, the largest of them
admitting the end of a finger.The disease is insidious and slow, but
is capable of producing intense suffering should inflammation,
suppuration, or ulceration attack them.Sometimes as many as a dozen
are involved.The symptoms, which are rather misleading than suggestive of the
disorder, are a sensation of weight and uneasiness just within the anus
and uneasy sensations in the rectum, distressing itching, and, after a
time, pain following defecation and lasting often for hours.The pain,
which is aching and burning in character, is not confined to the parts
affected, but radiates down the thighs, toward the back, and into the
perineum.An increased secretion of mucus always exists in these cases,
but the discharge of purulent matter is uncommon, and its presence
indicates the existence of very active inflammation.It is said that even in the worst cases no spasm of the sphincters
occurs.An exploration of the bowel with a blunt-pointed hook affords
the only reliable guide to correct diagnosis: this, as it is moved
about in the rectum, engages the rim of a sac, which may thus be drawn
down through the anus and examined.Non-malignant Stricture of the Rectum.In the absence of ulceration or syphilitic infection this is an
uncommon disease, and very many of the cases of so-called stricture of
the rectum are caused by spasm which always disappears during
anaesthesia.The affection may be described as a narrowing of the lumen of the
rectum, more or less circumscribed, by the deposition of inflammatory
lymph or fibrous tissue in the mucous, submucous, or muscular tunic of
the bowel.It may be due to traumatic causes, such as the introduction
of foreign bodies, the frequent and careless use of enema-pipes, or the
presence of sharp or irritating substances swallowed, as pieces of
shell or bone.It is said to have been caused by indurated feces, but
no cases have been published in which this causation is clearly shown.This condition has also been brought about by various operations upon
the mucous coat of the bowel, such as the application of nitric acid
and other escharotics and the removal of portions of mucous membrane
and of hemorrhoids.Stricture may be secondary and a result of extension of an inflammation
outside the bowel, as pelvic cellulitis; and it is frequently caused by
syphilitic deposition and by chancroidal invasion--in the former by
{886} infiltration, ulceration, and cicatrization, in the latter by
unnatural sexual connection, or by infecting vaginal discharge running
into the bowel.When the stricture involves only the mucous tunic, it imparts to the
finger the sensation of a ring-like elevation or a valve-like
projection, into which the finger enters or beyond which it passes
usually without much difficulty; but when it involves the submucous and
muscular layers, as after the cicatrization of a large rectal ulcer,
the finger encounters a dense fibrous mass which in some cases appears
to have no lumen, but in others will admit only the end of the finger.In these grave cases of long standing there occurs considerable
dilatation of the rectum above the stricture due to fecal detention and
impaction at this point, and hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the
bowel produced by long-continued straining and expulsive efforts.Allingham[2] speaks of chronic constipation as a cause, and says,
"Straining to evacuate the contents of the bowel forces down the upper
part of the rectum into the lower, causing an intussusception; it gets
within the grasp of the sphincter muscles, and this may be the
starting-point of the irritation."Stricture does not usually follow
proctitis, even when the latter is very chronic.The long-continued
pressure of the child's head in cases of delayed labor is said to have
caused stricture of the rectum.[Footnote 2: _Diseases of the Rectum_, p.This affection is a disease of adult life, and more cases of it occur
among women than among men."If stricture of the rectum is found in a
young woman, it is probably due to chancre cicatrices; if it is met
with in old women and men, the inference should be that it is either
caused by cancer or by syphilitic infiltration and its consequences.Only in those cases in which no cicatricial tissue has been
formed--that is, when the contraction is due to the infiltration
alone--will the results of the antisyphilitic treatment contribute
anything toward rendering the diagnosis more certain."Stricture of the bowel may exist for months and years without being
recognized and without causing the patient much uneasiness; more
frequently, however, there is marked uneasiness, with an increased
desire to go to stool and a sense of weight or of a foreign body in the
bowel.It is given usually as
one of the most common and reliable symptoms of this condition that the
feces are flattened, ribbon-shaped, or triangular or wire-drawn: in
true stricture, according to Allingham, this is not the case, but the
characteristic stool consists of small, irregular, broken fecal
fragments.When the contents of the bowel happen to be watery, the
loose stool is spurted out with great force.In this disease diarrhoea
alternates with constipation; the intestines become distended with
quantities of gas and feces, which provoke frequent and severe attacks
of colic; the appetite and digestion fail; the complexion becomes
sallow; the patient emaciates; ulceration sets in, and the patient
slowly sinks from exhaustion.Usually, these cases do not give rise to
much pain, and what there is, is usually referred to the back, thighs,
penis, or perineum.A discharge of mucus resembling white of egg
immediately precedes each action of the bowels.Usually, these
strictures are within two and a half or three inches of the anus, but
sometimes they have been found high up in the sigmoid flexure, and
rarely at a greater distance.A syphilitic stricture by direct
inoculation {887} is found just within the sphincter muscle, and
consists of an infiltration of inflammatory lymph in a circumscribed
portion of the submucous tissue.It is tight, highly sensitive,
thickened, inflamed, and bathed in pus; there are also constitutional
symptoms, as fever, anorexia, and mental irritability.The subjects of
this variety are usually women.The tissues composing strictures of the
rectum of a very chronic character are found to be gray or bluish-white
in color, of very dense fibrous structure, and creaking under the knife
when cut, as a piece of cork would do.Besides the before-mentioned stricture, due to the contraction of a
chancroidal ulcer, is another caused by submucous gummata of the
ano-rectal region, which is very rare; and yet another, the diffuse
gumma, or ano-syphiloma of Fournier, which is the most frequent of all
causes of stricture of the rectum.The diffuse gumma is one of the
later manifestations of syphilis, and consists in "an infiltration of
the ano-rectal walls by a neoplasm of as yet undetermined structure
originally, but susceptible of degenerating into a retractile fibrous
tissue, and thus giving rise to narrowing of the intestinal calibre to
a greater or less extent."Proctitis, or Inflammation of the Rectum.Inflammation and suppuration in the lower part of the rectum are even
more common than the corresponding affections of the caecum, and their
causes are quite as various.In many cases, no doubt, this affection is
traceable to ulceration (perforative or otherwise) of the mucous
membrane; in others it probably originates in the connective tissue
which surrounds the rectum (periproctitis).The rectum, still more
frequently than the caecum, becomes involved in inflammation and
suppuration originating in the various pelvic, and even in distant,
organs.Abscesses arising in the abdominal cavity or its parietes are
peculiarly apt to gravitate into the pelvis and to communicate with the
rectum.Proctitis in its acute form has some symptoms in common with dysentery,
but it differs from it by the absence of abdominal pain, tenderness,
and severe constitutional symptoms.The pain in proctitis is usually
referred to the sacrum and perineum, and there is frequently dysuria
from sympathetic affection of the bladder.This disease may be acute or
chronic; the latter form occurs in those advanced in life.Frequent
attempts to evacuate the bowels, with great tenesmus, heat, weight, and
fulness in the bowel, and a mucous and bloody discharge in the absence
of impaction of the rectum, characterize the attack.Should it be
protracted and severe, the discharge will become purulent.A digital
exploration should always be made to ascertain if any foreign or
irritating substance is exciting the inflammation.The presence in large numbers of Oxyuris vermicularis may excite
irritation and inflammation of the rectal mucous membrane, which is
sometimes very intense.[3]

[Footnote 3: Curschmann, _Ziem.Inflammation of the anus and buttocks, caused by the application of the
leaves of Rhus toxicodendron after defecation, has extended into the
{888} rectum and produced proctitis and peritonitis.[4] "In some cases
of dysentery the pathological lesions are limited to the rectum, which
would produce an apparently local inflammation very similar to
proctitis.The irritation of unnatural sexual intercourse and the
contact of gonorrhoeal poison have been known to excite intense
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the rectum, with a copious
discharge of pure pus, and accompanied by intense burning pain and
great heat of the parts involved."[5]

[Footnote 4: Case of Dunmire, _Philada.[Footnote 5: Heubner, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.Fissure of the Anus and Rectum.The painful ulcer of Allingham is quite a common affection, attacking
women more frequently than men, and no age is exempt from it.Of 4000
consecutive cases of rectal and anal disease observed by Allingham, 446
presented fissure of the rectum.Their usual
position is dorsal, although they may be found at any part of the
circumference of the anus, and just within the verge of the anus at the
junction of the skin and mucous membrane, extending upward toward the
rectum usually not more than half an inch, and appearing as a crack or
fissure, often very trifling in appearance, or a club-shaped
ulceration, the floor of which will be very red and inflamed if it is
recent, but if chronic the floor will be grayish, with hard,
well-defined margins.Sometimes there will be found at the external
extremity of the fissure a small club-shaped papilla or muco-cutaneous
polypoid growth; but this is not to be confounded with the ordinary
polypus, nor is it the cause of the fissure, but the result of
irritation caused by the latter.In other cases the external site of
the fissure is indicated by a very tender and swollen flap of
integument, which often becomes the seat of a small but very painful
fistula.The club-shaped papilla is said to indicate invariably the
existence of fissure.Fissure of the rectum is often associated with anteversion and
retroflexion of the womb.In many of these cases the fissure will heal
spontaneously when the malposition is rectified.However treated, the
result will not be satisfactory while the uterine trouble remains
uncorrected.Fissure is not infrequently caused by and accompanied with polypi: it
may be caused by any accident whereby the verge of the anus is torn or
superficially lacerated--by chronic diarrhoea, by violent expulsive,
straining efforts, as in labor, by the passage of very hard, dry
stools--and very frequently it is syphilitic in origin.The most
prominent symptom of this disease is pain, and this is very severe and
peculiar in character, coming on in most cases not during the act of
defecation, but twenty minutes to half an hour afterward, and is
preceded by a hot, burning, throbbing sensation at the anus: then comes
on spasmodic contraction of the sphincters, and the patient endures
agonizing pain, often for several hours, when relief is gradually
experienced, and no pain is felt until defecation again becomes
necessary.Now, it has been observed that in some cases where the local
lesion is very trifling the pain and spasm are intense and
long-continued; in other cases, where spasm and agonizing {889} pain
followed every act of defecation, no lesion of the anus or rectum could
be found.This led Dolbeau to consider the essence of fissure of the
anus neuralgic, and to define it as "a spasmodic neuralgia of the anus
with or without fissure."The mental depression is so much out of
proportion to the local disease that this may come within Curling's
observation, that "mental causes may produce local disease in the
rectum."Rodent, or Lupoid, Ulcer of the Rectum.This is, fortunately, a rare disease, and is peculiar and distinct from
any other form of ulceration in this region.It is not cancerous,
although bearing some resemblance to epithelioma.As it first appears
it is very like a syphilitic sore, and its situation and the character
of the pain might lead to the supposition that fissure existed.Rodent
ulcer is usually situated upon the mucous membrane, although it
occasionally invades the integument about the anus; its shape is
irregular, its edges sharp and well defined, and it does not undermine
the neighboring tissues.There is no induration about this sore, as
nature does not seem to attempt to limit it or to set up any reparative
action, and its surface is red and dry.It is very destructive, and seems to prefer mucous
membrane, although sometimes it destroys deeply.It does not cause
infiltration; it does not spread by the lymphatic system, forms no
secondary deposits, nor does it produce stricture.It may remain in a
quiescent state for some time, and a certain amount of cicatricial
tissue may form; but it never heals spontaneously, and an exacerbation
comes on which destroys in a very few hours the repair which may have
been the work of many days.This form of ulceration of the rectum is
usually considered incurable; the pain is intense, being compared to
that produced by hot iron, and of course being much aggravated by the
acts of defecation.Patients so affected die from exhaustion and pain,
although recovery may take place, I have known one case entirely cured
by complete excision.Spasm of the sphincters is a usual accompaniment,
and greatly augments the suffering of the patient.Of the four thousand
consecutive cases of rectal disease tabulated by Allingham, only two
were cases of rodent ulcer.This condition may be caused by foreign bodies introduced into the
anus, by indigestible substances swallowed, by impaction of feces, by
pressure of tumors external to the rectum, and by intestinal
concretions.Any condition which causes loss of muscular and nervous
tone in the large intestine favors its obstruction; thus, it is not
uncommon in the aged of both sexes, but especially is this the case in
women, and in them it often follows parturition.Hysterical, nervous,
and debilitated persons are particularly prone to it.The insane, if
not carefully watched and regulated, will become the subjects of it.Impaction of feces is a very common cause of obstruction of the rectum,
and atony of this organ is usually the primary cause, the feces in
these cases being {890} either very hard and dry or clayey and
tenacious.These masses are of a more or less globular shape, and, as
they irritate the bowel and produce diarrhoea, the practitioner
sometimes falls into the error of prescribing doses of opium and the
astringents, misled by the appearance of feculent fluid which oozes
around the impacting mass.The impaction occurs just above the internal
sphincter.Habitual constipation soon stretches the rectum and robs it
of expulsive force, and an accumulation of months of fecal matter is
sometimes found.The appearance of persons so affected suggests
malignant disease: they are cachectic, sallow, dyspeptic, irritable,
and nervous.Vomiting, anorexia, thirst, cough, hectic, irregular and
profuse sweating, are also among its symptoms.Cases of melancholia and
of hypochondriasis have been cured simply by the discovery and removal
of rectal impactions.This condition has been mistaken for cancer,
phthisis, intermittent fever, and enlarged mesenteric glands.Accompanying impaction, and as a result, is spasmodic contraction of
the sphincter ani, which causes the anus to protrude in a nipple shape
and to firmly resist the introduction of the finger.Usually, there is
no discharge from the anus in these cases.Tenesmus, a sense of weight
and of a body present in the bowel, are experienced.Young people are
not often subjects of impaction.Concretions also cause obstruction of the rectum: these are more
frequently cylindroid in shape, and sometimes have a nucleus consisting
of some firm foreign body.Wetherill reports a case of a young adult,
who had been accustomed to the daily ingestion of a substance known as
hygienic bread (this substance is made from the husks of grain, and is
very coarse: it is used to excite peristaltic action), from whose
rectum he removed a very hard ball of this substance which was covered
with mucus, but which contained no nucleus.He reports another case in
which the offending substance was a globular mass of casein, stained
with bile and covered with mucus, and which had for a nucleus a small
mass of hardened fecal matter.Gueneau de Mussy[6] reports a case in which there was an occlusion of
the rectum by a mass of magnesia, which was so firmly impacted that it
had to be removed by a mallet and chisel.A similar case occurred in
the practice of Dunlap of Norristown.Fendick[7] relates an instance of
impaction by a fish-bone near the anus, causing obstruction requiring
surgical interference; which illustrates the importance of examining
carefully all cases of acute piles and threatened abscess.[Footnote 6: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1879, vol.[Footnote 7: _Lancet_, 1880, vol.These concretions often consist of animal and vegetable fibres matted
together about a nucleus, the latter consisting of the seeds of fruit,
fragments of bone or gristle, hair, small coins, or pins."Enteroliths
may lodge in the rectal ampullae" and cause obstruction.Indigestible
substances swallowed with the food may be arrested in the rectum, such
as grape-skins, fruit-pits, husks, and fibres, and where there already
exists stenosis of the bowel a dangerous form of obstruction may be
produced.Jones[8] reports a case of chronic impaction of the rectum by
plum-stones, which gave rise to trouble in defecation, and at the end
of eighteen months produced symptoms of piles; at the end of two years
impaction occurred, and the mass was removed by the surgeon.Hazelhurst
relates {891} a case of impaction in a <DW64> where two hundred and
eighty plum-stones were removed from the rectum after having been there
for a week.The records of the Pennsylvania Hospital furnish the
following interesting case of obstruction:[9] "The patient (a male)
stated that twenty years before he swallowed a peach-stone.Two years
afterward he had symptoms of rectal irritation, tenesmus, constipation
alternating with diarrhoea, and liquid stools, etc.A digital
examination revealed a hard, stony mass two and a half inches above the
anus.Under ether Morton divided the external sphincter, and with a
pair of bone-forceps removed, with considerable difficulty, a
good-sized peach-stone which was lodged in the rectal tissues.The
stone was very sharp at the ends, and had evidently lodged crosswise
and become imbedded.The patient was discharged quite well and free
from all symptoms."[Footnote 8: _Lancet_, 1856, vol.[Footnote 9: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, Phila., 1880, p.Gall-stones may cause impaction or they may form the nuclei of
concretions.A case of impaction is related by Walker,[10] who removed
a gall-stone from the rectum which measured three and a half inches in
its longest and one and a quarter inches in its shortest diameter; also
one by Roberts,[11] in which he removed a gall-stone measuring five
inches in circumference from the rectum of a woman two weeks after
confinement.Mischievous, revengeful, insane, or intoxicated persons
sometimes force very curious foreign bodies into the rectum, among
which may be mentioned hot iron, bottles, cups, bougies, pieces of
wood, stones, a champagne flask, a goblet, slate-pencils, and the tail
of a pig with the bristles cut short.Some foreign bodies introduced
from below find their way through the sigmoid flexure and lodge in the
colon, or they may remain for a long time in the rectum.The caecum is
the favorite resting-place of foreign bodies.Turgis[12] removed by
linear rectotomy a cup which had been forced into the bowel.These
foreign substances, if not promptly removed, set up violent
inflammation.Obstruction of the rectum may be caused by vast numbers
of round- or thread-worms twining themselves together in a mass; and
when this happens in children or in adults of very nervous organization
a curious train of reflex symptoms may be developed, among which may be
mentioned choreic movements, convulsions, pruritus ani, insomnia,
irritability, melancholia, and hypochondriasis.Finally, the rectum may
be obstructed mechanically by pressure exerted from without.Such an
effect might be produced by morbid growths from the sacrum or ileum; by
deposits in Douglas' cul-de-sac; by ovarian disease; by pelvic
cellulitis causing stricture of the rectum; by vesical trouble; by
ascites with hepatic disease; and by various abnormalities of the
uterus, such as inflammation, morbid growths within or upon, simple
retroversion or retroflexion, or retroflexion of this organ in a gravid
state.[Footnote 10: Flint, _Prac.[Footnote 12: _Societe de Chirug._, 1878.]Impaction of feces under some circumstances may give rise to extensive
sphacelus of the rectum and the contiguous parts from pressure.This is
well illustrated in the following case of a woman aged sixty-five, who
was found to have an immense distension of the abdomen from ascites,
incident to a large omental scirrhus.The patient suffered greatly from
the pressure caused by the accumulation of water, and she was tapped.Soon after this an impaction of feces was observed, which probably had
been forming {892} for some time prior to her coming under observation.A week or ten days after the tapping the impaction was detected, but
not soon enough to prevent the formation of a large slough of the
posterior and inferior part of the rectum immediately above the anus.The submucous tissues and the skin, owing to the greatly enfeebled
condition of the patient, soon gave way, leaving a large opening which
communicated with the bowel.The tissues adjacent were oedematous, red,
and painful.The finger carried into the bowel through the anus
discovered the slough to have involved a region of at least two and a
half inches in diameter.Cutaneous Eruptions and Parasitic Conditions of the Anus.These are quite numerous, and they almost invariably produce much
distress and excite painful pruritus, which is augmented rather than
relieved by scratching or friction of any sort.The application of the
leaves of Rhus toxicodendron after defecation is capable of exciting
considerable inflammation upon and around the anus, accompanied by
small pearly vesicles, which, when ruptured by scratching, seem to
spread the disease wherever the contained serum flows.Eczema, when
found in the anal region, is usually due to parasitic growth.Erythema
intertrigo is caused by the friction of moist opposing surfaces, as
between the nates of stout persons, who perspire freely, and infants.The abraded derma exudes a sero-purulent fluid which excites
troublesome pruritus.When this condition exists about the anus it
causes painful defecation and spasm of the sphincters.Erythema
chronicum occurring in this locality is frequently a sequel to chronic
eczema and chronic lichen: the skin cracks, is moist, thickens, and the
epidermis exfoliates.The proximate cause in both of these conditions
is congestion of the vascular rete of the derma.In prurigo podicis
papules appear which itch intensely, and when scratched bleed, the
summit of each papule bearing a small black scab.If not cured, in time
a true psoriasis may develop.Herpes of the anus occurs similar to
herpes at the other mucous outlets of the body, and is usually
symptomatic of slight disorder of digestion.Wetherill has seen a case
of herpes zoster, (var.proserpens,) in which the vesicles extended
from the side of the scrotum along the perineum to the verge of the
anus.This condition was accompanied with neuralgia of the rectum,
painful defecation, and spasm of the sphincters.Furunculi sometimes
form at the verge of the anus, causing spasm, pain at stool, and
occasionally marginal fistulae.Various syphilodermata also appear in
this region.Gross was the first to describe a condition of trichiasis
of the anus--a very irritating complication to fissure--due to a
perverted recurvation of the hairs usually found in the anal region.Villerme states that hairs have been found growing from the mucous
membrane of the rectum.The colonization of pediculus pubis about the
anus occasions a certain amount of irritation.Sarcoptes hominis is
sometimes found in this region, having been carried there by hands
infested with this parasite.The
peculiar tracks or burrows made by this little animal, and the use of
the microscope, make the diagnosis certain.The Acarus autumnalis, or
mower's mite, has been found in the skin of this part, and it is
capable of causing great distress.These do not furrow the {893}
integument longitudinally, but burrow vertically, and may be picked out
of the summits of the wheals, where they appear as small red points.Ulceration of the Rectum and Anus.This is a condition very different from fissure or the painful ulcer of
Allingham--much more grave, difficult to treat, and, in chronic cases,
much less hopeful of cure.It is not an uncommon affection, Allingham's
table of 4000 consecutive cases of diseases of the rectum and anus
furnishing 190 of the disease under consideration.An ulcer of the
rectum may be partly within, partly without, the internal sphincter,
but in most instances is found above that muscle, from an inch and a
half to two inches from the anus, situated dorsally.The symptoms are unfortunately obscure and insidious, misleading not
only the patient, but also too frequently his medical adviser, and
gaining grave headway before a correct diagnosis is reached.Often the
very first symptom is a slight diarrhoea every morning as soon as the
patient rises, accompanied with a little discharge resembling
coffee-grounds; or, again, the discharge is like the white of an egg;
in some rare instances pus is formed.At this stage there is little or
no pain, but the patient suffers from tenesmus--which is not followed
by relief--and a sense of uneasiness in the part.Several stools of
this nature or streaked with blood may be passed during the earlier
part of the day, after which the patient feels partly relieved, and no
more evacuations occur until the following morning, when he again
experiences the same train of symptoms; and this repeats itself daily
for a long time.Finally, these discharges occur in the evening as well
as in the morning, then at various times during the day: his general
health begins to give way; the discharge becomes augmented in amount
and contains more blood and pus; and he suffers occasional pain from
flatulent distension.Local pain in the rectum is now felt, which is
not acute, but is very wearying, is augmented by much walking or by
long standing, and which has been described as similar to a dull
toothache.These ulcers may be multiple, and not infrequently lead to
stricture of the rectum, which condition is indicated by the
alternation of attacks of diarrhoea and constipation.As the ulcerative
process proceeds, nature makes efforts to limit the process, which
causes infiltration and thickening of the submucous and muscular
tissues, and produces narrowing of the lumen of the intestine, which in
time loses its tone and contractile power and becomes a passive tube,
utterly unfit to perform its normal duties.The sphincters give way and
the patient loses control over his evacuations.Finally, abscesses
form, which, burrowing toward the surface, form fistulae, and may
perforate the bladder, the vagina, or the peritoneal cavity.If one of
these ulcers be examined while yet in the acute stage, it will be found
to be oval in shape, with well-defined edges: the base will be either
grayish or very red and inflamed, the surrounding mucous membrane
appearing normal.The rectal glands will be found to be enlarged.Should the ulcer be examined at a later stage, it will be found to be
much deeper and more extensive, with great thickening and nodulation of
the mucous membrane, and looking in places as though the latter {894}
had been torn off.At this stage the ulceration may be partial or may
involve the entire lower portion of the rectum.The suffering is now
intense, and a constant discharge of fetid pus and mucus takes place.The appearance of the anus at this time suggests malignant disease: it
is covered with swollen, shiny, tender, club-shaped flaps of integument
constantly bathed in an ichorous discharge.The entire rectum and
sigmoid flexure have been involved in some cases, while in others
necrosis of the sacrum has occurred.Patients suffering from ulceration
and stricture are very liable to a low form of peritonitis, attended by
intense abdominal pain.The causation of these ulcers of the rectum is frequently very obscure:
some are of syphilitic, others of strumous, origin.Some are of
traumatic origin, but more often the patient was in apparent health up
to the time of the appearance of the disease.The experience of
Allingham would indicate that neither chronic constipation nor
dysentery is a frequent forerunner of this malady.T. Claye Shaw,[13]
in an article entitled "On Some Intestinal Lesions of the Insane,"
says: "After death are found patches of ulceration sometimes so
extensive as to resemble a honeycomb network.The edges are usually
slightly raised, and perhaps hardened; but the ulcers are at other
times mere local punchings out of the mucous membrane, and there is
often a little loose gelatinous material."It is claimed that such
disorders are not infrequent among the insane.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports_, 1880.]It is also claimed that the chronic mechanical irritation from foreign
bodies, impacted feces, and the like exert a causative influence in the
formation of ulcer of the rectum.Like typhlitis, this affection leads
to chronic inflammatory changes in the immediate neighborhood
(periproctitis), with the formation of fistulae and crater-shaped
ulcerations, and to the extensive destruction of the mucous membrane,
followed by wasting and contraction of the rectum.The healing of these
ulcers is much delayed by the fact that the ulcerated and undermined
mucous membrane is irritated by the fecal masses which are especially
apt to accumulate in the lower part of the bowel and around the anus.We find also hemorrhoidal swelling and ulcerations, which may be
regarded as partly a cause, partly a result, of the ulcerative
proctitis.In this condition the most extensive ravages are found in the rectum
and sigmoid flexure.The causes are identical with those of catarrh of
the large intestine, if we except the follicular disease produced by
dysenteric infection.In this form of the disease, at least in its
earlier stage, the form of these ulcers is always round and
funnel-shaped, with distinct thickening of the edges of the mucous
membrane around the ulcers.These appearances may be explained by the
mode in which the follicular ulcerations originate: "The solitary
follicles become swollen, a result of catarrhal irritation, and the
cellular elements accumulate in the reticulum, giving rise at first to
nodules which project above the level of the mucous membrane: then the
newly-formed tissue-elements become necrosed in consequence of the
mutual pressure of the cells upon {895} each other; finally, the apices
of the follicular nodules give way and the ulcers are formed.The
surrounding mucous membrane bends over downward toward the base of the
ulcer, so that the orifices of the crypts look down into the same."[14]
As the suppurative process extends, particularly in the submucosa, and
the tissue surrounding the follicles becomes destroyed, these small
ulcers coalesce to form larger ones, and the undermined edges of the
mucous membrane project over the base of the ulcers, bleed, and become
necrosed.Healing is possible by cicatrization, the borders of mucous
membrane becoming applied to the base of the ulcer and gradually drawn
together by the cicatricial tissue.Still, this result is extremely
rare if the ulcerative process has gained much headway.When, however,
a follicular ulcer of some size does heal, cicatricial stenosis may
result, followed by chronic constipation, just as in the case of simple
catarrhal ulceration.The situation of follicular ulcerations is almost
always in the large intestine, and they vary considerably in number:
sometimes only a few follicles are thus affected, while in other cases
the bowel is crowded with them.[Footnote 14: Rokitansky, _Path.The anus and rectum may become the seat of chancroidal invasion.An
ulcer of this character fairly within the rectum is very rarely met
with, especially in this country, and could scarcely be produced except
by unnatural intercourse.They are of not uncommon occurrence in the
anal region, and are met with in this situation more frequently among
females than among males.Occurring among the former, they no doubt
often arise from accidental contact during normal sexual intercourse.When this condition is found in males, it rather indicates at least an
attempt at unnatural intercourse.Of 1271 males affected with
chancroids, only 3 were found with the disease in the anal region.Out
of 388 females similarly affected, 33 were found with chancroid of the
verge of the anus.The table of Debauge gives 23 cases among 206
females having chancroid in various other situations.The destruction
of tissue in these cases may be very serious should the nature of the
ulcer not be recognized, and stricture of the rectum or cicatricial
stenosis of the anus might result.Ulceration of the rectum may occur
during chronic proctitis; it may accompany advanced states of prolapse
and procidentia of the bowel; it may attack a stricture of the rectum
and cause peritonitis by erosion.Ulceration may accompany hemorrhoids,
or it may attack them and cause dangerous hemorrhage.Finally, a very
intractable form of ulceration may follow the clamp-and-cautery
operation upon piles.When this untoward result is seen, it is usually
due to the fact that the patient has been allowed to move about too
soon.Allingham claims to have seen these ulcerated stumps of piles
even ten days after operation.Peri-anal and Peri-rectal Abscess.The ischio-rectal fossa is peculiarly liable to attacks of inflammation
resulting in abscess, as it is filled with much loose connective tissue
which supports a considerable amount of fat, and is situated in a
region which is constantly exposed to injury both from within and
without.It is a very vascular part, being freely supplied by branches
of the inferior {896} hemorrhoidal arteries and veins; the latter,
being large and destitute of valves, empty into the portal circulation.Abscess in this region is of very common occurrence, and may attack any
one at any period of life.It occurs more frequently among men than
among women, and usually during middle life.Abscesses in this situation may be acute or chronic.The former variety
may be caused by injury to the anus or to the surrounding parts; by
exposure to cold and wet, and particularly by sitting upon damp seats
while the body is overheated; by impaction of feces, constipation, and
straining at stool.Irritating substances swallowed with the food, such
as small pieces of bone, oyster-shell, or the stones of fruit, may
excite abscess by their presence in the rectum.Among other causes are
general debility, an impoverished state of the blood, the scrofulous
and tuberculous diatheses.The disease sometimes occurs in quite young
infants.Wetherill reports the case of an infant attacked by an
enormous ischio-rectal abscess while nursing from the mother, who was
at the time suffering from a succession of boils.Many cases have been
traced to sitting upon the outside of damp omnibuses.Hepatic
disorders, causing engorgement and stasis of the blood in the
hemorrhoidal plexus, have frequently occasioned this condition.These
abscesses are not always situated in the ischio-rectal fossa;
frequently they are subcutaneous and just outside the anus: in other
cases the starting-point may be ulceration of the mucous membrane of
the rectum, with escape of fecal matter into the areolar tissue; they
also originate in the submucous connective tissue of the rectum.The
acute abscess is sudden and very severe in its onset; the pain is
continuous, throbbing, and augmented during defecation; dysuria is
almost always present, and in some cases there is total inability to
pass water.There is local tenderness, dusky redness, and fluctuating
prominence, and, if not interfered with, a rupture of the integument
will take place and the pus will escape externally.Sometimes their
formation is accompanied with a chill or with a succession of rigors:
there is always considerable constitutional disturbance, febrile
movement, loss of appetite, and malaise.This form of abscess is
usually circumscribed and does not burrow irregularly, and sudden
relief of pain and distress is coincident with their evacuation.Chronic rectal abscess corresponds to the cold or chronic abscess in
other situations: it is apt to occur among those who are much
debilitated or among those of the scrofulous diathesis.These abscesses
have little disposition to open spontaneously upon the surface, but
they burrow extensively in all other directions--high up along the
outside of the rectum, laterally into the tissues of the buttock, or
downward and forward into the perineum.The process of formation may
occupy many months, and sad havoc may be occasioned before their
existence is suspected.They occasion no pain nor distress nor acute
febrile movement, but may be accompanied with a hectic condition,
erratic sweatings, and rapid loss of strength.Upon examination of the
anal region in these cases a painless flat, boggy, crepitating
enlargement is the only surface-indication of the probably extensive
damage sustained by the deeper structures.This form of abscess may be of traumatic origin, but more frequently
the inflammatory process arises in the cellular tissue of the
ischio-rectal fossa; in some cases the morbid action is due to
ulceration of the rectum.{897} In either case peri-rectal or peri-anal
cellulitis will be induced.When these abscesses are of strumous origin
the pus is thin, curdy, and offensive.Both the acute and the chronic abscesses of this region are often
difficult to heal, the external opening remaining permanently patulous,
communication with the bowel resulting from internal burrowing and
erosion, with the formation of extensive sinuses in all directions,
resulting in fistulae in ano.This condition occurs more frequently than any other of the
abnormalities of this region, Mr.Allingham finding 1208 out of his
table of 4000 consecutive cases of diseases of the rectum and anus.He
found also that fistulae followed rectal abscess in 151 out of 196
cases, the abscesses which healed kindly and gave no further trouble
being only 45 in number.A fistula in ano is a linear ulceration with a
patulous orifice which discharges pus: it may or may not communicate
with the bowel, and it may have more than one external opening.The
great majority of fistulae in this region are caused by abscess, either
arising in the submucous areolar tissue of the bowel, or in the
subcutaneous connective tissue in the immediate neighborhood of the
anus, or in the ischio-rectal fossa, or in an ulcerated state of the
mucous membrane of the rectum: in other cases it is congenital, or it
may result from the presence of foreign bodies or worms in the bowel,
or from puncture of the rectum by pins, scales of shell, fragments of
bone, or other sharp substances swallowed with the food.Abscesses
leading to fistulae have followed kicks, blows, or wounds of the anal
region: in short, anything which induces an abscess here may result in
a fistula, and as in the former more cases occur in males than females,
and more during middle age than at any other period, the same is true
as to the latter.Fistula is quite common among the phthisical as a
result of malnutrition and septicaemia, aided by the constant
succussion of the perineum produced by efforts at coughing.Of the 4000
cases previously referred to, 1208 were cases of fistula; "of these,
172 presented more or less marked symptoms of lung trouble,
haemoptysis, cough, or impaired resonance in some portion of the
chest."To be complete, it must have
two openings (it may have more)--one in the anus or rectum, and one
upon the surface.There are two forms of the incomplete or blind
fistula--one in which there exists an internal but no external opening,
and the other in which there is an external but no internal opening.In
complete fistula there may be more than one external opening, and this
is in the majority of cases not far from the anus, but it may open in
the perineum or upon any part of the gluteal region.When the openings
are multiple they usually converge to form a common tract or sinus.The
external opening presents nothing to the untutored eye to lead to the
suspicion of grave internal trouble: frequently the vent is so minute
and valvular or shielded by a thin pellicle as to be entirely
overlooked; in other cases a little teat formed of superabundant
granulations guards the entrance: there may or may not be
discoloration, elevation, or depression of the surrounding integument,
and erythema resulting from the {898} irritating nature of the
discharge.Inflamed and suppurating follicles in the integument about
the anus are not to be mistaken for the orifices of fistulous tracts.The internal opening in anal fistula is situated between the sphincter
muscles, sometimes just within the anus, but oftener about half an inch
above; in rectal fistula the internal opening or openings may be at any
point above the internal sphincter.These sinuses may be very tortuous,
with pockets, blind passages, or diverticulae, and are known as
horseshoe fistulae when they commence at one side of the bowel and
ulcerate around it to a point opposite before making an opening.Of the two varieties of incomplete fistulae, by far the least frequent
is that where no internal opening exists, but where there are one or
more external orifices: these do not invariably even run toward the
bowel, but may extend off through the tissues in any direction.In the
other variety, where there exists no external evidence of disease,
considerable damage may be done before its recognition.Fistula may
coexist with hemorrhoids, stricture, ulcer, or malignant growth: it may
be a very trivial affair, with the internal but a fraction of an inch
from the external opening, or it may be long, deep, and tortuous, with
sinuses running in all directions through the buttock.Usually, fistulae become worse when not operated upon, but there are
cases which have healed without surgical interference--others in which
this condition has gone on for many years without getting any worse or
without the discharge increasing in amount.The fluid discharged from a
chronic fistula loses after a time much of its purulent character and
becomes serous and watery; but fresh abscess and inflammation is apt to
take place in these cases from feculent matter lodging in the sinus.Those which burrow most readily are the internal fistulae with large
openings, into which the feces are pushed, with the sinus running
toward the anus, because of their funnel-shape.The presence of fistula may be suspected if there are in the anal
region abscesses which have not completely healed, or which, having
apparently done so, break out from time to time and discharge pus; or
from the existence of a circumscribed hardness or swelling
unaccompanied by an opening which varies in size and is at times
painful; or if there exist any ulcerated moist openings.To make a
positive diagnosis the tract must be explored by a probe: enter the
oiled, blunt-pointed probe gently into the external opening and let it
find its way along without force, bending the probe if necessary, until
it has traversed the sinus as far as it will go; then pass the finger
into the rectum and feel about for an internal opening or for the point
of the probe.If the finger be introduced first, the relations of the
parts are interfered with and the internal opening, should one exist,
might not readily be found.Sometimes the bottom of the tract does not
correspond in situation to the internal opening, but extends beyond it.In those cases where no external opening exists, the rectal speculum,
aided by judicious pressure, will discover an issue of pus from a sinus
upon the mucous membrane of the rectum.In order to illustrate the amount of damage which a small foreign body
may cause when lodged in the rectum, Wetherill relates the following
case, which occurred in his practice at the Pennsylvania Hospital for
the Insane: The patient was a middle-aged man, intelligent, and an
{899} employe of the hospital."Upon examination of the anal region I
found a small, tender, firm swelling, which did not fluctuate, about an
inch to the left of the anus: this had been forming for about a week,
and there was no history of painful defecation, of exposure to damp and
cold, nor of a blow or injury of the part.Without waiting for the
development of fluctuation, I made a free and deep incision into the
ischio-rectal space, and a large quantity of very fetid pus escaped:
upon introducing a large probe I found that it passed up into the fossa
to a depth of four and a quarter inches and turned but slightly toward
the bowel.Remembering the experience of Allingham, that when the pus
in these cases was very offensive there existed an opening in the
bowel, I questioned the patient again as to pain in the bowel or
painful defecation, which was answered in the negative.No
communication could be found with the finger in the bowel and a probe
in the wound, and poultices were applied, liquid diet ordered, and the
man kept in bed.The cavity was loosely filled with absorbent cotton
and the entire wound (apparently) healed slowly, but kindly, and in
about ten days after operation the patient left the house to all
appearance sound.About a week after the patient returned with the
report that he felt uneasy throbbing in the part, and that there was a
very slight discharge.Upon inspection I found in the surface-line of
the cicatrix a pinhole opening which yielded upon pressure a drop or
two of pus; upon entering a very fine probe it passed into a narrow
sinus to a depth of three and a quarter inches, but no communication
could be made with it with the finger in the bowel.Upon withdrawing
the probe it grated over something which felt like dead bone, about two
inches from the surface.I enlarged the opening, introduced a pair of
fine dressing-forceps, and withdrew a piece of the rib of a chicken
about half an inch in length and sharpened at one extremity to a fine
point.Upon making inquiry I found that he had not eaten any chicken
since the development of the abscess.He then suddenly remembered that
while he was at stool a few days prior to the formation of the abscess
he experienced a sudden pang of very acute pain in the rectum, which,
however, soon passed off.This was no doubt the moment when the piece
of chicken-bone pierced the rectum."Hemorrhage from the Rectum.Hemorrhage from the rectum may be accidental, primary, or
secondary--accidental when it follows the ulceration of internal piles
or the erosion of large arterial or venous trunks during the progress
of malignant disease, or when it occurs from the rupture of a rectum
during defecation--a very rare and curious occurrence reported by M. E.
Quenu;[15] primary when it occurs during, and secondary when it occurs
after, a surgical operation upon these parts.[Footnote 15: _Revue de Chirurg.Hemorrhage from the rectum without any structural lesions is quite
unusual, but occasionally copious losses of blood are seen in vicarious
menstruation, and several instances have been reported.When ligatures separate after operations upon those of broken-down
constitution very copious and dangerous bleeding may occur without any
symptoms save a "sensation of something trickling in the bowel," {900}
a feeling of weight and fulness in the part, with increasing weakness
and syncope of the patient, until he expresses a desire to go to stool,
when suddenly a large quantity of blood escapes.SECONDARY DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.This class of affections depends upon constitutional infection, direct
extension of disease by contiguity, by contiguity from disease in
neighboring organs, or by abnormal conditions excited by disease of
remote origin; and are frequently due to changes in the nervous and
vascular supply.Syphilis of the Rectum and Anus.True primary syphilitic chancre of the rectum must be an extremely rare
lesion, and could have been acquired only by unnatural intercourse.There are syphilographers who deny that the hard chancre has ever been
found within the sphincter muscles; but it certainly is not uncommonly
found in the anal region, and oftener among women than men.The table
of Jullien gives 12 instances of this lesion in males, and 1 instance
of chancre of the buttock, out of 77 cases, while among 82 cases
occurring in the opposite sex, 21 were of the anus and perineum and 4
of the buttocks.The French authorities give the frequency of this
condition in men as 1 case in every 119; in women, 1 case in every 12.Anal chancres are easily overlooked, as they occupy the puckered folds
of the anus, which when not opened out to the fullest extent afford
perfect concealment: they may be either in the form of cracks or slight
fissures, elongated ulcerations, or firm papules.It has been claimed
that the initial lesion has provoked stricture of the rectum, but this
is not probable.The secondary manifestations of this disease which show themselves in
the anal region are some of the syphilodermata, moist papules, mucous
patches, and moist papillomatous excrescences or condylomata.The
statistical tables of Davasse and Deville[16] in regard to the
occurrence of moist papules and mucous patches in women show that out
of 186 cases they appeared about the anus in 59 and on the perineum in
40.Bassereau's[17] statistics show that in men these lesions occurred
in the anal region 110 times out of 130 cases.These are, of course,
very contagious.Besides true syphilitic warts, which sometimes occur
in this region, it is quite usual to see the anus surrounded and the
entire gluteal cleft filled up with moist, offensive, papillomatous
excrescences, which remain obstinately so long as these surfaces are
permitted to rest in moist contact.Syphilitic stricture of the rectum
is one of the results of a later stage of infection, and occurs oftener
among women than men.It is stated by Jullien that of 60 cases only 7
were men, the remaining 53 women.They are invariably formed as
follows: A gummatous deposit in the {901} submucosa undergoes
ulceration, and the subsequent cicatricial contraction gives rise to
the stricture.Whether the stricture will be valvular or annular
depends upon the extent of rectal mucous membrane involved in the
ulcerative process.The diffuse gummatous infiltration of the
ano-rectal tissues and the subsequent deposition of contractile tissue
are the most usual causes of these specific strictures.The lower
portion of the rectum is commonly the situation of specific
ulcerations, usually of the secondary or tertiary stage, which lead to
the formation of stricture: this occurs more frequently among women
than men, and between the ages of seventeen and thirty years.Gosselin
and Mason regard strictures as the result of chancres, and not as the
result of constitutional infection; but it is known that ulcerations of
secondary syphilis may extend upward from affections about the anus,
and also that gummata do commonly give origin to this condition.Gummata, and strictures following them, may be distinguished from other
affections on account of the greater distance from the anus at which
they occur, chancres or chancroid ulcers being usually within four or
five centimeters of the anal orifice.Strictures due to gummata are
more apt to occur late in life, but may therefore be easily confounded
with cancer.Condylomata at the anus are often associated with
syphilitic disease of the rectum.cit._]


Scrofulous and Tuberculous Affections.There are cases which yield abundant evidence of struma in the form of
enlarged glands, chronic abscess in the neck, swelling and abscess in
the vicinity of the articulations, and the like, in which ulceration of
the mucous membrane of the rectum has been found: this condition may
result in fistula in ano by erosion, permitting escape of flatus and
excrementitious products into the cellular tissue.A similar result may
follow by erosion of the bowel from a strumous abscess in the
connective tissue around the rectum; both these forms tend to the
production of that class of fistula which has no outlet at the surface,
but which has one or more openings upon the mucous membrane of the
rectum.Thus concealed (for often there is no marked surface indication
of either abscess or fistula), they may remain for a long time
unsuspected and acting as a serious drain upon the already impaired
constitution.The pus in these cases is watery, curdy, and offensive.These chronic conditions are subject to intercurrent attacks of acute
inflammation, due to the lodgment in the abscess cavity or the
fistulous tract of fecal matter or indigestible solid substances.Any
or all of the abnormalities of this region may be complicated by the
existence of tubercular or scrofulous conditions of the system.Tubercular ulceration of the rectum is now a well-recognized condition.Rectal ulceration and tubercular disease of the lungs have not been
found to coexist in any marked preponderating number of tabulated
cases.The frequent association of fistula in ano and tubercular
disease of the lungs has long been recognized, Allingham having found
172 such cases among 1208 cases of fistula in ano.The pathology of tubercular ulceration of the rectum is graphically
described in _Ziemssen's Encyclopaedia_ as follows: "These
[ulcerations] begin in the follicular apparatus with swelling of the
individual {902} follicles and their vicinity from tuberculous deposit.The newly-formed cells become caseous, the superficial layer of the
tubercle breaks down, and thus ulcerations arise of a round funnel
shape.The enlargement of these ulcerations is probably produced by the
constant formation in the base and edges of the ulcers of new nodules,
which themselves caseate and ulcerate.This process of extension, to
which these tuberculous ulcerations of the intestines exhibit a marked
tendency, takes place chiefly in a transverse direction (girdle-shape),
following the direction of the blood-vessels.The infiltration and
necrosis may advance longitudinally, and, finally, the individual
ulcerations coalesce with each other: in this way may be explained in
part the dentate appearance of the edges of these ulcerations.The
ulceration extends also in depth, although usually the muscular coat
appears to be covered by a thick layer of connective tissue: the
destruction advances slowly in the muscularis, but in the lymphatic
vessels which pierce the muscularis less opposition is presented to the
progress of the tuberculosis; and thus it is not uncommon to find
tubercles ranged one after the other, like links in a chain, from the
base of the ulcer directly down to the serosa.The most frequent situation is the lower end of the ileum, but
the process may extend upward to the stomach, or downward, involving
the rectum.There is almost invariably unmistakable signs of
tuberculosis in other organs.It is possibly never primary, but this is
a still-disputed point.It usually occurs with tuberculosis of the
lungs, and when so occurring it is always secondary.The clinical
symptoms of this state are by no means characteristic."Dwelling upon the subject of intestinal tubercle, it has been suggested
by Klebs[18] that the intestinal disease is produced by swallowing
morbid products derived from phthisical lungs--an hypothesis supported
also by the fact that tubercle in the intestines tends so strongly to
spread downward."The seat of the deposit is the submucous tissue or
the corium of the mucous membrane: it is certainly subjacent to the
basement membrane, and not contained in the follicles, as Creswell
taught."[Footnote 18: Jones and Sieveking, London, pp.Woodward, in his article upon diarrhoea,[19] says: "The lesions,
whether mild or severe, are most generally seated in the caecum and
colon, but more or less extensive tracts of the small intestine,
especially of the ileum, are often involved also."He continues:
"Tubercular disease of the lung was noted in nearly one-sixth of the
autopsies of fatal cases of forms of flux heretofore described.Possibly the frequency in chronic cases may be explained by the fact
that protracted intestinal flux forms the development of lung phthisis
in the predisposed."History of the War of the Rebellion_, p.The rectal fissure or painful ulcer may be connected with diathetic
causes, as struma or scrofula: it is doubtful if syphilis should be
included among its causes.Cancer, Malignant Stricture, and Malignant Ulceration.The forms of cancer met with in these regions are epitheliomatous,
scirrhous, encephaloid, and colloid.Considerable diversity of opinion
has {903} existed as to which variety occurs most frequently; but it is
now probably a matter of absolute knowledge that the epithelial form is
the one most commonly observed, and next to that in frequency the
scirrhous form.Encephaloid and colloid are of quite infrequent
occurrence.Again, as to the sex in which this affection appears the
most often, there is much disparity existing between surgical writers:
it is usually thought to be much more prevalent among women than among
men.This is not the experience of many of the authorities upon this
subject, yet the statistics of the Hotel Dieu, Paris, furnish
overwhelming evidence in favor of its preponderance in women.Carcinoma
of the rectum, occurring as a primary infiltration in the rectum,
probably occurs oftener in men, but there are among females so many
contiguous structures prone to cancerous degenerations, as the uterus,
the vagina, the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, tumors and cancerous
masses occupying Douglas's cul-de-sac, that it would seem likely that
they would be more frequently the victims of secondary cancerous
deposit in the bowel or of erosion and extension of disease by
contiguity or continuity.Epithelioma in other situations attacks men
much more frequently than women.This form of disease usually occurs in
middle life and in old age, but to this general rule there have been
many exceptions; it has been seen in children.Allingham quotes its
occurrence in a lad of seventeen, and Gowland in one of thirteen.It
very rarely occurs as a secondary deposit of cancer in a remote region
or organ.In the table of 4000 cases of rectal and anal disease, before
referred to, cancer existed in 105.This disease is usually within easy
reach of the finger, except when the growth is in the sigmoid flexure,
being within an inch or two of the anus or from two and a half to three
inches above it.The epithelial form, when it commences at the anus, is
closely analogous to epithelioma of the lip: from the anal outlet it
spreads upward into the bowel, or it may be primarily seated there.When occupying the junction of skin with mucous membrane it is
sometimes sluggish, and a long time may elapse before it takes on
aggressive action: induration, nodulation, obstinate fissure, or
fungous growth marks its inception; as the condition proceeds,
infiltration of surrounding structures takes place and large, hard,
irregular masses form, which ulcerate, split, and form cauliflower
excrescences.The rectum becomes blocked with fungoid growths: both
these and the cancer proper are very vascular, and frequent hemorrhages
occur, and an offensive muco-purulent discharge constantly oozes from
the bowel.Scirrhus of the rectum commences as an infiltration of the submucosa,
which rapidly involves the other elements of the bowel, pushing hard
nodules upward into the lumen of the intestinal tube: these break down
and form ragged ulcers with indurated margins, and bleed profusely.Its
situation is usually not higher than three inches above the anus.It
has a tendency to invade all the neighboring organs and soft
structures, to bind them to itself in a firm, dense mass, and to form
communications with the vagina, bladder, uterus, perineum, and penis.Abscesses and fistulae are common complications.These neoplasms are insidious in their onset, and when seated at some
little distance from the anus do not excite much pain at first.In the
epithelial form the anus presents an abnormal appearance: it is
inflamed and is covered with irritated, hypertrophied tags of
integument bathed in {904} a sanious, offensive fluid.Difficult
defecation, of which the natural form is absent, with inordinate
tenesmus, a sense of weight and fulness in the bowel, and an irritable
condition of the bladder, are among the symptoms.The feces are passed
in little, irregular lumps or broken fragments, or this state is
accompanied by or alternates with small, liquid, offensive stools.As
the diseased action proceeds, very severe local and general pain is
endured: this is of a dull, lancinating character, and affects not only
the diseased bowel, but involves the entire contents of the pelvis,
shoots down the thighs, up the back, and into the penis: frequent and
exhausting hemorrhages take place; the patient exhales a peculiar
sickening odor; his complexion becomes cachectic; his strength fails;
and death ensues, after a variable period of intense suffering, from a
few months to two or three years after the first symptoms appeared.The
modes of termination of life in these cases are--exhaustion, secondary
deposition, septicaemia, peritonitis, and hemorrhage.Stricture of the
bowel and very extensive ulceration attend all of these advanced cases
of malignant rectal disease.The encephaloid variety is prone to very sudden and rapid breaking
down, and may destroy life within a few months.If the finger be passed
into the bowel in a case of encephaloid degeneration, it will encounter
a large soft tumor occluding the gut: this is a very different
sensation from that imparted to the finger in a case of epithelioma or
scirrhus.In the former there will be felt a crepitating, as though due
to the giving way of a moist, friable substance; in the latter the
touch will perceive dense, irregular nodulations and ragged ulcerations
having very firm margins.The rectum may also be involved and destroyed by any of these neoplasms
in neighboring organs.A middle-aged woman who was admitted to the
Pennsylvania Hospital in a very advanced stage of epithelioma of the
cervix uteri died from hemorrhage from the rectum and uterus in eight
minutes.At the autopsy it was found that the disease had almost
separated the cervix from the body of the uterus, had involved the
cul-de-sac of Douglas, and had eroded a large opening into the rectum.Numerous ends of large vessels were observed which had undergone
erosion.Carcinoma of distant organs does not seem to frequently involve the
rectum by secondary deposition."In 160 cases of gastric cancer
examined at the Pathological Institution in Prague, Dittrich found
secondary cancer of the rectum only twice."[20]

[Footnote 20: Leube, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.In these cases of carcinomatous disease originating in the bowel the
neighboring lymphatic glands are indurated and enlarged, and secondary
deposition in neighboring and distant organs is the rule.The lower portion of the intestinal tract may become involved in
disease by direct extension from the colon, as in dysentery following
enteritis or entero-colitis.Habersham says that diarrhoea arises
generally from an irritated condition of the large intestine, catarrhal
and mucous diarrhoea from slight inflammatory disease closely allied to
ordinary coryza affecting the mucous membrane of the large intestine."In the diarrhoea of soldiers the lesions of the large intestine have
been either those of congestion with varying degree of extravasation or
of ulceration more or less extensive.The colon in the former cases has
invariably presented {905} patches of intense congestion, and in
numerous instances extravasation, the amount and intensity varying in
different subjects, in a few the whole mucous surface of the intestine
having a livid red color; in others tracts of more or less intense
congestion at irregular intervals, as in the small intestines, would be
noticed.The ileo-caecal valve almost invariably presented intense
congestion.The rectum has uniformly presented intense congestion, with
more or less fibrinous exudation.Frequently the presence of fibrinous
exudation was a question of doubt."[21] The entero-colitis or ordinary
summer complaint of infants not infrequently causes a very troublesome
form of proctitis.Besides the ordinary causes of dysentery, Feyrer[22]
states that it is caused by irritation of the solar plexus of nerves,
also by the inhalation of sewer emanations and by the ingestion of
impure water.History of the War of the Rebellion_,
vol.[Footnote 22: _Times and Gazette_, 1881, p."In dysentery the anus becomes bluish-red, and is even marked with
cracks and rents; it is painful to the touch and tightly contracted.In
the later stages of severe cases it becomes large and gaping; then the
stools are generally discharged unconsciously, and the pain is slight,
paralysis of the sphincter ani having occurred.These symptoms indicate
generally that death is to be expected.In some of these cases the
pathological lesions are limited to the rectum.Dysentery may succeed
typhoid fever."[23]

[Footnote 23: Heubner, _Ziemssen_, vol."Pigmentation is common after dysentery, and also after typhoid fever
when dysentery has existed.Pigment-deposits are encountered in the
large intestine in those who have suffered from repeated attacks of
acute diarrhoea or from protracted flux.They may be seated as diffuse
patches on the general surface of the mucous membrane or may be more
especially localized in the closed glands.The diffuse form of these
deposits is more frequently encountered in the large than in the small
intestine, and is apt to be more intense in the former, producing
darker and more extensive discoloration; hence the ash- and
slate-, greenish, and blackish tracts which are so frequently
observed in the caecum, colon, and rectum."[24] Follicular ulceration
of the rectum sometimes follows chronic dysentery and typhoid fever.Woodward has observed that a catarrhal condition of the rectum commonly
occurs in typhoid fever cases.Referring to typhoid fever lesions of
the large intestine, Rokitansky[25] says: "The ulcerative process is by
no means confined to the small intestine; we have seen the mucous
membrane of the large intestine riddled with ulcers.They were many of
them of large size, and had clean-cut, non-thickened margins.This
condition, indicating the absence of reparative action, is not nearly
so frequent as that of thickening and induration, which generally took
place to some extent in the edges of the ulcers.The bottoms of the
ulcers are commonly formed by the submucous tissue.Sometimes the
muscular fibres are completely exposed: this, however, is generally the
result of secondary advance subsequent to the reception of the morbid
action."[Footnote 25: Jones and Sieveking, p.John Harley[26] calls attention to the intestinal lesions of scarlatina
as follows: "I know of no disease in which the morbid effects are more
{906} uniform.Scarlatina is essentially a disease of the lymphatic
system.It is attended with inflammatory action of this system of
glands, in which are included the agminated glands of the intestine.In
28 cases examined, 8 had the solitary glands of the large intestine
enlarged and inflamed; in 1 there was acute desquamation of the mucous
membrane of nearly the whole of the large intestine.In about half the
cases the large intestine was found healthy."[Footnote 26: _Med.-Chir.The rectum and anus are frequently subject to attacks, by contiguity,
from diseases in neighboring organs.The most frequent of these is
doubtless that form of ischio-rectal abscess which invades the bowel,
causing fistula in ano.Various neoplasms having their seat in the
tissues or organs near the bowel may obstruct it by simple mechanical
pressure, or may cause inflammation, infiltration, and ulcerative
erosion.Mechanical encroachment by the pressure of a foreign body in
the vagina may cause grave interference with the normal functions of
the lower bowel.At the out-patient department of the Pennsylvania
Hospital in 1880, Arthur V. Meigs, assisted by Wetherill, removed a
large, hollow, glass ball-pessary from the upper end of the vagina of
an aged woman, who declared the pessary had been so placed by a
physician sixteen years before, and had remained ever since, despite
her repeated efforts to remove it with an ordinary table-fork.Upon its
extraction, which was accomplished with difficulty, a small portion of
its surface was found covered with scratches.Its presence had caused
constipation, impaction of feces, and atony of the rectum.Interference with the rectal functions often follows tedious cases of
labor where the child's head remains long in the perineum.The Effect of Abnormal Conditions of the Spinal Cord and its Membranes
upon the Rectum and Anus."In diseases of the spinal cord and its envelopes there is a great
tendency to constipation, owing to impairment of the secretion of the
intestinal juices.The intestinal movements are usually much affected,
either in the way of increase or diminution, in the former of which the
symptom is a frequent, watery, slimy diarrhoea; as a less common
condition it is even capable of being produced reflexly.Thus in a
patient with chronic myelitis I observed the regular evacuation of a
mucous fluid mass from the intestine as often as his bed-sores were
cleansed; and the like has been seen in dogs after division of the
lumbar cord.Much more commonly there is habitual, even excessively
obstinate, constipation, of which almost all chronic spinal patients
complain.The stool is slowly discharged, dry and hard, and the
evacuation occurs only at considerable intervals and after the
application of energetic remedies.Several causes doubtless contribute
to this: diminution of intestinal secretion and peristaltic
contraction, and probably also weakness of the abdominal muscles of
compression, which is often present.If there is an extreme degree of
weakness, meteorism and accumulation of feces are other consequences.We do not know exactly from what portions of the cord these
disturbances proceed."[27]

[Footnote 27: Erb, _Ziemssen's Encyc._, xiii.{907} "There are also in many diseases of the cord disturbances of
evacuation caused by paresis or paralysis of the sphincter ani.In mild
cases simple difficulty in retaining stool for any length of time
exists.There may be also great disturbance of sensibility, so that the
patient does not feel the call, and even if he possess some voluntary
control, he is surprised by the discharge, of which he feels
nothing."[28]

[Footnote 28: Erb, _loc.The sphincter ani is affected in cases of myelitis, the usual symptoms
being those of paralysis; the same is true in softening of the cord or
myelo-malacia, and there is also diminished reflex excitability of the
anus.Paralysis of the bladder and rectum is often delayed in cases of slow
compression of the cord; but if the compression exists to any
considerable extent, involuntary discharges of urine and feces will be
sure to occur.A pressure-myelitis of the lumbar portion of the cord
causes paralysis of the bowel, and in the later stage of some cases of
bulbar paralysis it also occurs.Early in the course of spinal meningitis there exists a spasmodic
condition of the sphincters: these muscles are also paralyzed in spinal
and in meningeal hemorrhage, and from the pressure of tumors upon the
cord giving rise to paraplegia."In acute ascending paralysis the
bladder and rectum are generally quite undisturbed in their functions.In hemiplegia and in hemi-paraplegia specialis disturbances in the
evacuation of the bladder and bowels are almost always present, and in
the acute traumatic cases it is especially common to find severe
paralytic symptoms at the beginning of the attack (complete retention
or complete incontinence, involuntary stools, etc.), which, however,
generally soon recede and give place to lighter, more permanent
trouble, as weakness of the sphincters."[29]

[Footnote 29: Ibid., _loc.The following is an extract from Gower's _Diagnosis and Diseases of the
Spinal Cord_:[30] "The spinal cord possesses centres, situated in the
lumbar enlargement, which preside over the action of the bladder and
rectum.They are probably complex reflex centres: that for the
sphincter ani is the more simple.... But if the volitional path in the
cord is damaged above the lumbar centres, the will can no longer
influence the reflex processes: as soon as the feces irritate the
rectum they are expelled by the reflex mechanism.... If the damage to
the cord involves also the sensory tract, the patient is unconscious of
this process; if the sensory tract is unaffected, the patient is aware
of the action of the bladder or bowel, but cannot control it.It is
often said that there is permanent relaxation of the sphincters, but
this is true only when the lumbar centres are inactive or destroyed.In
this condition evacuation occurs as soon as feces or urine enter; the
urine escapes continuously instead of being expelled at intervals....
We may, however, distinguish between the two states of the rectum by
the introduction of the finger: if the lumbar centre is inactive, there
is a momentary contraction due to local stimulation of the sphincter,
and then permanent relaxation.If, however, the reflex centre and motor
nerves from it are intact, the introduction of the finger is followed
first by relaxation, and then by gentle, firm, tonic contraction."[Footnote 30: London, 1880, p.{908} Morton has at this time in his wards at the Pennsylvania Hospital
two cases of rectal paresis following fracture of the vertebrae.The
first, a lad aged nineteen years, while crossing the Atlantic was
struck during a gale by a spar upon the back about the region of the
lower dorsal vertebrae.From the deformity and from other symptoms
there was undoubtedly a fracture destructive to the normal functions of
the cord.Upon the arrival of the steamer, some ten days after the
accident, the lad was brought to the hospital, where he has remained
for the past eighteen months.Total palsy of sensation and motion has
continued from the time of the accident to the present day, and extends
from the navel downward: the sphincter ani is constantly but feebly
contracted; the finger, when pressed into the anus, encounters slight
resistance, which continues during and after the simple passage of the
finger; very slight pressure, however, against the sphincter causes a
very marked relaxation, which continues so long as this is kept up.With the removal of the finger the sphincter slowly and fairly
contracts.The second case is also one of vertebral fracture which has
been in the hospital about ten months.In this instance the sphincter
is always found contracted, but it readily yields under finger
pressure, and contracts quickly and regularly in the absence of this
pressure.Constipation and rectal impaction readily occur, and the
bowel requires to be regularly emptied.In another case, at the
Episcopal Hospital, under the care of W. B. Hopkins, there is fracture
of the spine, with total palsy below the seat of injury.The margins of
the anus were found in apposition, but in no firm contraction: mere
contact of the finger appeared to have little or no effect, but slight
pressure upon the sphincter caused a contraction, and very moderate
pressure upon the anus after the introduction of the finger produced
excessive dilatation.The action of the sphincter was in all respects
very tardy.Two recent cases (August, 1883) of fracture of the dorsal vertebrae
have been admitted into the Pennsylvania Hospital.One, a lad aged ten
years, was struck by a bale of cotton which fell upon him; the other, a
man aged thirty years, fell from a second-story window.In both cases
total palsy occurred at once upon the receipt of injury, and in each
the same conditions of the anus have obtained as before described.In the convulsive attacks incident to epilepsy the sphincters of the
bowel and urinary bladder are relaxed and the discharges are
involuntary; probably, also, one of the first symptoms indicative of
tumor of the base of the brain is recognized in involuntary rectal
evacuations.Rectal incontinence may be also due to tabes, while atony
and constipation are sometimes noticed as a result of excessive
intellectual exertion (DaCosta).The same may be said of chronic
lesions of the brain and spinal cord.Paresis of the rectum has been
noticed as a result of chronic congestions of the heart and in hepatic
disease.Allingham has observed failing nerve-power as a cause of
rectal atony: the latter, with constipation, is one of the commonest
troubles attendant upon melancholia and the chronic forms of insanity.Seeley of Ovid, New York, related to Morton a case of paraplegia with
rectal paresis and dysenteric symptoms from malarial poisoning in a
married lady aged thirty years.An examination revealed an immense
rectal impaction.A free administration of quinia was followed by
complete recovery in a few weeks.{909} Spasm or Spasmodic Contraction of the Rectum and Anus.Apart from those cases in which spasm is induced by the irritating
stools of diarrhoea and dysentery, or by local ulcerations, fissures of
the anus, and intestinal worms, there are those in which painful spasm
occurs, due to the presence of a vesical calculus: it is also caused by
urethral stricture, impaction of feces, irritations and inflammations
involving the bladder or the adjacent organs.Spasm is also seen in
nervous females, without constipation; also in the varied irritations
of the female genito-urinary apparatus.In cases where spasm is due to
rectal impaction retraction of the anus is frequently seen.This most painful, distressing, and obstinate affection belongs to the
class of neuroses, and is simply functional in character, without the
least structural change in the skin or mucous membrane of the anus or
rectum: the itching may be confined to the former or it may extend into
the latter.It may be brought about by a constipated state of the
bowels, but it is more often due to derangements of the digestive
apparatus.Sufferers from pruritus ani are generally dyspeptics, although the
malady is observed in persons who are otherwise in most robust health.Overwork, mental and physical exhaustion, have been charged with
producing pruritus, and in some instances spinal irritation seems to
have been unquestionably the exciting cause: now and again, pruritus
ani has been produced by the pregnant condition, and in some cases this
malady has persisted during the entire period of utero-gestation.Intestinal worms, uterine maladies, rheumatism, and especially gout,
have unquestionably been exciting causes.Some years since a gentleman
having the most intense pruritus, which defied all treatment, was
suddenly relieved of all former distressing symptoms by the passage of
a small vesical calculus, the presence of which had never been
suspected, as no vesical symptoms had at any time existed.Some of the
most aggravated instances of anal pruritus are found in those far
advanced in diabetes mellitus.The nerves of the lumbar plexus in rare
instances have suffered from compression, more or less severe, from
fecal accumulations; in one case of spinal curvature detailed by
Portal[31] the rectum at its upper part was so narrowed by the
encroachment of the false ribs that excessive fecal accumulation
occurred which gave rise to remote pain in the great toe.[Footnote 31: _Cours d'Anatomie medicale_, tome iv.It seems to be unquestionable that there are instances of pure
neuralgia of the rectum, for in such cases the most carefully conducted
explorations have failed in demonstrating any evidences of disease.The
pain is doubtless reflex, due to depressing causes, to atmospheric
conditions, or to exposure to cold and wet.Neuralgia of the rectum has
also been noticed in malarial {910} poisoning, and especially in those
who have long been victims of intermittent fever.Neuralgia in this
region of the body is also due to general causes, as witnessed in cases
of rheumatism and of the gouty diathesis.Patients now and again
complain of "violent and painful pressure in the rectum, conjoined with
active pains in the perineum and anus and in the sexual parts: these
symptoms probably have a neuralgic character."[32] In many nervous
disorders, but especially in spinal irritations or inflammation, the
rectum is invaded by pains of a neuralgic nature more or less severe,
which are undoubtedly only functional in character.But 12 cases of
neuralgia were observed out of 4000 cases of rectal disease.Anstie[33]
says: "It needs some very powerful irritant to set up neuralgia in any
portion of the alimentary canal:... this condition has been described
by Ashton.... In one case the patient complained of acute, paroxysmal,
cutting pain extending about an inch within the rectum.... The cause of
this attack was his getting chilled from sitting in his wet clothes."Curling says that constantly directing the mind to this part of the
body will excite congestion and disease, possibly by producing abnormal
sensations, itching, and superficial inflammation.[Footnote 32: Erb, _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vol.[Footnote 33: _Neuralgia and its Counterfeits_, p."In patients with piles hyperaemia of the spinal cord may become
habitual, returning regularly and frequently, and this may lead by
degrees to severer disturbance by the development of chronic
inflammation and proliferation."[34] Among some of the reflex troubles
arising from rectal disease are--sterility in women, simulation of
uterine disease, pruritus ani, pseudo-sciatica, pains in the legs and
feet, and impairment of co-ordination in the muscles of defecation.There is a case reported[35] of a curious pain in the sole of a foot
caused by rectal disease; and another[36] in which irritation of the
eyes was caused by hemorrhoids.[Footnote 34: _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vol.Times and Gazette_, 1868, vol.[Footnote 36: Cooper, _Lancet_, 1862, i. p.There are some cases occasionally met with of so-called irritable
rectum.Now, a rectum may be irritable because irritated, but in some
of these instances there is no apparent cause.There occur frequent,
small stools expelled with force, but without pain: there must be
abnormal peristaltic action to cause this condition.The Effects of Cholera and of Certain Poisons and Remedies upon the
Rectum.After death from cholera there is found congestion and a swollen state
of the mucous membrane of the rectum: in some cases the epithelium of
the entire alimentary canal is almost absent.In slow poisoning by
arsenic the bowels show ulceration, but more particularly the rectum.After phosphorus-poisoning the large intestine has been found inflamed
and contracted to the calibre of a quill.Among the effects of copper
have been seen ulceration and a peculiar green staining of the rectum;
of lead, no marked change of the mucous membrane except, in some
instances, hardening, but the muscularis was in an advanced state of
hardening and contraction.The action of croton oil is to render the
mucosa very soft and friable.Extensive destruction of the mucous
membrane of the rectum has resulted {911} from poisoning by bichromate
of potassium.The mineral acids and the caustic alkalies, when not
immediately fatal, cause corrosive ulceration of the rectum; the
soluble salts of zinc, tin, bismuth, and antimony produce a like
effect.Corrosive sublimate in its action upon the large intestine
produces a dysenteric condition; similar in their effects are
colocynth, jalap, elaterium, and cantharides.Strychnia causes a deep
violet congestion; alcohol, congestion and thickening; and tobacco,
redness of the mucous membrane with great engorgement of the vessels of
the rectum.One of the results of the long-continued abuse of morphia
is a catarrhal condition of the large intestine, accompanied with
exfoliation of the intestinal epithelium.Some persons are very
susceptible to the action of jaborandi, and in such its exhibition is
followed by hyperaesthesia and dull pain in the rectum and the urethra.It is interesting to note that an abnormal condition in the rectum may
cause extensive disease in a remote organ; thus, a stricture of the
rectum may cause abscess in the liver.Wilkes[37] exhibited at the
Pathological Society a specimen in which an abscess, a diffuse,
purulent infiltration of the liver, and a gall-bladder filled with
purulent bile were distinctly traceable to the suppuration arising from
an ulcerating stricture of the rectum consisting of dense fibrous
tissue situated about four inches from the anus of a man aged
thirty-seven years."Any form of suppurative intestinal disease seems
capable of producing hepatic abscesses of a metastatic or pyaemic
character."[38] It has not been found, however, that tubercular
ulceration of the intestines has ever given rise to hepatic abscess.[Footnote 38: Darley, _On the Liver_, 1883, p.Examinations and explorations of the abdominal viscera by the hand
introduced into the rectum, having for their object the detection of
tumors or morbid growths, are procedures which have fallen into merited
disrepute, and are mentioned here in condemnation.However, some years
since, Morton, in consultation with (J. Forsythe) Meigs, satisfactorily
demonstrated the absence of a suspected renal calculus by this method.The distension of the rectum with water, either free or contained in a
rubber bag, in order to facilitate operations upon the pelvic viscera,
has been lately brought into notice by Garson at a meeting of the
British Medical Association.The most significant point brought out at
the meeting was that the water-distended rectum displaced the distended
urinary bladder upward and forward until it occupied a position quite
outside of the pelvic cavity, carrying along with it the peritoneum
both in front and behind.By this method of distension it was found
possible so to raise the peritoneum in front of the bladder as to leave
a clear working space of four centimeters between the upper border of
the symphysis pubis and the edge of the peritoneum: this may prove
useful in suprapubic lithotomy, as well as in operations upon the
uterus and its appendages during laparotomy.Daniel went back to the garden.RESUME OF THE THERAPEUTICAL AND SURGICAL TREATMENT.FISSURE OF THE ANUS, in its true sense, is not to be confounded with
ulcerations either slight and superficial in extent, or with more grave
ulcerations involving not only the anus, but the mucous membrane of the
{912} rectum also.The true fissure is a mere linear crack or abrasion
or superficial ulceration.The pain accompanying this condition is out
of proportion to the length and depth of the fissure, varying from
slight uneasiness to as severe suffering as that caused by a deep and
extensive ulceration.The treatment to be adopted in such cases is first to regulate the
bowels and to insist upon a scrupulous cleansing of the part after each
evacuation.Much sitting is to be avoided and a sedentary mode of life
is to be discouraged.Sometimes a few light topical applications of the
solid nitrate of silver will bring about a cure, or a lotion of the
same of the strength of from two to ten grains to the ounce of water
should be applied with a camel's-hair brush every other morning.The
ointment of the oxide of zinc, combined with any of the local
anaesthetics, will be found useful.As a dernier ressort in obstinate
cases an incision should be made through the fissure, together with a
thorough dilatation of the anal sphincter.ULCER OF THE RECTUM, OR THE GRAVER FORM OF FISSURE OF THE ANUS.--In the
milder forms of this very common and painful affection the treatment
consists in thorough cleanliness of the part; the ulcerated surface may
be cauterized with nitrate of silver, and subsequently the application
of the red precipitate ointment or the lotio nigra.Should a vaginal
discharge exist, treatment should be instituted with a view to its
arrest, as the irritating fluid coming in contact with the ulcer would
prevent its healing.The treatment of that variety of ulceration where
the disease is situated partly without the anus and partly within the
rectum, besides the use of the means enumerated above, embraces the
daily introduction of a full-sized bougie made of wax or of yellow
soap.Henry Hartshorne says: "Experience leads me to have especial
confidence in collodion, to which one-fiftieth of glycerin has been
added to lessen its constricting effect."Glycerite of tannin and
tinct.J. C. Peters[39] recommends the
use of iodoform suppositories.Tarnier[40] dusts the part with the same
drug in fine powder.Crequy[41] has had success with a dressing of
charpie saturated in a solution of hydrate of chloral.For the more
extensive and obstinate forms of ulceration the three methods of
treatment mainly relied on are--by cauterization, by dilatation, and by
incision.The caustics usually relied upon are the fuming nitric acid
and the acid nitrate of mercury, one application of either of these
often exciting healthy granulation.This application is to be followed
by the use of an ointment consisting of thirty grains of calomel and
three grains of morphia to one ounce of lard.If there is much spasm of
the sphincters, extract of belladonna may be added.[42] During this
treatment the bowels should be kept rather loose by the use of compound
licorice powder, and if much pain is experienced an opium suppository
should be used.Dilatation, first practised by Recamier, consists of
the introduction of the thumbs of the operator into the rectum, placing
them back to back, and then forcibly separating them from each other
until the sides of the bowel can be stretched out as far as the
tuberosities of the ischia.On account of the fact that both
cauterization and dilatation are not infrequently followed by relapse,
the method of operation which includes both incision and dilatation can
usually be relied {913} upon.The bowels should be thoroughly emptied
by a laxative, and an enema should be given three hours before the
operation.[Footnote 41: Ashton, _On the Rectum_, p.[Footnote 42: Agnew's _Surgery_, vol.After full anaesthesia the ulcer may be readily exposed.The left index
finger of the operator is then carried into the rectum, and a
sharp-pointed curved bistoury is entered, three-quarters of an inch or
more from the side of the anus, to the depth of an inch or less, and
carried on toward the bowel until the point is felt by the finger
within, when it is made to puncture the mucous membrane, and then to
cut out to the surface.In some cases of deep fissure, before dividing
the sphincter the ulcer may be scraped freely or the entire ulcer may
be removed.The anus should now be well dilated with the fingers, after
which an opium suppository should be introduced and a fragment of lint
or linen well oiled be placed in the wound.The subsequent treatment
consists in keeping the patient in a recumbent position and confining
the bowels with opium.After three or four days a laxative may be
given.No dressing is necessary save attention to cleanliness.The subcutaneous division of the sphincter has been proposed, but is
objected to on account of the liability of the extravasated blood
retained in the very loose cellular tissue of the part to form abscess.In one case which Morton operated upon in this manner many years ago a
large abscess formed very rapidly, with serious constitutional
symptoms, which were relieved only after the freest opening and
division of the sphincter.Should any polypi be found, their removal by ligation or by the knife
is an essential element of success in the operation; retention of urine
is not infrequent after operations upon fissure.When fissure or
ulceration makes its appearance in a syphilitic subject, it will
usually disappear under appropriate constitutional treatment.TUBERCULOUS ULCER OF THE ANUS is best treated by the topical use of a
weak solution of chloral hydrate.CHRONIC ULCER OF THE RECTUM.--In this condition the treatment should
include the use of anodyne and astringent lotions, suppositories or
enemata, and the internal administration of Ward's paste--_i.e._
confection of black pepper.RODENT ULCER OF RECTUM.--In this rather rare, exceeding painful, and
generally incurable malady the patient sometimes dies merely from the
exhaustion of pain.Another mode of death is by diarrhoea; another by
hemorrhage.To quote Allingham:[43] "I have really nothing to offer as
regards treatment; all the various sedatives will be required in their
turn, and in the earlier stage I should recommend excision--not that I
have much hope that you will eradicate the malady, but you will remove
the pain, and for some time the sufferer will be comparatively
comfortable.I think also the application of fuming nitric acid should
be tried with the same object; one of my patients was fairly easy for
three months after I had destroyed the ulcer with the acid."Morton
accomplished the permanent healing of an undoubted rodent ulcer of the
rectum by the complete divulsion of all the involved tissues.CANCER OF THE RECTUM.--The medical treatment of this affection is
necessarily restricted to efforts to alleviate suffering and to obtain
sleep--anodynes in the form of suppositories of pil.hyoscyamus in the proportion of a half
grain of the {914} salt to ten grains of the extract.Enemata of warm
water are useful.D'Arpene of Elba has suggested enemata of gastric
juice.The profuse discharge of sanious pus must be met by weak
injection of sulphate of copper and opium or a very dilute solution of
chloride of zinc.Now, as to the use of bougies in these cases, it may
be laid down as a general rule that their employment may be
mischievous, yet in certain cases justifiable--indeed, absolutely
necessary.When the disease is met with in its early stage, has not
ulcerated, is within reach of the finger, and is producing much
contraction of the calibre of the gut, a gum-elastic bougie, thoroughly
lubricated, may be introduced through the contraction.In case this
produces much suffering, the attempt must be abandoned; if not, once or
twice a week is often enough.Where no extensive ulceration exists the
patient can be much helped by this procedure.F. N. Otis[44] has
reported a case of malignant stricture in which he completely divided
the recto-vaginal septum, sphincter ani, and perineum with great
temporary relief to his patient.When large portions of a malignant
mass protrude from the anus, they may be removed by the application of
a paste of arsenite of copper or by the elastic ligature, the
destruction being safe and rapid.The injection of acetic acid into
these growths has been practised, but is useless and harmful.As to operative procedure, when the morbid growth is an epithelioma
situated within a short distance of the anal opening an excision is not
only justifiable, but may be recommended.The results show that its
removal from this situation is as frequently successful as is its
removal from the lip.When a cancer completely fills the lumen of the
gut and plugs it so that the act of defecation becomes impossible,
excision of the rectum and the establishment of an artificial anus are
the two operative procedures open to the choice of the surgeon.A
decided reaction of opinion has lately taken place among members of the
profession relative to the latter of these; the few surgeons who did
practise excision of the rectum in cases of cancer were looked upon as
being rather unscientific and unsurgical.Billroth has excised the
rectum 16 times, with 4 fatal cases; Dieffenbach performed it 30 times;
Lisfranc had recourse to this operation as early as 1826; while the
operation has been performed very frequently in this country, and with
success.Morton says: "In the spring of 1882, I was consulted in the case of a
lady aged fifty-six who had suffered for two years from what were
supposed to be internal hemorrhoids.An examination revealed the
existence of a large scirrhous mass encircling about two-thirds of the
gut, on the anterior part especially, and extending upward three
inches.The patient was worn down by long suffering, but was otherwise
in fair condition of health.With the assistance of Gross and Agnew, I
excised the mass, which included the entire lower part of the rectum.The wound healed kindly, without an untoward symptom, and the patient
was very soon enabled to leave her home for the seaside, where she
passed the summer.The disease, however, resumed, but without any of
the severe pains which she had had prior to the operation.Death
occurred from gradual exhaustion seven months afterward."He also relates the following case of excision of the rectum: The
patient, a female aged thirty-five years, first noticed some rectal
{915} irritation about four years ago.This was followed by distressing
pain during defecation and by hemorrhages; finally a tumor, which was
described by her medical attendant as being like an opened umbrella,
protruded, partly at first, then fully, through the anus.The growth
seemed to be spongy in character, and was very vascular.It was removed
by carrying a double-threaded needle through the mass, and thus
ligating it.Upon the seventh day after the operation a hemorrhage
occurred, which was controlled by plugging the rectum.Although the
growth was removed, the patient did not make a good recovery; symptoms
of rectal irritation continued.In September, 1884, the patient
presented herself in a wretched condition, with bearing-down pains and
frequent hemorrhages.Upon digital examination an elevated mass was
readily detected upon the sacral aspect of the bowel.By carrying the
fingers beyond this mass and making traction, it was brought down
within working distance, and was excised along with the entire lower
portion of the rectum.The freshly-cut edges of the gut were then drawn
down and stitched to the mucous membrane just above the anus.The
patient made a good recovery and has a serviceable anus.R. J. Levis[45] has operated upon two cases of cancerous growth in the
rectum, removing the lower part of the bowel.The first case was that
of a man aged sixty, who made a very good recovery from the successful
operation, although three inches of the gut were removed.The second
case was that of a man aged fifty-two, who had a carcinomatous tumor
the size of a hen's egg at the right side of the rectum.The section of
gut excised was about one and a half inches in length.The patient died
of peritonitis upon the fourth day after operation.At the autopsy
there was no wound found in the peritoneum, the lowest point of which
was one inch above the end of the excised bowel.[Footnote 45: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, pp.The etherized patient, his bladder having been emptied, should be
placed in the lithotomy position.If a male, a sound should be passed
into the bladder.An incision is then carried from the centre of the
perineum along the raphe to the anterior margin of the anus, encircling
the latter by two semicircular cuts and continuing the division
directly back to the coccyx.In the female the incision should begin
just posterior to the vagina.If the anus is not included in the
diseased mass, the external sphincter may be spared by raising the skin
and the muscle together and turning them on each side.When the lower
end of the rectum is reached the dissection should be made entirely by
the fingers or by the handle of the knife, tying vessels as they
spring.Double ligatures should be introduced through the gut from its
mucous surface outward, and, when possible, then stitched to the skin
at the margins of the wound.The bowels should be controlled by opium
for the following eight or ten days.The other operative procedure is lumbar colotomy.This was first
advocated by Amussat in 1839, when he appeared in a treatise upon the
subject entitled _On the Possibility of Establishing an Artificial Anus
in the Lumbar Region_.It is denied that he ever performed this
operation.It has happened to sound surgeons and skilful operators,
when the patient has been very muscular or very fat or when the colon
has been collapsed, that they have been at length compelled to abandon
the search for the gut {916} and to stitch up the external wound.Allingham states that the cause of failure often is that the colon is
searched for too far from the spine, resulting, in the opening of the
peritoneum, in the starting up into the wound of a mass of small
intestine which baffles the operator very seriously.He, having made
more than fifty dissections, has come to this conclusion: "that the
descending colon is always normally situated half an inch posterior to
the centre of the crest of the ileum (the centre being the point midway
between the anterior, superior, and posterior-superior spinous
processes)."An incision four inches in length should be made midway
between the last rib and the crest of the ileum.The incision may be
made transverse, or, better, obliquely downward and forward, as
suggested by Bryant.Allingham says that care should be taken to
preserve the original length of the incision down through all
structures, lest when the operator approaches the gut he finds himself
working in the apex of a triangle the base of which is the line of the
wound.If the surgeon has reason to expect the gut to be collapsed, an
attempt should be made to distend it with some fluid.The intestine
should be drawn well out through the wound, and a longitudinal opening
an inch in length made in it.The edges of this are to be stitched to
the edges of the skin.Fecal matter is much less likely to flow into
the wound if the sutures are passed through the intestine previous to
opening it.A weak carbolated wash is all that is required as a
dressing.In one case of stricture of the rectum from a scirrhous mass,
in which Morton performed colotomy, an immense cyst of the kidney,
which was somewhat puzzling for a moment, protruded in the wound.After
emptying the cyst the gut was readily discovered and opened.DILATATION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE RECTAL POUCHES.--This is a
comparatively rare condition of the rectum, called by Physick encysted
rectum, which is treated by bending the end of a probe into a hook,
passing it up into the bowel, and then withdrawing it with its
extremity resting against the surface, so as to engage and draw down
the pouches, the straining or bearing down of the patient assisting in
their extrusion; they may then be incised or cut off with a pair of
curved scissors.LOSS OF CO-ORDINATION IN THE MUSCLES OF DEFECATION.--In those cases
where it can be ascertained that this curious trouble is not
symptomatic, sympathetic, nor reflex, the treatment must be directed to
the building up of the general health, such as electricity, baths,
asafoetida, and iron.SPHINCTERISMUS.--This condition, though frequently attendant upon, may
exist in the absence of, any fissure, crack, or ulcer of the anus.In its treatment magnesia and
rhubarb are to be used, and the diet must be simple, unstimulating, and
taken at regular intervals.A hot hip-bath at night, with the use of a
belladonna suppository, often proves effective.In more obstinate cases
a bougie covered with ointment of belladonna should be used daily.In
still more intractable cases the muscle must be forcibly stretched with
the fingers.In the more obstinate cases which now and then occur it
becomes necessary to completely divide the fibres of the sphincter
muscle, followed by a thorough stretching of the parts.{917} PRURITUS ANI.--This distressing and vexatious complaint proceeds
frequently from hemorrhoids.When caused by the presence of seat-worms,
they must be dislodged by purgatives and enemata of quassia or of one
composed of one part of carbolic acid to six parts of sweet oil, or of
turpentine and flaxseed tea.An enema of milk of asafoetida answers a
good purpose.If the pruritus is a result of the burrowing of the itch
insect, any wash, ointment, or dressing that evolves sulphuretted
hydrogen will rapidly bring relief.If caused by other parasites, an
application of ung.or red precipitate ointment, followed by a
warm bath, will be all that is necessary.In some it is a symptom of
dyspepsia, in others of a disordered state of the nerves of the anus
independent of local cause: in this case iron, quinia, and arsenic
should be given, and the patient should live an outdoor life as much as
possible.The remedies that have in turn been extolled and abandoned
during the treatment of this distressing condition it would require too
much space to even mention.The following are among the best: Sulphate
of zinc and alum, equal parts, are to be placed in an earthen vessel
and heated until a glassy mass is left, which is to be dissolved in a
little water and thrown into the bowel; palm soap pressed into the
anus, ointments of carbolic acid and morphia or of bromide of potassium
and cosmoline, citrine and other mercurial ointments, and suppositories
containing iodoform.Allingham uses a bone or a metallic plug of
peculiar construction, so as to keep the anus upon the stretch at night
without slipping into the bowel.The pressure which this exerts upon
the nerves and vessels prevents the itching.Hot (not warm) water
pressed against the anus with a sponge, or ten-drop doses internally of
tincture of gelsemium, or washes of dilute hydrocyanic acid or of
chloroform, or ointments of balsam of Peru or of veratria and aconitia,
or the corrosive chloride of mercury in solution applied locally, are a
few of the more reliable among this host.STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM (NON-MALIGNANT).--The main modes of treatment
of non-malignant stricture of the rectum are two--by dilatation or by
linear incision (rectotomy).Dilatation may be practised by the finger
alone or by the finger covered with hollow rubber covers of various
sizes.These are open at the end, so that the guiding and recognizing
sense of touch may be left to the end of the finger.When the stricture
is out of reach of this method, either gum or metallic bougies must be
used, beginning with the smaller sizes and deliberately and carefully
adding sizes.When the lumen of a stricture is tortuous it is best to
use a long rather flexible rubber bougie having an olive-shaped
extremity.It is not necessary to leave these bougies standing for
hours in a stricture, according to the practice of some; this merely
excites inflammation.Should the stricture be irritable, every second
or third day would be sufficiently often to attempt dilatation.In
constrictions which are firm, but not sensitive, a good plan is to
insert a Molesworth elastic tube and gradually distend it by
hydrostatic pressure; Barnes's dilators have also been successfully
used.When the stricture is elastic and re-forms itself at once after
dilatation, incision should be practised.In those strictures which are
low down, the constriction may be nicked in several places by a hernia
knife, the blade of which is guided along a finger in the bowel; when
high up, a long double-bladed knife must be employed.In syphilitic
strictures, in addition to dilatation, proper alterative treatment is
{918} indispensable.As dilatation has often to be kept up for a long
time, the patient may be taught to practise this for himself.PERI-ANAL AND PERI-RECTAL ABSCESS.--When acute, and when the surgeon is
called in time, the prompt application of leeches may abort the
abscess, but usually, by the time the surgeon sees it, it is necessary
to apply hot flaxseed poultices as fast as they become cool, keeping
the patient in bed upon light diet.The rule is to open deeply and
freely so soon as the least softening under the poultices indicates
that pus is within reach.After lancing, the poultices should be
continued for a few days: then the deep wound should be packed with a
strip of oiled lint and allowed to granulate from the bottom.As the
fetor of these abscesses is horrible, they should be injected with a
solution of permanganate of potash or liq.When the
chronic variety of this abscess is discovered, it, with all its
sinuses, diverticula, and pockets, should be laid freely open upon a
director and packed with carbolized lint.It is often very necessary in
these chronic cases to use tonic and alterative treatment, such as
cod-liver oil and iodide of iron.GONORRHOEA OF THE RECTUM.--Undoubted cases of gonorrhoea of the rectum
in the persons of prostitutes have been observed.Burning heat and
great pain are usually felt, with a free discharge of pure pus: the
mucous membrane is always intensely inflamed.The treatment is simple;
an injection of lead-water and laudanum or of sulphate of zinc answers
a good purpose.Primary syphilitic disease of the anus and rectum is
rarely seen, but of course the treatment indicated would be similar to
that laid down for primary syphilis in its usual localities.IMPACTION OF FECES.--This condition usually occurs among the aged and
in women after parturition and in cases of paralysis.Those persons of
sedentary habits who do not pay sufficient attention to the necessity
of a daily alvine evacuation sometimes find themselves in this
condition.Impaction occurs not infrequently among the insane, and more
frequently among women than men.Allingham states that he has never
seen a case of impaction in a young person; but Wetherill now has under
his care a most obstinate case of this disorder in a young man whose
system has been completely broken down by intemperance in drink.In paralysis of the rectum of traumatic origin impaction is almost
certain to take place unless great care is taken to prevent it.Diarrhoea is a very misleading element in these cases, and is a symptom
which frequently deceives those who are not on their guard.The clayey
mass of feculent matter forms a hard ball in the distended bowel,
around which the small loose passages flow.Spasm of the sphincter ani
is the usual accompaniment of impaction, and the muscle should be
gently but thoroughly dilated before means can be used to free the
canal.The finger or the handle of a tablespoon is best to use in the
dislodgment of these masses, and should be oiled before introduction,
the accumulation broken up, and then washed out by an enema of soap,
turpentine, and warm water.Purgatives and hydragogue cathartics
usually fail to give relief, and add much to the patient's discomfort.The bowel once freed, care must be taken to prevent a reaccumulation,
which very readily takes place, as the bowel in these cases is
distended and has lost tone.To this end frequent enemata of cold water
should be used, and the patient should {919} take a pill of dried
sulphate of iron, sulphate of quinia, extract of nux vomica, extract of
aloes, as recommended by Allingham.An
excellent adjunct to this treatment is the local use of the faradic
galvanic current daily after breakfast.Let the patient lie upon a bed
and apply one pole or electrode to the anus, while the other one is
passed with pressure along the course of the large intestine.Not
infrequently it happens after this has been continued for a few minutes
that a very urgent desire is felt to go to stool.In the case mentioned
of the young man affected with impaction this treatment answered
admirably well, but before its use he had to take a small dose of
croton oil daily to cause an action of the bowels, all milder measures
having proved ineffectual.It is important in these cases to interdict
a sedentary mode of life.IRRITABLE RECTUM.--A rectum is said to be irritable when it shows an
intolerance of the presence of feces or flatus, causing frequent desire
to go to stool.From such abnormal activity of the part there arise a
burning, uncomfortable impression of fulness and a soreness of the
anus.If after examination it is found that there is no local exciting
cause, a starch enema containing forty drops of laudanum should be
given and retained.Should the irritability prove to be obstinate, examine the rectum, and
if a spot of redness or increased vascularity be found, touch the spot
with strong nitric acid.CONCRETIONS IN THE RECTUM.--These occur less frequently than do
impactions, and differ from them in being cylindrical and nucleated,
the nuclei being such bodies as balls or tangled masses of hair, or
coins, buttons, biliary calculi, or the like.Covering these are matted
animal or vegetable fibres or hardened fecal matter.They are not so
readily dislodged as are impactions, and it is necessary to dilate the
sphincter thoroughly and remove them with a scoop.Not infrequently
these bodies are bathed in pus and are very fetid.PROCTITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE RECTUM.--This may be either acute or
chronic, the latter being a disease of the aged.Allingham recommends
in this variety small doses of Barbadoes aloes to stimulate the bowel,
also such drugs as copaiba, turpentine, and black pepper.As an
injection in the acute form starch and laudanum, or bismuth suspended
in a mucilaginous vehicle, should be used.Probably the use of small,
smooth fragments of ice in the rectum would allay the tenesmus and help
to subdue the inflammation.PROLAPSUS ANI AND PROCIDENTIA.--Prolapsus occurs much more frequently
in children than in adults, making its appearance at every movement of
the bowels.The child thus affected should not be allowed to sit upon
the chamber-vessel and strain, but should lie upon the side or stand,
while the nurse should be instructed to draw to one side one of the
buttocks so as to tighten the anal orifice.After the motion the
protruded part should be well washed in cold water, and afterward with
some astringent solution of oak-bark, matico, or a weak solution of
carbolic acid applied with a soft sponge.The bowel should then be
gently returned and the child be allowed to lie at rest for a while.If
there exists intestinal irritation, small doses of mercury with chalk,
with rhubarb at night, with wine of iron three times daily, would be
indicated.{920} The application of an anal pad and a T-bandage will
give sufficient support.If this treatment be carried out a cure
usually results in a few weeks.Some cases do not yield to this mode,
and then the surgeon has to make trial of ergotin given hypodermically,
each injection representing a grain of ergot, which is to be thrown
into the submucous tissue of the rectum every second day for two weeks.Should relief not follow its use, cauterization is to be tried.The
cauterants usually applied are nitrate of silver, acid nitrate of
mercury, and nitric acid.Of these, nitric acid is the best.After
anaesthesia is complete every portion of the extrusion should be
touched with the acid, care being taken not to bring it into contact
with the skin; afterward the bowel is to be freely oiled and returned.To prevent its extrusion the bowel should be filled with soft cotton
wool, a compress placed over the anus, and the buttocks strapped
tightly together with adhesive plaster.For a general quieting effect
the child should be given paregoric.About the fourth day the adhesive
plaster may be removed and a dose of castor oil administered, which
will bring away the cotton plug with the dejection.Prolapsus and procidentia in the adult are much less manageable;
indeed, these conditions are usually very obstinate.There may exist
causes extraneous to the bowel, such as urethral stricture or enlarged
prostate or an impacted renal calculus or a calculus of the prostate.The bowel should be searched for polypi or hemorrhoids, and the
prolapse may be cured by the removal of the irritating cause.Failing
to find any such cause, the surgeon has at his command either
cauterization or a removal of redundancy.The former may be by nitrate
of silver or acid nitrate of mercury or the actual cautery.It is well
not to apply these strong acids to the aged or those who are broken
down in health, as very destructive sloughing has followed their use in
these cases.When these are used, the same plan as that mentioned in
case of prolapse in children should be pursued.Strong carbolic acid
may be used in these cases with much less risk of sloughing than when
the acid is employed, and it may be applied oftener--indeed, daily if
desirable.Van Buren has recommended linear cauterization with the hot
iron to the mucous membrane, the bowel contracting as a result of
cicatrization.In adults generally, and especially in the aged, all the
forms of cauterization are less satisfactory as a means of relief than
either of the various modifications of Copeland's operation, which
consists in removing by ligation elliptical portions of the mucous and
submucous tissues of the prolapsed bowel.The most satisfactory of
these is either to excise two or three oval portions of the mucous
membrane with flat-curved scissors and bring the edges together with
interrupted suture, or to pinch up in several places the redundancy in
a Smith's clamp and cut off the folds in advance of the instrument,
applying to the stumps the hot iron.Allingham prefers ligatures of
horsehair in these operations, and mentions the carbolized catgut in
preference to silk.He cautions the operator not to carry his knife
into the submucous tissue, as free hemorrhage would inevitably occur.In old cases of prolapsus or of procidentia that are not amenable to
operative treatment much can be done to render them comfortable: the
air-dilated gum pessary will sometimes afford relief, or a pad and
T-bandage will prevent the parts becoming ulcerated by friction.Neither gallic {921} nor tannic acid answers the purpose so well as
acorn flour.The frequent use of cold water to the part is always
attended with comfort, and sometimes with relief.In these old cases of
great relaxation Nelaton has used strychnia by the mouth, and Weber (of
New York) hypodermically, with fair result.Vidal has cured three cases
by the repeated use of ergotin locally, hypodermically.In order to
bring about a radical cure in these very chronic cases, very decided
means sometimes are justifiable.Hey of Leeds was the
first to propose a plan by which, through cicatricial contraction and
inflammatory gluing together of the various tissues composing the
bowel, the anus and sphincter muscle might be strengthened and improved
in tone; to which end he proposed to cut away the pendulous flaps of
skin around the anus.In cases where these flaps are very redundant a
cure is sometimes effected by this procedure alone.Other cases will be
benefited by the operation proposed by Dupuytren, which consists in the
removal of radiating folds of the skin and mucous membrane at the edge
of the anus.To quote from Holmes's _System of Surgery_: "This
operation is effected by laying hold of the fold of skin on each side
of the anus with forceps, then with a sharp curved pair of scissors
removing both skin and mucous membrane.In very severe cases four or
six applications of the scissors may be necessary."POLYPUS OF THE RECTUM.--The polypi of the rectum are the gelatinoid and
the fibroid, but as a very rare occurrence a villous or warty polypus
has been found.Polypoid growths are very different bodies, but they
are too frequently confounded with true polypi.The only treatment is
their removal, and the safest method is by ligation of the pedicle, and
either cutting off the growth in advance of the knot or returning it
into the bowel.The patient should remain quiet until the sloughing is
complete, and his bowels must be confined, otherwise profuse and very
troublesome hemorrhage might ensue.Their removal by the clamp and
cautery is equally safe.Their removal by torsion or by the scissors is
unsafe.The peculiar villous polypus causes great and exhausting hemorrhage.A
case was successfully treated by the application of fuming nitric acid.FISTULA IN ANO.--In the palliative treatment of this very common malady
no great amount of relief can be afforded.Those who are aged and
feeble or those who are much broken down will find comfort to attend
the free local use of warm water, and the sinuses should be injected
with dilute solutions of one of the mineral astringents, the strength
of these not exceeding two grains to the fluidounce of water.Cosmoline, simple cerate, ointment of the oxide of zinc, and even fresh
lard, make the patient easier, as they prevent friction of the
buttocks.One of the forms of the radical treatment consists in the
division of all the structures between the fistulous tract and the
surface.This may be accomplished either by the use of the knife or by
seton.Stimulating injections or cauterization has been known
occasionally to permanently close fistulae in ano; but such plans of
treatment are unreliable, and usually unjustifiable.When the fistula
is not so high up in the bowel as to render the use of the knife
unsafe, this plan of treatment should be adopted.As an invariable
preliminary to all operations upon the rectum the bowels should be
thoroughly emptied and the patient should be placed under the influence
of {922} an anaesthetic.A flexible grooved director should then be
carried through the opening of the tract upon the surface and along the
tract to its opening in the bowel, should such exist.The forefinger
within the rectum will meet the point of the director as it emerges
from the internal opening, and the director should be pushed onward and
its extremity guided outward until it rests fairly upon the sound
integument outside, and all the included structures should be divided
along the groove of the director with a sharp-pointed curved bistoury.Should the fore finger in the rectum not discover an internal opening,
one should be forced at the very bottom of the tract by rotating the
point of the director while making counter-pressure with the end of the
finger.Should several fistulae be found, they should be treated in
like manner.Sometimes it will be found that the incision is overlapped
by the dusky-red flaps composing its margins, in which case they should
be trimmed off with scissors.When the tract extends deeper than its
internal opening, the latter should be ignored and the sinus laid open
to its very bottom.When no external opening exists, one should be
made, and the guide for this incision will be a point of induration
felt by the finger at some point not far from the surface.The director
entering at this point will find the tract, and should be pushed
forward as described above.These opened sinuses should be packed with
lint soaked in carbolized oil and confined by a pad and a T-bandage.It
is the practice at the Pennsylvania Hospital to apply after division a
stick of caustic potassa, allowing it to remain in contact with the cut
surfaces for several seconds, after which the wounds are to be packed.The bowels should
be confined for a few days, after which a dose of oil may be given.Besides attention to cleanliness and a daily renewing of the packing no
further treatment will be demanded.The hemorrhage attending these
operations is usually trifling.Should a vessel spring, a ligature may
be thrown around it.When an abundant general oozing occurs, the rectum
must be packed and a compress and bandage firmly applied.Should the
surgeon prefer the seton operation, he should carry several threads of
stout silk or a piece of rubber cord on an eyed probe into the fistula
and out of its internal opening, and by tying their ends firmly down
upon the enclosed tissues slowly effect the same result as in the
cutting operation.When the seton used is silk, the ends should be
carried through holes in a round leaden plate or through those of an
ordinary button, and tied.These setons are to be drawn tighter every
three or four days until the division of the enclosed tissues is
complete.The subsequent treatment is the same as in the other
operation.A difference of opinion exists among surgeons as to the propriety of
operating for fistula in ano in persons afflicted with tubercular
disease of the lungs.The practice of the present day is decidedly in
favor of operating, without reference to the condition of the lungs,
provided the patient is not too much reduced in strength.An operation for fistula in ano has been proposed and practised by
Reeves, which is a compromise between cutting and ligation.He says:
"It consisted in passing a strong and well-waxed silk ligature along
the track of the fistula into the bowel.An ordinary surgical probe
with an eye in its end carried this thread into the rectum.My bivalve
expanding speculum was previously introduced, and by its use there was
no difficulty {923} in seeing and seizing the ligature and bringing it
out through the anus.The probe was then withdrawn, and the ends of the
silk were wound round two strong pieces of wood which were held between
the fingers of each hand.An assistant passed a finger on either side
of the track of the fistula to steady the tissues and to resist the
traction which was put on the silk thread.The two pieces of wood were
then drawn toward me with a rapid sawing motion, and the fistula was
quickly divided, with the loss of scarcely any blood.Some oiled lint
and a pad and bandage were applied in the usual way; and the wound
healed well.No anaesthetic was administered, and although the patient
did not relish the operation, still it was quite bearable, and what she
felt most was a burning sensation, due, doubtless, to the friction of
the silk."HEMORRHOIDS.--The treatment of this form of rectal and anal disease is
either medical or surgical according to the gravity of the case and
according to the obstinacy with which it resists local and general
therapeutic agents.An ordinary acute attack of external piles, such as
is often produced by neglect of the bowels, causing constipation, may
be treated in the following manner: The patient should rest and avoid
stimulating food and beverages.He should employ cold bathing to the
part frequently: indeed, great comfort and relief often follow this
treatment alone.An ointment of tannic acid, glycerin, and simple
cerate, or one containing calomel and extract of opium, will be found
useful.Fresh lard, cosmoline, vaseline, cold cream, ointment of the
oxide of zinc (benzoated) or an ointment containing extract of opium,
extract of galls, and extract of belladonna or stramonium, are some
among many agents that have been extolled for their relief.H. C.
Wood[46] recommends enemata of solution of chlorate of potassium and
laudanum.Enemata of lime-water and linseed oil are recommended by
Agnew: "One of the very best formulas for allaying the irritation
incident to hemorrhoidal affections consists of the following
combination: Acetate of lead and tannin, of each fifteen grains;
carbonate of lead and extract of stramonium, of each thirty grains;
creasote, five drops.With a sufficient quantity of cocoa-butter mould
this into fifty suppositories."[47] The internal exhibition of the
balsam of copaiba, twenty drops in capsules taken four or five times
daily, or the use of fifteen drops of liquor potassa rubbed up with
half a drachm of the balsam into emulsion, taken three times a day, has
been much extolled, as has also the confection of black pepper.Sometimes these various means will cure a chronic or long-standing case
of piles, either internal or external.Wetherill has found that the
topical application of rectified oil of amber has cured long-standing
cases of piles.This oil should not be applied in cases where much
inflammation exists, and where the piles are internal the best mode of
bringing it in contact with them is to incorporate from three to five
minims of the oil with sufficient cocoa-butter to make a suppository.One of these, pushed into the bowel night and morning for a week, will
not infrequently cause the piles to shrink up and finally to disappear.The bowels should be kept open with the compound powder of licorice.It
should be remembered that magnesia irritates hemorrhoids.Success has
followed the internal use of ergotin, of the fluid extract of hamamelis
virginica, of the corn blast (ustilago maidis), and of small doses of
aloes combined with hyoscyamus.{924} D. Young has had good results
follow the internal use of glycerin.Chronic cases of piles have been
cured by the application of ointments containing carbonate of lead,
creasote, carbolic acid, or iodoform.Ergotin used hypodermically in
the vicinity of the anus or injected into the piles has frequently
resulted in a complete cure, and the same may be said of the injection
of carbolic acid directly into the tumors.In the application of cold
water to inflamed piles it should be borne in mind that its forcible
impingement upon them in a fine stream acts far more efficiently than
the mere bathing them.Some cases do better under the use of warm water
or warm sedative and astringent lotions.A warm flaxseed poultice mixed
with laudanum is a very comfortable application.In obstinate cases of
prolapse Agnew[48] recommends the use of a rectal obturator or the use
of a hemorrhoidal truss.[Footnote 47: _Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital_, p.[Footnote 48: Agnew's _Surgery_, vol.Those who suffer from prolapse of piles should avoid the habitual use
of cushioned seats.They should assume a semi-erect posture during
defecation, or, when this is attended with difficulty or inconvenience,
they should contrive a portable water-closet seat by boring a hole an
inch and a half in diameter through a piece of planed board, bevelling
it so as to fit the person.These means will often prevent the
extrusion of the tumors.After defecation the patient should rest for a
little while in the recumbent attitude.The careful touching of external piles with strong nitric acid is a
mode of treatment that has been quite successful in the hands of some
surgeons.The intolerable itching of these bodies can be allayed by
touching them with tincture of aconite-root or with a concentrated
tincture of prickly-ash bark.Freezing them with the ether spray allays
the pain and itching for the time being, but these symptoms return with
redoubled energy after the effect has subsided.Should an attack of the external variety of piles not result in
absorption, but leave an excrescence, painless but inconvenient, and
liable at any time to become inflamed, excision would be in order.Divide the integument by an incision radiating from the anus, separate
the skin from the tumor down to its base, and after seizing it with
toothed forceps cut it off with scissors curved on the flat.Little
flaps or tabs of skin remaining after piles may be snipped off with
scissors.It is not well to operate upon external piles unless they
obstinately resist all milder treatment.There are frequently venous
enlargements containing blood-clot, and when this condition exists
proceed as follows: Pinch up the little tumor between the thumb and
finger of the left hand; transfix its base with a curved bistoury, and
cut out; at the same time, by pressure with the thumb and finger,
extrude the clot.Fill the bottom of the little sac with cotton wool,
and the operation is complete.It is not necessary in these cases to
wait until the inflammation subsides before operating.The operative treatment of the internal variety may be by
strangulation, by the cautery, by the ecraseur, and by the use of
caustics.The former of these is the safest and most convenient method,
and the one usually employed in the Pennsylvania Hospital, and should
be performed in the following manner: The lower bowel having been
thoroughly evacuated and the patient etherized, the operator should
gently but firmly stretch the sphincter.The patient should be placed
upon the side, with {925} the upper part of the body prone, the hips
elevated, and the thighs flexed upon the abdomen.Transfix the largest
tumor with a strong, long-handled tenaculum, cut through the skin at
the base with a knife or scissors around its external half, and hand
the hook to an assistant, instructing him to make gentle traction.Then
encircle the mass with a stout cord if the mass is not too large, or
pass a stout needle threaded with a double silk ligature, from without
inward, deeply through the base of the pile, drawing it through the
mucous membrane on the opposite side; cut loose the needle and tie
tightly, so as to completely strangulate the included tissues on either
side and leave the ends of the ligature long.Treat all the remaining
tumors in a similar manner seriatim, and then with scissors cut away
the strangulated bodies to within a safe distance of the ligatures, the
ends of which are now to be cut off close.Place an opium suppository
in the bowel, and the operation is complete.When for any sufficiently good reason the patient will not bear the
ordinary anaesthetics, it will become necessary to modify the operation
as follows: The tumors having been well extruded by enema of warm water
or by the efforts of the patient, bend him forward over a chair and
direct an assistant to draw aside the buttocks.Then pass the double
ligatures as before indicated, but refrain from tying until all the
tumors are thus secured, as the operator will find it convenient to
draw upon the ligatures to keep the mass of piles within view and
working-distance.Then draw down each tumor, cut around its base, and
tie as before; cut off the ends of the ligatures and the greater
portion of each strangulated tumor, and return everything within the
bowel, and follow with an opium suppository.In many cases Morton has
used the nitrous oxide gas with the best results.The hook should then
be withdrawn, and each knot should be drawn more firmly down prior to
its reduplication.Following this procedure, if properly carried out,
the tumors will change color, becoming blue, thus indicating complete
strangulation.The operation by the clamp and cautery is a good method when the
hemorrhoidal tumors are small.Cusack of
Dublin, and the clamp employed is that invented by Mr.This instrument is so well known that a detailed description of
it would be unnecessary.In operating with it the tumor is to be drawn
well out and the clamp applied close up to its attachment with the
bowel.Strangulation is effected by means of the screw which runs
through the shafts of the handles.This accomplished, the strangulated
portion is cut off with scissors, which should leave a stump
three-eighths of an inch long.To this stump apply the actual cautery
at a dull red heat, touching its every portion, after which unscrew and
remove the clamp and look for hemorrhage.Should any occur, touch the
bleeding point with the hot iron.Confine the patient to bed for five
or six days and give sufficient opium to confine the bowels.After this
time has elapsed administer a dose of oil.Remember that but one pile
should be clamped at one time."The taking two piles into the clamp at
once is sure to result in hemorrhage."Do not allow the cautery-iron to
touch the clamp.After the operation return the parts within the
sphincter and cut off any tabs of redundant integument with scissors.The removal of internal piles by means of the ecraseur was the favorite
operation of Chassaignac, but it is a mode of procedure which is now
{926} regarded with disfavor by the best surgeons on account of the
liability to hemorrhage, and from the fact that troublesome and
injurious contractions of the anus have not infrequently followed its
use.The employment of iron or copper wire instead of the usual chain
has been recommended by those who prefer this mode of operation.The
plan adopted by Chassaignac was to pedunculate the piles by tying a
ligature around the base and drawing them down.The chain being then
applied, the strangulation and crushing off was slowly accomplished by
means of the lever of the instrument.It should take from twenty to
twenty-five minutes' crushing to accomplish this object.For the treatment of internal piles by caustics Houston of Dublin used
strong nitric acid.A fenestrated speculum should be employed, and the
acid should be applied with a piece of wood or with a glass brush, care
being taken to limit its action to the tumors, the redundant liquid
being mopped up with a swab of lint or prepared absorbent cotton.The
entire surface should afterward be bathed in oil.The acid is relied
upon to produce a granulating surface, by the healing of which and by
the subsequent contraction a cure is sometimes achieved.At best, this
plan of treatment has proved tedious and unsatisfactory.Chloride of zinc and caustic potassa are even more unsatisfactory
agents for this purpose than the acid, as they are very violent in
local destruction and their action is very difficult to limit.The use
of caustic potassa was last revived by Amussat, but failed to find
favor from his contemporaries, and soon fell into merited disuse.Van
Buren says: "From recent experience with the thermo-cautery of
Paquelin, I am disposed to regard it as more manageable than nitric
acid, and at least equally efficient."Allingham mentions favorably the
strong carbolic acid as a substitute for the nitric as an application
to vascular and granular surfaces.The reckless method employed by the
older surgeons of cutting off internal piles with the knife or with
scissors, without any precautions against bleeding, is merely mentioned
in condemnation.Usually no serious symptoms are to be expected after
operations for hemorrhoids, but to this general rule there are
exceptions.Morton knows of two consecutive cases of tetanus after this
operation performed in a hospital in this city, and both terminated
fatally.One of the most common occurrences after the ligation of piles
is retention of urine, generally lasting for a day or two and requiring
the use of the catheter.HEMORRHAGE FROM THE RECTUM.--Bleeding from these parts is more usually
of a venous than an arterial character, but in some cases of
hemorrhoids the bleeding is either arterial or arterio-venous.The
latter occurs upon the detachment of a polypus, but not necessarily of
a polypoid growth.Arterial or mixed bleeding occurs in carcinoma and
in rodent ulcer, and also from the stumps of badly-occluded piles.In
cases of vicarious menstruation from the rectum the venous blood simply
oozes from the surface of the over-congested mucous membrane.This
condition should be readily diagnosed by the physical properties of the
blood and from the history of the patient.In almost all cases of
bleeding near the anus it will be possible to pick up the vessel or the
bleeding point on a tenaculum and ligate with silk, which is the most
satisfactory method to the surgeon.The rectum has been dragged down
with volsella forceps to apply a ligature to a point high up, but in
some of these cases the acupressure pin {927} with the twisted suture
will be found more convenient.Should hemorrhage occur after the
ligation of piles which cannot be checked by ligature, such as a
general oozing, pass all the ligatures through a hole made in the
centre of a small round sponge, then tie them across a piece of stick
(thus constructing a sort of tourniquet), and twist this around.Van
Buren cites a case in which a sudden laceration of the integument and
sphincter occurred during forcible dilatation in a case of hemorrhoids
in a very broken-down subject, with very copious hemorrhage.He passed
a sponge armed with a double ligature into the bowel, and, directing an
assistant to make traction upon the threads, the bleeding was checked.Injecting ice-water and perchloride of iron into the rectum will often
check hemorrhage.Allingham prefers the persulphate of iron to any
other styptic for this purpose.Passing fragments of ice into the bowel
while holding a lump of ice upon the sacrum sometimes answers a good
purpose.In many cases of secondary hemorrhage from large venous
sinuses in a state of ulceration it will be impossible to ligate, and
the use of the ordinary styptics will be but the waste of valuable
time: the bowel must be tamponed as follows: Thread a strong silk
ligature through near the apex of a cone-shaped sponge, and bring it
back again, so that the apex of the sponge is held in a loop of thread.Wet the sponge, squeeze it dry, and fill its meshes with ferric alum or
with persulphate of iron.Pass the left fore finger into the bowel, and
upon it push up the sponge, apex first, by means of a metal rod or any
other convenient body, fully five inches into the rectum.Now fill the
rectum below this with cotton-wool filled with the styptic.The bowel
having been completely filled, make traction upon the ligatures (thus
spreading out the bell-shaped sponge), while with the other hand push
up the packing.If this is carefully done no fear of bleeding need be
apprehended.In these cases the patient often suffers from collections
of flatus, which may be obviated at the time of packing by placing a
flexible catheter in the bowel and packing around it.These plugs
should remain for at least five or six days, and frequently eight or
ten days are none too long.The packing must then be picked carefully
away from the sponge.Agnew's rectal chemise answers the same purpose.In describing its application he says: "Through the openings at the end
of the largest-sized gum catheter pass a strong silk thread; take three
square pieces of the material usually known as mosquito-netting,
placing them one on top of the other; at the centre of these squares or
pieces make an opening, and pass the catheter through it, securing the
two together by the threads.In applying the instrument the different
layers of the chemise must be moistened with water, and afterward well
filled with the persulphate of iron.It is then conducted some distance
into the rectum on a finger previously inserted; after which it is
expanded like a parachute by packing between the catheter and its hood
with long strips of lint thrust up on the end of a bougie until the
bowel is distended on every side.The catheter will serve to conduct
away the flatus, and when, after eight or ten days, its removal becomes
necessary, this is very easily effected by drawing out the ribbon-like
pieces of lint which were used as packing."Another method is to stuff
the bowel with fragments of sponge to which threads are tied, the ends
of which, protruding from the anus, facilitate their withdrawal.In
conjunction with these procedures the patient's pelvis should be
elevated.{928} After excision of portions of the mucous membrane the
risk of hemorrhage will be lessened by the surgeon introducing through
the edges of each incision a few fine sutures.Enormous quantities of blood may escape into the bowel after operations
without any external symptom being apparent until the patient becomes
pallid and weak.In other cases the patient will complain of tenesmus
and desire to go to stool, or of a sensation of something trickling
into the bowel.Upon the recognition of these symptoms search should at
once be made for internal hemorrhage.Before taking leave of this very interesting class of diseases and of
their modes of treatment, it seems proper to introduce a few remarks
upon the subject of rectal alimentation, as it is now a well-recognized
and much-practised means of sustaining those whose stomachs are unequal
to the work which in health is so easily and unconsciously performed.In the use of the lower bowel as an absorbent surface of alimentary
substances many failures have been reported, a fair proportion of
which, it is safe to infer, are due to the methods employed, to the
nutritive matters employed, and to the condition of the rectum at the
time.Firstly, as to the state of the rectum, it must be empty.Wait a
reasonable time, say an hour, after stool, so that the gut may be more
passive; have the patient in the recumbent posture; direct him to
resist tenesmus and to exert both the will and the muscular power to
retain the aliment.The syringe must be of hard rubber, must be
rectal-ended, and of the capacity of two fluidounces, and perfect in
action.The preparation to be introduced, after being warmed to a temperature
of 98 degrees or 99 degrees F., should be very slowly injected with the
syringe, which should be also warmed and oiled.The enema must never
exceed in amount two fluidounces.If this be rejected, wait a
reasonable time and try again, using a less amount.If tenesmus proves
an insurmountable barrier to ordinary means, an opium suppository is to
be introduced three hours prior to another attempt.It has been
suggested, inasmuch as tenesmus is often relieved by the application of
cold to the rectum, to introduce the aliment in that state; but this
method is open to the objection that rectal digestion would be much
less likely to take place under this condition, as the bowel would then
have thrown upon it the additional work of warming up the substance
prior to absorbing it.The usual errors made in applying this means of sustaining the patient
are, that the injections are too large, are too rapidly introduced, and
are not of the proper temperature.Allowing an interval of eight hours
between the enemata would afford three in the twenty-four hours, which
method has been found to offer the best results.This must be
persevered in at regular daily intervals for the patient to derive its
full benefit, and there is reason to suppose that the nervous system
gets expectant of these daily hours of support, as it does in the case
of our ordinary meal-times.An examination of the well-formed daily
stools of patients thus sustained will prove how close the analogy is
between this and digestion proper.{929} Next, as to the substances to be employed.The best of these are
milk, eggs, concentrated beef-extracts or beef or chicken peptones, and
brandy or whiskey of good quality.These substances may be combined in
various proportions to suit the individual requirements of the case.A
very good mixture for this purpose is two tablespoonfuls of milk, one
tablespoonful of whiskey, and an egg, using both the yelk and the
albumen.This should be well beaten up and
properly warmed.It is well to persevere in the use of these enemata even though at
first most of them appear to be rejected, as after a time, the rectum
becoming accustomed to their presence, absorption or so-called rectal
digestion may take place.This form of alimentation should be kept in
reserve in a case of chronic illness until all other methods of
sustaining the patient prove insufficient to support life.It is not
contraindicated even in some cases of chronic diarrhoea with persistent
vomiting and loss of peptic function, advantage being taken of the
intervals between the evacuations to introduce a small and very
concentrated nutrient enema.In ordinary cases not complicated by
diarrhoea the most convenient times will be found to be about seven
o'clock in the morning, three in the afternoon, and eleven at night.Wetherill suggests the possibility of forming with solid extract of
beef, pepsin, and pure suet a nutrient suppository which might be
retained and absorbed in some cases in which it has been found
impossible to retain the enemata.A very small addition of white wax,
he thinks, would keep these solid during warm weather; if not, the suet
might be replaced by ol.theobroma (as in ordinary suppositories),
which is probably as likely to be absorbed as the suet.{930}

INTESTINAL WORMS.BY JOSEPH LEIDY, M.D.All animals, except in general the simple cell-forms constituting the
sub-kingdom of protozoa, under ordinary circumstances are more or less
liable to be infested with others, called parasites, which commonly
live at the expense of their hosts, frequently with little or no
inconvenience, but often causing discomfort and suffering even unto
death.Parasites are distinguished as external and internal, the two
being mostly of a widely different character.The former chiefly
pertain to the division of arthropoda, or animals with jointed limbs,
as exemplified by lice, fleas, and flies of the class of insects, mites
of the class of arachnides, and epizoans and isopods of the class of
crustaceans.Internal parasites, from their usual habitation named entozoa, are
commonly observed in the intestines of animals, and hence their
distinction as intestinal worms.The name has proved to be appropriate,
for investigations have shown that most entozoa, observed from time to
time in other parts of the bodies of animals, pass part of their life
in the intestinal canal of the same or of some other animal.By far the greater number of entozoa are peculiar animals, constituting
the chief part of the scolecides, an extensive group of the sub-kingdom
of vermes or worms.Of this group they comprise the orders of CESTODES,
or tape-worms; the ACANTHOCEPHALI, or thorn-headed worms; the
TREMATODES, or fluke-worms; and the greater portion of the NEMATODES,
or thread-worms.Many entozoa also belong to the protozoa, but these,
so far as relates to man in a medical point of view, appear
unimportant, and will therefore not here enter into consideration.In the course of their life entozoa undergo changes of form and
condition, and pass these in different organs of the same or of
different animals, and it may be for a brief period externally or in a
non-parasitic state.In many instances, as in the tape-worms and the
fluke-worms, the transformations accompanying the changes are of so
extraordinary a character that until their life-history was
investigated the successive metamorphoses were viewed as distinct
animals.Mostly, the entozoa pass one stage of existence within the
intestine of some animal, and another stage in different organs of
other animals.Many, perhaps most species, in each stage are peculiar
to one or a few nearly-related animals, but others of the same kind
infest a number of different animals.The animals infested by the same
parasite may be remotely as well as nearly related.Thus the Taenia
saginata, or beef tape-worm, in the mature state lives in the small
intestine of man {931} only, but in its juvenile or larval condition in
the flesh meat of the ox.The Taenia elliptica, the common tape-worm of
the intestine of the dog, in the larval condition lives in the louse of
this animal.The liver-fluke, Distomum hepaticum, occasionally found in
the liver of man, but of common occurrence in the sheep, to which it
proves so destructive in the affection known as rot, in the juvenile
condition lives in a little fresh-water snail of the genus Lymneus.The
guinea-worm, Filaria medinensis, which in the mature state is found
beneath the skin of man, in the larval condition inhabits the minute
crustacean cyclops of stagnant waters.As would be reasonably supposed, entozoa commonly gain access to their
hosts through the food and drink, though in the case of aquatic animals
they also obtain entrance directly through the integument from the
surrounding medium.So long as they remain in the intestinal canal they
may occasion little trouble or inconvenience.When they are numerous in
this position or proportionately large, according to their peculiar
nature they may produce more or less suffering and even the most
serious consequences.Generally, however, it is when they occupy other
positions, to which they have migrated from the intestine, that they
induce aggravated symptoms proportioned to their numbers and the nature
of the organs they infest.Many species of entozoa have been discovered in man, and most of them
are peculiar in kind.Many are common, and, while some are widely
extended, others are more or less restricted to certain localities.They are variable in their frequency, largely proportioned to the
prevalence of habits which are favorable to their transmission, and
which, though under control, are more or less disregarded.Some species
are so rare in their occurrence that they seem to be accidental, and
therefore of comparatively little interest to the physician.In general, the frequency of occurrence of intestinal worms is
proportioned to the extent of use of uncooked or insufficiently cooked
meats, the drinking of unfiltered standing waters, uncleanly habits,
and the intimacy of association with domestic animals.It therefore
follows that important prophylactics against infection by parasites are
properly-cooked food, the use of spring or freely-running water or
filtered standing water, cleanly habits, and the avoidance of intimacy
with domestic animals.The Cestodes, or Tape-worms.Tape-worms in the mature condition inhabit the intestines of vertebrate
animals, and are usually conspicuous for their long, tape-like
appearance and jointed character.In the juvenile or larval state they
infest the various organs, except the interior of the intestinal canal,
of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and in this condition are so
diminutive and inconspicuous that until a comparatively recent period
they for the most part remained unnoticed, and when known their
relationship with the mature forms was not recognized.The mature tape-worm, as ordinarily observed, is a long, soft, flat,
white worm, which from its resemblance has received its familiar name.{932} It has a small head, succeeded by a short, more slender neck
gradually widening into the body, which is divided transversely into
segments.These, which are usually called joints or links, and also
named proglottides, are so many individuals, and finally become
separated to hold an independent existence.The tape-worm clings to the
mucous membrane of the intestine by its head, which is provided for the
purpose with suckers, and in many cases also with circlets of hooks.The segments of the body are incessantly produced by gradual growth and
successive division of the neck, and as they enlarge they become more
distinct and develop within a bisexual generative apparatus for each.The worm has neither mouth nor intestine, but is nourished by
imbibition from the surrounding liquid in which it lies constantly
bathed.A pair of longitudinal vessels commences in the head and
extends throughout the body, one on each side, and in some genera is
joined by a transverse vessel at the fore and back part of every
segment.The mature segments have no body-cavity, but are occupied with
a complex bisexual generative apparatus, which is self-impregnating.Finally the uterus, usually much ramified, becomes especially
conspicuous through distension with eggs, and the rest of the organs
for the most part become atrophied.The ripe segments successively
detach themselves from those in advance, often singly and not
infrequently several linked together.In this condition, often in
lively movement, they are discharged with the feces, and thus commonly
render themselves obvious to their host.Subsequently they may continue
to live a brief period externally in a non-parasitic condition.Ordinarily, in moist excrement, or in water or similar materials, they
will remain alive for several days.After the discharge of the tape-worm segments, together with the eggs
which had been previously laid by the latter and those still contained
within them, any or all may be swallowed by animals feeding in places
where the infected excrement has been deposited.When the proglottides
and eggs are taken into the stomach they are digested and the embryos
or proscolices are liberated.The embryo or proscolex of the tape-worm is a microscopic spherical or
oval body, provided at one pole with three pairs of divergent spicules,
by which it is enabled to penetrate the walls of the stomach or
intestine of its host.From these positions the embryo migrates either
directly or through the blood-vessels to some other organ, most
frequently the liver or the muscles.Having reached its destination, it
becomes fixed in position, and for a time remains comparatively
quiescent, but undergoes further development.The embryo loses its
spicules and is transformed into the larval form or scolex.In most
species of tape-worms the scolex is simple or individual in character,
and consists of a head like that of the parent or mature worm, with a
neck ending in a capacious cyst, within which the head and neck are
inverted.In this form the scolex is contained in a sac of connective
tissue induced by the presence of the parasite.Such sacs, frequently
observed imbedded in the flesh, liver, lungs, and other organs of
animals, are familiarly known as measles.In this condition the
scolices of certain tape-worms have long been known, but as their
relationship was not recognized, they were viewed as distinct species
of parasites and described as cysticerci.In other species of
tape-worms the scolex is of compound character; that is to say, the
embryo {933} in its further development gives rise to the production of
one or more groups of individuals in conjunction.The compound scolex
thus forms a sac or a group of sacs, the basis of hydatid tumors.These
occur of various sizes, even up to that of a child's head, and may
occupy any organ of the body.They consist of a spherical sac or group
of sacs, simple in character or containing others, ranging in size from
that of a mustard-seed to that of a marble, or larger to that of a
walnut, enclosed in an envelope of connective tissue induced by the
presence of the parasite.The sacs are filled with liquid, and have,
attached within or free and floating, or less frequently attached
without, variable numbers of little white grains, which on examination
with the microscope exhibit the same constitution as the simple scolex
above described.As in the case of the cysticerci of measles, the
scolices of hydatids have long been known, but as their relationship
with the mature forms was unrecognized until lately, they were regarded
as distinct parasites and described as echinococci and coenuri.Sometimes the compound scolex fails in development further than the
production of the sacs, which then constitute the so-called
acephalocysts.Measles with their occupants, when retained in the muscles or other
organs, ordinarily undergo no further development, but ultimately,
after some months to a year or two, undergo degradation.The larva or
scolex dies and atrophies; the measle degenerates, and often becomes
the focus of calcareous deposit, shrinks to a little cicatrix, and may
finally disappear.Of a more serious nature is the tape-worm embryo
which produces the hydatid tumor.With the increase of this,
proportioned to the production of sacs and scolices, it may become so
large as greatly to interfere with the function of the organ it
occupies, and according to the nature of this organ will be the gravity
of the affection.When, however, the flesh or other parts of animals affected with
measles or hydatids containing active scolices are used as food in a
raw or insufficiently cooked state, the meats are digested in the
stomach and the scolices liberated to pursue their further development.Passing into the small intestine, the active scolex everts its head
from its caudal sac, which atrophies and disappears, and the parasite
attaches itself to the mucous membrane, and rapidly develops and grows
into the conspicuous and familiar form of the adult tape-worm.The
duration of life of the latter while maintaining its position in the
intestine is uncertain, but under favorable circumstances it commonly
continues for years, and thus, with the incessant production of ripe
segments charged with eggs, it becomes a constant focus of infection.*       *       *       *       *

Three species of tape-worm in the mature condition are common parasites
of man, living in the small intestine.They are the Taenia saginata,
Taenia solium, and Bothriocephalus latus.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA SAGINATA.--SYNONYMS: Taenia mediocanellata; Beef tape-worm;
Unarmed tape-worm; Fat tape-worm.Larval condition: Cysticercus saginata; Beef measle-worm.This, which is now regarded as the most common tape-worm of man, is
named the beef tape-worm because it is derived from the beef used as
food.In the mature condition it lives only in the small intestine of
{934} man, and in the juvenile condition it lives in the ox.Its
frequency is proportioned to the prevalence of the custom of eating
beef in a raw or insufficiently cooked state, conjoined with the
careless habit of leaving human excrement in pastures where it is
accessible to cattle.The mature beef tape-worm is commonly observed as a soft,
yellowish-white, thickish, band-like worm, ranging from six to twenty
feet or more in length.The head, about the size of a yellow
mustard-seed, is rounded quadrate and provided with four equidistant
hemispherical suckers.Succeeding the head is a short, slightly
narrower, flattened neck, which merges into the gradually widening and
segmented body.The segments, at first narrow fore and aft and several
times wider than the length, become successively larger,
proportionately longer, more distinct, and quadrate in outline; and
finally the length may exceed the breadth two or three times.A
full-grown tape-worm may possess twelve hundred segments and more, and
specimens are recorded as reaching a length of thirty feet.The larger
segments measure from a quarter of an inch to an inch long and from
three to four lines wide.The larger or riper segments exhibit on one
border, irregularly alternating on the two sides, at or near the
middle, a papilla in which is the external aperture of the genital
apparatus.In the fully-ripe segments the uterus, distended with eggs,
may be obscurely seen through the wall of the body, but is rendered
more visible by drying the segments, moderately compressed, between two
pieces of glass.It appears as a long, narrow, white or brownish median
line or tube, giving off laterally numerous short, transverse, more or
less branching tubes.The worm in its usual position lies along the course of the intestine
in loose coils, and exhibits lively movements, alternately shortening
and elongating, expanding and contracting the head, and protruding and
retracting the suckers.The ripe segments spontaneously detach
themselves, and may be found scattered along the large intestine ready
to be discharged with the excrement, or, as is sometimes the case, they
may spontaneously creep from the anus.Rarely more than a single worm
infests a person at the time.According
to Perroncito, quoted by Cobbold, a mature worm was reared from a beef
measle, swallowed by a student, in fifty-four days.It is estimated that the number of eggs in the mature segments of the
beef tape-worm amounts to about 35,000.As the full-grown worm may
consist of 1200 segments, and there is reason to believe these are
renewed several times annually, we learn that the whole number of eggs
produced by a single individual is enormous.The ripe segments,
attached to the parent or becoming spontaneously detached, lay their
eggs in the intestine to be discharged with the feces.When more or
less emptied they shrink and appear reduced in size, and in this
condition are expelled or spontaneously creep from the anus.If the
ripe segments are forcibly expelled and are alive, they will lay their
eggs in the feces externally.The ripe eggs are brown, oval, about 0.03
mm.long, and have a thick shell, with an outer vertically striated
envelope.As previously intimated, the common source of the beef tape-worm in man
is the use of raw or insufficiently cooked beef affected with measles.The ox becomes infested by swallowing the eggs, or, it may be, even the
entire segment, of a tape-worm deposited with feces in the {935}
pastures of cattle.The measles usually occur in the muscles, including
the heart, though they have also been noticed in the liver and lungs.They appear, in beef, as oval, whitish bodies from the size of a
mustard-seed to that of a pea.They consist of a sac of connective
tissue containing the larval tape-worm or cysticercus.Measles under
ordinary circumstances are seldom noticed in beef, and when they occur
are commonly few in number.According to the latest authorities--Leuckart, Cobbold, Stein, and
others--the beef tape-worm is the most common of the cestodes which
infest man.Until within about thirty years it was generally not
distinguished from the pork tape-worm, and this was accordingly
regarded as the most common human species.Since the writer distinctly
recognized the beef tape-worm within the last twenty years, all the
specimens of Taeniae, from people of Philadelphia and its vicinity,
that have been submitted to him for examination--perhaps in all about
fifty--have appeared to belong solely to Taenia saginata.The
prevalence of this species with us is no doubt due to the common custom
of eating underdone or too rare beef, while the pork tape-worm is
comparatively rare, as with us pork is only used in a well-cooked
condition.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA SOLIUM.--SYNONYMS: The Pork tape-worm; Solitary tape-worm; Armed
tape-worm.Larval condition: Cysticercus cellulosae; Pork measle-worm.Until a recent period this species was generally regarded as the most
common tape-worm of man--a view which in great measure was due to the
circumstance that the beef tape-worm was not distinguished from it.It
was called the solitary tape-worm, still expressed by the specific
name, from the impression that it rarely occurred otherwise than single
at a time in a person.This has also proved to be incorrect, likewise
due to the two kinds of tape-worms having been confounded together; for
while the beef tape-worm most commonly occurs solitary, the pork
tape-worm not unfrequently occurs with several together.The species is now appropriately named the pork tape-worm, as
indicating its common source--pork used as food.The frequency of the
parasite is proportioned to the prevalence of the custom of using pork
in a raw or imperfectly cooked state, conjoined with that of depositing
excrement where it may be accessible to hogs.In the mature condition
the pork tape-worm is peculiar to man and lives in the small intestine,
but in the larval condition, though especially infesting the hog, it
also occasionally infests man, and lives in any organs of the body, but
mostly the muscles, liver, and lungs.The mature pork tape-worm, as commonly seen, is a soft white, thin,
band-like worm, from five to ten feet long and about four lines where
widest.The head is spheroid, about the size of that of an ordinary
pin, and smaller than that of the beef tape-worm.It is furnished with
four hemispherical cup-like suckers, and the summit forms a blunt
papilla armed with a double circle of twenty-five or twenty-six hooks.The neck is narrow, thread-like, about an inch long, and merges into
the segmented body, which gradually widens to the extent mentioned.The
segments, at first much wider than long, as they successively enlarge
also become more distinct and proportionately longer, so that the more
{936} posterior ripe ones are as long as they are wide, and often
longer, though not to the same degree as in the beef tape-worm.The
genital papilla, with its external aperture, is marginal as in the
latter.The fully-developed uterus is quite distinctive in character
from that of the beef tape-worm.The median tube is coarser, and the
lateral branches are likewise coarser, much fewer--half the number or
fewer--less branched, and less crowded.The ripe and often
spontaneously detached segments are commonly longer than broad, more or
less elliptical in outline, with truncated ends, and usually measure
about half an inch in length by about a third in breadth.The ripe eggs
resemble those of the beef tape-worm, but are usually spheroid in
shape.The common source of the pork tape-worm is pork affected with measles
eaten in the raw or insufficiently cooked state.The hog becomes
affected with measles when it has access to human excrement containing
eggs and ripe segments of the tape-worm, which it eats with avidity.The eggs, with their already developed embryos, when swallowed, undergo
the same series of transformations and course as those indicated in the
account of the beef tape-worm.Pork affected with measles is much more
common than beef affected in the same way, and is frequently a subject
of ordinary observation.From the difference in habit of the hog and ox
this is what might have been suspected; and the fact that the beef
tape-worm is more common than the pork tape-worm is to be explained
from the circumstance that fresh beef is in more general use than pork,
and is usually employed less thoroughly cooked.The pork measles are commonly seen as round or oval, hard, whitish
bodies, from the size of a hempseed to that of a pea, imbedded in the
connective tissue of the muscles or flesh.The measle consists of a sac
of connective tissue enclosing the scolex or larval tape-worm, which
resembles that of the beef tape-worm, but differs especially in the
possession of a double circlet of hooks to the head, as in the adult
worm.The scolex has long been known, and was regarded as a distinct
parasite, with the name of Cysticercus cellulosae.When fresh pork
measles are swallowed by man they are digested in the stomach, and the
cysticercus or scolex is released and passes into the small intestine.Here, attaching itself to the mucous membrane by means of its suckers
and crown of hooks, it rapidly develops and grows into the adult
tape-worm.In this condition it lies in loose folds along the
intestine, to which it clings so tenaciously that commonly the neck
gives way when the greater part of the worm is forcibly detached by the
use of medicines.Fragments, consisting of the more mature segments,
frequently appear detached from the posterior part of the worm, and the
fully-ripe segments may be seen scattered singly in the course of the
large intestine.The isolated segments are thinner and more translucent
than those of the beef tape-worm, and in this condition are discharged
with the feces, but may also spontaneously creep from the anus, though
seldom as compared with the other species.Experiments repeatedly made by swallowing pork measles prove that the
mature tape-worm may be developed in the course of three months.The
length of life attained by it under favorable circumstances is
uncertain, but it probably continues a dozen years or more.The scolex of the pork tape-worm, or the cysticercus, so common in the
hog, is also less frequently a parasite of man, and in this condition
is a {937} more potent agent of danger than in its ordinary or mature
state.The infection is due to the introduction of eggs or mature
segments of the tape-worm into the stomach--a circumstance which may
readily occur through handling these objects and transferring them to
the mouth, or more rarely perhaps by their transference from the
intestine into the stomach through vomiting.In the measle form the parasite may occur in any organ of the body, but
is mostly found in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue.Its
pathological significance depends on its number and position.Located
in the nerve-centres, it may occasion the most serious consequences.Usually it occurs in small numbers and gives rise to no obvious
inconvenience, and is only accidentally detected in dissection after
death.It appears to maintain its vitality for some years, but finally
dies, and undergoes degradation.Only when it can be detected in such
position as the interior of the eye or beneath the conjunctiva can the
patient be relieved by surgical aid.Elsewhere, even if its presence is
suspected, it is ordinarily beyond the reach of medical treatment.The
writer a few years since, in dissecting the body of a <DW52> man to
illustrate his lectures on the muscles, found two living measles, of
which one was in the diaphragm and the other in the transversalis
muscle of the abdomen, but none were detected elsewhere.The parasite
unquestionably gave no inconvenience to its host during life.*       *       *       *       *

Other species of Taenia which have been observed as parasitic in the
human intestine are mostly of rare occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA CUCUMERINA, the common tape-worm of the dog, and TAENIA
ELLIPTICA, the common tape-worm of the cat, are very much alike in
appearance, and are regarded by many authorities as the same species.They occur frequently in considerable numbers in these animals, living
in the small intestine.They have also been occasionally found in man,
especially children.It is a comparatively delicate worm, chain-like in appearance, ranging
from four inches to a foot in length.The head is provided with four
suckers and a prominent rostellum armed with about sixty hooks.The
neck and anterior part of the body are thread-like.The mature segments
are elliptical in outline or like a melon-seed, whence the name.There
is a double set of sexual organs, and a genital orifice occupies the
middle of both lateral margins of the segments.The ripe segments
become readily detached and creep actively in the intestine, and are
either expelled with the feces or they spontaneously creep from the
anus.The eggs are comparatively few and measure 0.05 mm.Late researches appear to show that the eggs adhering to the hair about
the anus or elsewhere are eaten by lice of the same animals, and within
these insects undergo further development.The dog and cat,
subsequently swallowing the lice, infect themselves with the mature
worms.Thus also persons, especially children, from too great
familiarity with these animals, directly or through their food, may
likewise become infected.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA NANA, the Dwarf tape-worm, has been observed but once.It was
discovered by Bilharz, in Egypt, in a boy who died of meningitis.It
{938} is a little worm, about half an inch in length, and occurred in
large numbers in the duodenum.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA TENELLA.--This is another small species, which has been but once
observed.It is described by Cobbold, who suspects it to be derived
from measles of the sheep.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA FLAVOPUNCTATA is also a small species, from eight to ten inches
long, with ripe joints about one millimeter long and from one and a
half to two millimeters broad.It is described by Weinland, and has
also been but once observed.A half-dozen specimens were discharged
from a healthy child, of nineteen months, in Boston, Mass.Since the above was written the author has had the opportunity of
examining some little tape-worms which he suspects to be of the same
kind as the former.They occurred in the practice of T. V. Crandall in
Philadelphia, and were expelled from a child of three years of age
after the use of santonin.About a dozen fragments appear to have
pertained to three worms, from twelve to fifteen inches in length.The anterior part of the body is thread-like, the
posterior part about two and a quarter millimeters wide.The width of
the joints is more than twice the length.The ripe joints are pale
brown, and are remarkable for the comparative simplicity of the uterus,
which is distended with brown eggs.A peculiarity of the worm is the
repeated but irregular alternation of fertile with sterile joints.[1]

[Footnote 1: _Amer.of Medical Sciences_, 1884, p.The species is probably more common than might be supposed, and from
its small size, and perhaps harmless character, has generally escaped
notice.*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA MADAGASCARIENSIS.--This species, described by Davaine, is
imperfectly known.Fragments of the worm have been twice observed in
the Comoro Islands.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS LATUS.--SYNONYMS: Dibothrium latum; Taenia lata; Broad
tape-worm.This tape-worm, of another genus than the preceding, is a common
parasite of man in certain localities of Europe, but has not been found
as an indigenous product elsewhere.It occurs especially in Sweden and
Russia, East Prussia, Poland, and West Switzerland.In the latter
country it prevails to such an extent that it is reported that about
one-fourth of the inhabitants of Geneva are thus infested.Among the
tape-worms submitted to the writer from time to time for identification
a few years ago was a large specimen of Bothriocephalus latus, but it
proved to have been derived from a Swede who had arrived in this
country only a few months previously.There are many species of Bothriocephalus, which in the adult condition
mainly live in fishes.The genus is distinguished from Taenia by many
points, chiefly in the form and construction of the head, the form of
the joints and uterus, and the position of the genital aperture, which
is situated centrally on one of the broad surfaces instead of the
lateral margin.{939} The broad tape-worm is the largest of the tape-worms infesting
man, a full-grown specimen reaching to twenty-five feet in length with
a breadth of three-fourths of an inch, and consisting of upward of four
thousand segments.It is a soft, grayish, flat, band-like worm, with
head, neck, and segmented body holding the same proportions as in the
other tape-worms.The head is elongated, clavate, and is provided with
a long, narrow, elliptical sucker on each side.The narrower neck is
short and merges into the segmented body, which gradually widens to
half an inch or more.As the segments successively enlarge, they
increase proportionately to a greater extent in breadth, so that their
width for the most part measures from two to four times their length.A
few toward the end of the series become narrower and longer than those
in advance.In the ripe segments the uterus, distended with brownish
eggs, forms a central rosette-like group of pouches.The genital
aperture is central in the broad surface of the segments, and is always
on the same or ventral side.The broad tape-worm inhabits the small intestine, and is usually found
single, but occasionally several together, and sometimes also in
association with one or both the other common tape-worms.The species
is also reported to be not infrequent in the dog.Ripe portions of the broad tape-worm become detached in fragments of
variable length, to be discharged with the feces.The partially-emptied
appearance of the uteri in these fragments indicates the laying of the
eggs previous to the expulsion of the latter.The eggs are oval, of a
light-brown color, and measure about 0.07 mm.The shell at one
pole is furnished with an operculum or lid for the escape of the
embryo.This is developed subsequently to the discharge of the eggs
from the intestine.If the eggs are placed in water, in the course of
some months the embryos are developed and escape from the shell.The
embryo is a round or oval body furnished with three pairs of spicules,
as in that of the Taeniae, but differs in possessing a ciliated
envelope, by means of which it freely swims about in the water.After
some days the embryo discards its envelope and creeps about in an
amoeboid manner.Further than this, until recently, the fate of the
embryo was unknown.Petersburg, after determining the
presence of scolices of Bothriocephalus in the muscles, liver, and
organs of generation of the pike, trout, and eel-pout, by feeding these
to cats and dogs succeeded in rearing worms which differed in no
respect, except in being smaller, from the Bothriocephalus latus of
man.Such being the case, it becomes evident that man may ordinarily
become infested with the parasite by eating raw or insufficiently
cooked fishes of the kind mentioned.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS CORDATUS, described by Leuckart as a common species
infesting the dog in Greenland, has been reported as having once been
found in a woman.Bottger regards it as not distinct from
Bothriocephalus latus.*       *       *       *       *

BOTHRIOCEPHALUS CRISTATUS.--This species, but once observed, is
described by Davaine.It was passed by a child in Paris, and the worm
was upward of nine feet in length.*       *       *       *       *

SYMPTOMS OF TAPE-WORMS.--Whichever may be the species of {940}
tape-worm infesting the human intestine, the symptoms to which it gives
rise are mainly of the same character, modified of course in degree by
the size and number of the parasites and the susceptibilities of the
patient.Clinging by means of the head to the mucous membrane of the
intestine, and involved among the valvulae conniventes and villi, the
worm may extend in loose folds along the greater part of the course of
the intestine or lie coiled in an elongate mass.Besides being rendered
evident from time to time by the discharge of segments or fragments,
the beef tape-worm especially sometimes introduces itself to the notice
of its host through the segments creeping from the anus.Sometimes
segments of tape-worms are vomited, especially in women; and the
exhibition in this way, especially of the pork tape-worm, is to be
deplored, for should segments be retained in the stomach the patient
becomes further liable to be affected with measles or cysticerci.Some persons continue infested with a tape-worm a long time without
suspecting its existence and with little or no inconvenience, and
perhaps first become aware of its presence by the accidental discovery
of segments discharged from the bowels.Usually, however, the parasite
creates more or less disturbance, and not unfrequently occasions great
discomfort.The symptoms are both local and of a general nature.Itching at the extremities of the alimentary canal and various
dyspeptic symptoms are common; uncomfortable sensations in the abdomen,
uneasiness, fulness or emptiness, feeling of movement attributed to the
worm, and colicky pains; disordered appetite, sometimes deficient,
oftener craving; paleness, discoloration around the eyes, furred
tongue, fetid breath, and sometimes emaciation; fulness of the
forehead, dull headache, buzzing in the ears, twitching of the face,
and dizziness; often uncomfortable feelings in the abdomen increased by
fasting, which are temporarily relieved by taking a full meal.Certain
kinds of food also at times appear to produce greater uneasiness,
apparently due to more than usual disturbance of the parasite.Symptoms
of a more grave character are sensations of fainting, chorea, and
epileptic fits.Others of a chlorotic and hysterical character are not
unfrequent, especially in women, who also may suffer more or less from
uterine disorder.All the ordinary symptoms are quickly relieved by the expulsion of the
tape-worm--permanently if it is entirely removed, but temporarily, as
is frequently the case, when only the greater bulk of the parasite is
discharged and the head continues to remain securely attached to the
intestine and ready to renew its many-segmented body.The tape-worms
are capable of a wonderful amount of extension from traction without
detachment; and from the delicacy of the neck and the anterior part of
the body, and the action of medicine on the peristaltic motion of the
intestine, the posterior part of the worm, including its great bulk, is
most apt to be torn away and discharged, while the head remains.So
long as this is the case, and the worm has not been poisoned or killed,
the anterior portion grows, and thus the parasite is renewed and
accompanied by a return of all the former symptoms.Under the
appropriate treatment the evacuations of the patient should be
carefully inspected, so as to satisfy both physician and patient that
the parasite has been completely expelled.To properly examine the
evacuations, they should be repeatedly drenched with clear water, and
the sediment, after the settling {941} of the washings, must be
inspected.It is only when the physician has seen the head of the
parasite that he can reasonably ensure his patient a permanent cure.*       *       *       *       *

TREATMENT.--To get rid of tape-worms many remedies have been employed,
though comparatively few retain a reputation for positive success.Some
act by powerfully operating on both bowels and worms, producing the
detachment and discharge of the latter without killing them, as is
often indicated in the lively movements they exhibit after their
expulsion.Others poison and kill the worms, and also cause their
detachment and expulsion from the bowel.Before the administration of the appropriate medicine for tape-worms,
with the object of rendering it more effective it is advisable to bring
the alimentary canal into a condition which will render the parasites
most vulnerable.For this purpose fasting is to be recommended for
several days previously, and when food is used it should be in moderate
quantity, and of such a character as to leave little residue to
accumulate in the intestine.Wheat bread, the ordinary meats, milk and
coffee, are best, while the usual vegetables should be avoided.One of the most effective remedies is the oil of turpentine in the dose
of one or two fluidounces, made into an emulsion with white of egg and
sugar; children require about half the quantity.The large dose is less
apt to produce the usual objectionable effects of that medicine than
small ones.The only inconvenience caused by it is the heat of the
stomach, some febrile excitement, and fulness of the head or headache
lasting for one or two days.The effects are more apt to occur when the
medicine does not act as a cathartic.The oil usually operates quickly,
killing the worm and producing its discharge.If it does not act in the
course of two or three hours, a full dose of castor oil may be given,
and, if necessary to aid the action of this, enemata may be employed.To ensure the purgative action of the oil of turpentine it may be
advantageously associated with the castor oil, of each a fluidounce
made into an emulsion.Another and effective remedy is the root of the male fern, Aspidium
filix-mas, used in decoction or electuary.Stein of Frankfort
recommends the ethereal extract as the best preparation, and prescribes
it in doses of from seven to ten grammes, enclosed in half the number
of gelatin capsules and administered at short intervals within half an
hour.It should be taken in the morning fasting, after taking a cup of
coffee, swallowing the capsules with the aid of a second cup.Half an
hour after the capsules are taken a mixture of castor oil, brandy, and
ginger syrup, of each fifteen grammes, should be administered.The
treatment has proved all that could be desired, and the worm, including
the head, is discharged altogether, rolled into a ball.The bark of the pomegranate-root, Punica granatum, is also a powerful
and efficient remedy, but often proves very disagreeable from its
producing violent pains in the abdomen, with nausea and vomiting.It
also generally purges, occasioning the discharge of the worm.Kuchenmeister prefers it to any other medicine, given in the form of
decoction prepared by macerating three ounces of the fresh bark in
twelve fluidounces of water for twelve hours, and concentrating the
infusion by gentle heat to one-half.He recommends it to be taken after
fasting a day and the {942} administration at night of two fluidounces
of castor oil.It is to be given in three or four doses within an hour.Should the medicine not purge, it should be followed by another dose of
castor oil.Recently, Feraud has recommended the tannate of pelletierin, the
alkaloid of which is derived from the pomegranate-root, as the most
powerful of remedies for tape-worm, the dose for an adult being
one-half to three-fourths of a grain.The patient should fast a day on
bread and milk, and the following morning, before rising, take an
infusion of one-third of an ounce of senna.This should be followed an
hour later by half the medicine diffused in a little water, and the
patient should remain quiet in bed to avoid nausea and vomiting.Half
an hour later the rest of the medicine is to be given, followed in
another half hour by a dose of castor oil.Should there be no stool
after an hour, purgative enemata may be used.In one case twelve beef
tape-worms were discharged together measuring, collectively, fifty
meters.Kousso, the flower of Brayera anthelmintica, an Abyssinian herb, has
been of late much employed as a remedy for tape-worms, but with many
physicians of experience it has lost favor.Heller speaks of it highly,
and recommends it to be taken in the morning, an hour after the patient
has taken coffee.The dose is from half an ounce to an ounce, and is
conveniently taken in compressed balls or disks, coated with gelatin,
and swallowed at intervals in the course of an hour, aided by mouthfuls
of coffee.Any disposition to vomit should be repressed, which is
rendered easier by taking small mouthfuls of strong coffee or pieces of
ice.Koussin, an alcoholic preparation of kousso, is also efficient, and has
the advantage over the latter that it does not occasion nausea.It has
been used in the medical clinic of Munich in the dose of 30 grains, and
it has been a very rare occurrence that the result was not all that
could be desired.The seeds of the common pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo, are extolled by many
physicians as a remedy for tape-worms; and the writer has twice had the
opportunity of observing large specimens of the beef tape-worm which
were expelled after the administration of this medicine.The dose is an
ounce of the seeds bruised into a paste and made into an emulsion.It
should be taken in the morning, fasting, and followed in an hour or two
with a full dose of castor oil.Santonin, a principle derived from santonica, Artemisia maritima, is
reported as a remedy for tape-worms, but its efficacy has also been
denied.The dose is from two to four grains for an adult, and from
one-quarter to one-half a grain for children over two years.It is best
administered in lozenges prepared with sugar and tragacanth.The quinia sulphate has also been recommended as an effectual remedy
both in tape- and seat-worms.As regards the prophylaxis of tape-worms, there are some important
points to which we direct attention.The evacuations of patients containing tape-worms, their segments and
eggs, should not be carelessly thrown away, at least in places
accessible to animals which may become infected.They should be treated
with boiling water, the heat of which is sufficient to kill all animal
parasites.The handling of living tape-worms and segments should be
avoided, as eggs {943} which may adhere to the hands, if transferred to
the mouth and swallowed, will produce infection.Meats visibly infested with measles are not fit and should not be used
as food.Raw meat should altogether be discarded as food, both for the
sick and well, and all meats should be thoroughly cooked.As a rule,
meat should not be used so long as it appears red or on cutting emits a
bloody liquid.A large piece of meat requires long boiling or roasting
for sufficient heat to penetrate to the interior to destroy any
parasites that may be present.Even salted meats and hams should be
cooked to ensure against parasitic infection.It is important also to
avoid food prepared by uncleanly persons who may be infested with
tape-worms.As regards our domestic animals, which are the common source of the
infection of man with tape-worms, they should also be protected from
infection as far as possible.This is to be done by preventing them
from having access to human excrement.As Heller remarks, with this
object the barbarous custom of defecating in every place promiscuously
should be put down with a high hand.[2]

[Footnote 2: Several years since a physician of Texas sent to the
writer a piece of pork, making inquiry as to its condition, and stating
that all the pigs of his vicinity were diseased and their flesh
similarly affected.It contained a number of measles or larval
tape-worms.On giving the information and the probable cause of the
affection of the pigs, the doctor reported in return that there was not
a privy in his village.Until our people are more careful with the
raising of pigs, European governments will have reason for prohibiting
the importation of our pork.]*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA ECHINOCOCCUS.--SYNONYM: Hydatid tape-worm.Larval condition: Echinococcus; E. hominis; E. veterinorum; E.
granulosis; E. scolicipariens; E. altricipariens; E. hydatidosus; E.
multilocularis; E. cyst; Hydatid; Hydatid cyst; Acephalocyst.This tape-worm, in its mature state the most insignificant looking of
its kind, though not strictly an intestinal worm of man, in the
juvenile condition is one of his most dangerous parasites, as being the
source of hydatid tumors.The adult tape-worm lives in the small
intestine of the dog and wolf, in some localities often existing in
these animals in thousands together.From its diminutive size it may be
readily overlooked, concealed or obscured by the villi among which it
is suspended to the mucous membrane.It is about a fourth of an inch in
length, and consists of but four segments, of which the last alone
exhibits the ripe condition.The head resembles in construction that of
the pork tape-worm, being provided with four suckers and a prominent
crown, with from thirty to fifty hooks arranged in a double circle.The
terminal ripe segment exceeds in size all the preceding together, and
before it separates from the series another is ready to take its place.The ripe eggs contain the usual six-spined embryo as in other
tape-worms.The mature worm is remarkable for the comparative shortness of its
life, which, according to Siebold, is about seven weeks.Apparently to
compensate for the small number of its segments, the larval form is
endowed with the power of multiplying itself to a wonderful degree.It is only in the larval condition that the hydatid tape-worm infests
man, and in this state also it infests the ape, the ox and sheep and
other ruminants, also the horse, hog, and indeed many other animals of
the same class.{944} If the eggs of the tape-worm are swallowed, which may readily
happen by too free intimacy or association with infested dogs, the
liberated embryos obtain access to the intestine.Penetrating the
mucous membrane, the embryos thence may migrate to any part of the
body.From the comparative frequency of hydatid tumors in the liver we
may suspect they mostly enter the portal venous system and take the
course of the blood-current.It is, however, probable that they migrate
directly to their destination, for hydatid tumors are also frequently
seated in the neighboring organs and the abdominal walls.The embryo
tape-worm, once fixed in position, becomes the starting-point of a
hydatid tumor.When dogs are fed on the liver, or other parts affected with hydatid
tumors, from the sheep or other animals, the scolices are liberated,
and, passing into the small intestine, are there developed into the
mature tape-worms.Hydatid tumors occur in any of the organs of the body, but are more
frequent in the liver than in all others together.They are common in
the lungs, kidneys, spleen, omentum, and subperitoneal tissue of the
abdominal walls.They are less common in the heart, brain, spinal
canal, the pelvic viscera, and the bones.Mostly but a single tumor is
found in the same person, but occasionally several occur together in
the same or in different organs.There are several varieties of the hydatid tumor.In man the more
common form consists of a cyst or a group of cysts enclosed in a
connective-tissue envelope induced by the presence of the parasite.The
simple cyst is produced through the transformation of the echinococcus
embryo, and the group of cysts is derived from the former by
proliferation; and hence the first has been called the parent cyst, and
the others the daughter cysts.These also in the same manner may
produce a third series, called granddaughter cysts.The parent cyst, at
first spherical, becomes modified in shape according to the space it
occupies and the resistance to which it is subjected, thus assuming an
oval, lobulated, or other form.It may increase in size to that of a
cocoanut or larger, and may remain simple, but usually is compounded by
proliferation in the production of daughter cysts.These may be few or
many up to hundreds, and range from a minute size up to that of a
walnut, and are spherical or modified in shape by mutual pressure or
other cause.The cysts are filled with a clear watery liquid of saline
taste, but without albumen.The hydatid cysts are usually composed of an outer thick, translucent,
homogeneous, laminated, glistening, highly elastic membrane, the
ectocyst, and an inner thin, granular, and cellular layer, the
endocyst.From the endocyst originate minute buds, which become the
brood-capsules of the larval worms or scolices.These form little
groups of a few to a dozen individuals suspended within the
brood-capsules, but capable of eversion from them.The individual
scolices, which appear to the naked eye as mere white points, have the
form and construction of the head-segment of the mature Taenia
echinococcus.After death or by violence they become easily detached,
and then float free in the liquid containing them.In some cases the
echinococcus cysts develop no scolices, in which condition they
constitute acephalocysts.Occasionally the echinococcus embryo
undergoes imperfect development, constituting the multilocular hydatid
tumor, rarely found elsewhere than in the liver.{945} Echinococcal tumors, especially those which have many daughter
cysts, when accessible are remarkable for exhibiting a tremulous
movement when grasped by the hand and quickly tapped with the finger.Infection through the embryonic form of the Taenia echinococcus, as the
source of hydatid tumors, is productive of the most disastrous
consequences, and has ended in the destruction of many lives both of
men and domestic animals.The parasite is not directly productive of
suffering, but its effects and dangers are proportioned to the size of
the tumor it occasions and the character and importance to life of the
organ in which the latter is situated.With the increase of the hydatid
tumor, usually of very slow growth, it encroaches upon the surrounding
parts, and if these are not displaced they become disorganized and
atrophied.The liability and frequency of infection with the hydatid disease
appear to be proportioned to the prevalence of intimate association
with the dog.In Iceland, in which it is said every peasant owns half a
dozen dogs, which share his dwelling with him, it is also reported that
one-sixth of all the deaths are due to the hydatid parasite.Ordinarily, the hydatid disease is beyond the reach of medical
treatment.The mercurials and potassium iodide have been recommended,
but the results are very doubtful.Apparently as an indication how
little hydatid parasites may be influenced by medicine, the following
incident will show: The writer once received for dissection the body of
an English sailor which had been injected with zinc chloride for
preservation.In the abdominal wall in the right iliac region there was
a hydatid tumor the size of a fist.On examination of the tumor it was
found full of daughter cysts, and these contained living scolices,
though the man had been dead several days and the tissues were bleached
by the zinc solution.Favorable results in the treatment of hydatid tumors are only to be
expected through surgical means when they are accessible.As a prophylactic measure against infection the avoidance of too
intimate association with dogs is especially to be recommended.In concluding the chapter on Taenia echinococcus, as a prophylactic
against this and other parasites Cobbold gives the advice that "all
entozoa which are not preserved for scientific investigation or
experiment should be destroyed by fire when practicable, and under no
circumstances whatever should they be thrown aside as harmless refuse."*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA ACANTHOTRIAS.Larval condition: Cysticercus acanthotrias.This species has been but once observed, and only in the larval
condition or that of the scolex, which was first described by Weinland.About a dozen specimens were found by Jefferies Wyman of Boston in the
body of a woman of Virginia who died of phthisis.They were situated in
the connective tissue beneath the skin and in the muscles, except one,
which was attached to the dura mater.The scolex is distinguishable
from that of the other human tape-worms in possessing a triple circle
of hooks.{946} The Trematodes, or Fluke-worms.The trematodes or fluke-worms, though allied to the tape-worms, differ
in many important characters.In the mature condition, like the latter,
they are solid worms or are devoid of a body cavity or coelum, and are
with rare exceptions hermaphroditic.They are, however, never compound,
but simple or consist of single individuals, and are provided with a
mouth and alimentary canal, but this is closed or is without an anal
aperture.They have a water vascular system, communicating with the
exterior by a pore at the posterior extremity of the body.They are
commonly of flat, elliptical shape, with a sucker-like mouth at the
fore end, and with a second sucker situated ventrally near the middle.The fluke-worms are remarkable for their successive transformations and
course of life, and, like the tape-worms, they pass the different
stages of their existence in different animals.A number of species
have been described as infesting man, but most of them are,
fortunately, of rare occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM HEPATICUM.--SYNONYMS: Fasciola hepatica; Liver-fluke.This species, the common liver-fluke, occasionally occurs in the human
body, but is especially frequent in the sheep and other ruminating
animals, as the ox, goat, and deer, and it likewise occurs in the
horse, hog, and some other animals.It usually inhabits the liver,
occupying the bile-ducts, but is also sometimes found in the portal and
other veins and in the intestine, and more rarely in abscesses beneath
the skin.It is the cause of the affection in sheep called rot, of
which many thousands die annually.The liver-fluke is a flat, tongue-shaped, brownish worm about an inch
long and about half as wide.It is invested with minute scale-like
spines.The head end is somewhat prolonged, and terminates in a small
oral sucker, a short distance behind which is a small ventral sucker.The intestine is forked and much branched.The genital aperture is
situated between the oral and ventral suckers.The commonly yellowish
eggs are numerous and large, oval, and measure about 0.135 mm.The common liver-fluke frequently occurs in large numbers, even
hundreds, in the liver of the sheep, obstructing the bile-ducts and
occasioning more or less destruction of the organ.The eggs pass off
with the bile into the intestine, and are discharged with the
excrement.In water the eggs are hatched, and deliver a ciliated and
freely-swimming embryo.This in favorable positions, such as marshy
pastures, obtains access to small fresh-water snails and penetrates to
the interior of their body.Here the embryo sheds its ciliated
integument and is transformed into a sporocyst.This is an elliptical
pouch containing reproductive bodies, which become developed into
individuals of more elongated form than the sporocyst, provided with a
mouth and stomach, and named redias, or nurses.The nurse penetrates to
the liver of the snail, and there develops within itself new forms
called cercarias, which resemble the parent fluke-worm, but are
provided with a long, powerful tail and have no apparent generative
apparatus.The cercaria escapes through an aperture of the nurse, and
makes its way out of the snail into the water, where it swims about
actively by means of the tail, much in the manner of a tadpole.{947}
The cercaria after a time fixes itself to a submerged plant, becomes
encysted, shakes off its tail, and remains in a quiescent state.If in
this condition, in the feeding of sheep or other animals, the tailless
cercaria or incipient fluke-worm is transferred to the stomach, it
makes its way to the liver, and there grows and is developed into the
sexually mature worm.Recently it has been ascertained both in England and Germany that the
juvenile state of the fluke-worm is passed especially in the little
fresh-water snail Lymneus truncatulus.As, however, the common
liver-fluke occurs in America, while the last-named species of Lymneus
does not, it is rendered probable that the juvenile condition of the
parasite also occurs in other species of snails.Incidentally, the
writer may here mention that he has found certain of our smallest
fresh-water snails, such as Planorbis parvus, frequenting meadows in
the vicinity of our rivers and creeks, swarming with nurses of several
different species of fluke-worms.Notwithstanding the frequency of the common liver-fluke in the sheep
and other domestic animals, its occurrence has been rare in man, and in
all the cases reported it has been few in number, either single or from
two to half a dozen.In man it has been found to occupy the bile-ducts,
the portal vein, and abscesses beneath the skin.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM LANCEOLATUM.--SYNONYM: Smaller Liver-fluke.This species, much smaller than the preceding, is of lanceolate form,
acute behind, smooth, and about a third of an inch long.Its suckers
are moderately large, and the bifurcate intestine is unbranched.It
infests the liver of the sheep and ox and some other animals, and not
unfrequently is found in association with the former species.It
usually does not occur in such great numbers together as in the latter;
from which and other circumstances, as the smaller size and smooth
investment, it does not produce the same serious results.Its
continuous history remains unknown, though it is probable that its
course is similar to that of the common liver-fluke.Several cases are
reported of its occurrence as a parasite in man.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM SINENSE.--Under this head Cobbold has recently described a
species somewhat larger than the D. lanceolatum.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM CONJUNCTUM.--Another species described by Cobbold under this
name, originally found in the liver of an American fox, has also been
detected in man.The worm is about one-fourth of an inch long.*       *       *       *       *

SYMPTOMS.--Cases of fluke-worms in the human liver have occurred so
rarely that we are not prepared to indicate with certainty what may be
the nature of the peculiar symptoms.If the parasites were numerous,
they would give rise to more or less obstruction of the bile-ducts,
with accumulation of bile, accompanied with jaundice and other symptoms
usually attendant on functional disturbance of the liver.As in sheep,
they would occasion dilatation of the bile-ducts, catarrhal
inflammation, incrustation with biliary matters, hyperplasia of the
surrounding {948} tissues, and more or less disorganization and atrophy
of the secretory structure.TREATMENT.--As regards the treatment, we can say almost nothing.In the
destructive disease of rot in sheep there are no known means to expel
the parasites from the liver.If present in man, as they occur but few
in number, we may hope for their spontaneous expulsion in due time
without leaving any serious result.As a means of prophylaxis persons
should carefully avoid salads prepared from subaquatic vegetables, like
cress, which may harbor little fresh-water snails.Daniel travelled to the kitchen.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM HETEROPHYES.--This is a small species, about half a line long,
with the fore part of the body covered with minute spines, and having a
large, nearly central, ventral disk.It has been but once observed, and
was reported by Bilharz, in Cairo, as having been found, in the
post-mortem examination of a boy, in the small intestine, in which it
existed in hundreds.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM CRASSUM.--This is the largest of the fluke-worms infesting
man, and measures from one to three inches in length.It is elliptical,
comparatively thick, and smooth.The two suckers have nearly the same
relative size and position as in the D. hepaticum.It inhabits the
duodenum, and has been observed a number of times infesting inhabitants
of China and India.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM RINGERI.--A species by this name, about half an inch long, has
recently been described by Cobbold as infesting the lungs of people in
Formosa and China.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM OPHTHALMOBIUM.--A minute species, described under this name,
has been detected several times in the human eye.*       *       *       *       *

BILHARZIA HAEMATOBIA.--SYNONYM: Distomum haematobium.As a human parasite this is the most important of the fluke-worms,
being the most common and dangerous.It is apparently restricted to
Africa and Arabia, and is especially frequent in Egypt, Abyssinia, the
Cape of Good Hope, and Natal.So far as known, it is peculiar to man
and monkeys, and inhabits the veins, especially those of the portal
system, and it lives on the blood.The blood fluke-worm is remarkable among its kind in having the sexes
distinct.The female is slender, cylindrical, and tapering toward the
ends, looking more like an ordinary thread-worm than a fluke-worm, and
is about three-fourths of an inch long.The male is about half an inch
long, but wider than the female, which it partially embraces at
maturity by doubling upon it laterally.This parasite, of the same essential nature as the more ordinary
fluke-worms, is most probably introduced in the juvenile condition into
the stomach by drinking unfiltered standing waters, and perhaps also by
eating vegetables which grow in wet places and upon which the young
fluke-worms may be encysted.From the stomach the worms gain access to
the portal venous system, within which they undergo development to
sexual maturity.The worms, proportioned to their number, {949}
occasion more or less sudden and dangerous haematuria.According to
Bilharz, who first discovered the parasite, it also induces
inflammation of the ureters, bladder, and rectum, accompanied with
ulceration and incrustations and concretions in the same, due to the
abundant deposit of eggs in the mucous membrane.The symptoms in the
haematuria are obvious; all treatment fails, but the prophylaxis is
evident.*       *       *       *       *

AMPHISTOMUM HOMINIS.--The genus Amphistomum is distinguished from
Distomum in having the ventral disk placed at the posterior extremity
of the body.A species has been recently described by Cobbold under the above name,
and is reported as having been observed several times in natives of
India.It is a red worm, about the fourth of an inch long, and inhabits
the caecum and ascending colon, in which it was found in hundreds
together.The mucous membrane exhibited venous congestion and was
marked with numerous red spots resembling leech-bites, produced by the
parasites.One of the patients died of cholera.We have too little information as to the symptoms induced by this
parasite, and of its treatment, to say anything.It is probable that
calomel, turpentine, and castor oil would be appropriate remedies.Several other fluke-worms which have been reported as having been found
in the human body are generally viewed with doubt as to their
genuineness.Such are the Hexathyridium pinguicola, from a tumor of the
ovary; the H. venarum, said to have been found in the blood and in the
sputum of haemoptysis; and the Tetrastomum renale, said to have been
found in the urine.The Acanthocephali, or Thorn-head Worms.The thorn-head worms in the mature condition are comparatively robust
cylindrical worms, with a body-cavity or coelum, but devoid of mouth
and alimentary canal.They are provided with a protrusile and
retractile proboscis-like head armed with circular rows of recurved
hooks, by which they firmly cling to the wall of the intestine of their
host.There are many species, which mostly in
the mature state live in fishes.In the juvenile or larval condition
they live in other animals, mostly crustaceans and insects.It is
doubtful whether any species naturally infests man.*       *       *       *       *

ECHINORHYNCHUS GIGAS.--The great thorn-head worm is a common parasite
of the hog, living in the small intestine.It is a large white worm,
the female of which reaches a foot in length, while the male is about
one-third the size.It is doubtful whether it occurs as a human
parasite, though a worm less than the fourth of an inch found in a man
in Prague has been attributed to this species.The Nematodes, or Thread-worms.The nematodes, or thread-worms, are slender, cylindrical, and
inarticulate, and usually more or less tapering toward one or both
extremities.{950} They have a distinct coelum or body-cavity, with
thick muscular walls limited by a transparent elastic, chitinous
integument, which is sometimes more or less distinctly and regularly
transversely wrinkled.The alimentary canal extends the length of the
coelum, with the mouth at the anterior extremity, and usually an anus
at or near the posterior extremity.In some forms in the mature
condition the intestine is atrophied and the anus absent.The sexes are
distinct, and commonly the male is very much smaller than the female.The organs of generation occupy the coelum along the sides of the
intestine.The female aperture is commonly situated ventrally near or
in advance of the middle of the body, while the male aperture is at or
in the vicinity of the anus.Mostly, the worms are oviparous, but many
are viviparous.The development is direct, and usually the
transformations are inconspicuous, so that the embryos mostly differ
but little from the parent, except in the absence of the generative
apparatus.*       *       *       *       *

OXYURIS VERMICULARIS.--SYNONYMS: Ascaris vermicularis; Seat-worm;
Pin-worm; Maw-worm; Maggot-worm; Thread-worm; Ascarides.The seat-worm is the most common intestinal parasite of man, prevails
everywhere, and is peculiar to him.It is a lively, wriggling creature
which inhabits the small and large intestines and feeds on their
contents.It frequently occurs in large numbers together, and in such
cases incessantly makes its appearance, associated with multitudes of
eggs, in the evacuations.The female, which is ordinarily seen alone in the greatest abundance,
is a white cylindrical worm tapering toward both extremities.The head
end is thickened, and is provided with three prominent labial papillae
enclosing the mouth.The posterior end extends from the anal aperture
in a long and straight, narrow, conical, sharp-pointed tail.The double
uterine tube, distended with eggs, terminates in a vagina, the external
aperture of which is situated ventrally near the anterior third of the
body.The smaller male hardly tapers behind, but is incurved and ends
in a short, blunt, conical tail.The penis is a single chitinous
spicule, the end of which is usually seen projecting from the cloacal
aperture.The young seat-worms, in various degrees of growth and development, and
the mature males are chiefly to be met in the lower portion of the
small intestine, while the pregnant and mature females chiefly occupy
the caecum.The seat-worm is exceedingly prolific, it being estimated that a single
ripe female contains from 10,000 to 12,000 eggs, and these, it is
suspected, may be renewed several times before her functions become
exhausted.From time to time the ripe females proceed along the large
intestine to the rectum, in which position they lay most of their eggs.These are discharged, together with many of the worms, in the feces.The eggs are ovoid in shape and about 0.05 mm.After they are
laid under favorable conditions the embryos are rapidly developed.The investigations of the helminthologists of the day make it appear
that it is necessary that the eggs of the seat-worm should be swallowed
{951} and pass through the stomach, in which the embryos are freed,
before they can undergo development to sexual maturity.Moreover,
observations go to show that infection may, and probably ordinarily
does, occur from eggs scratched from the anus and conveyed to the mouth
directly or by being applied to food from uncleanly hands.It is
evident that itching of the anus, induced by the presence of the
parasites in the rectum, often accompanied by itching of the nose and
lips, may lead to alternate scratching of the parts and the
transference of eggs from one to the other.Thus, too, uncleanly nurses
who may be infested with seat-worms after scratching may handle food
and infest children under their charge.Children are commonly more
liable to the parasites than others, no doubt from the circumstance
that they are less capable of avoiding the conditions favorable to
infection.Seat-worms prevail in all conditions of society, but their
prevalence is largely proportioned to the more or less uncleanly
habits.Persons sleeping with others infested are liable to infection,
especially if they are uncleanly and in the habit of eating in bed.Obvious hints to avoid the parasites are obtained by regarding the
statements thus given.SYMPTOMS.--The presence of a few seat-worms is usually attended with no
obvious inconvenience, and they may remain unnoticed unless
accidentally observed in the evacuations.The symptoms occasioned by
them are in great measure proportioned to their quantity and the
susceptibility of the patient.The most prominent symptom is excessive
itching of the anus; often trifling or even absent during the day, it
becomes very annoying and distressing in the evening or during the
night.This periodic change appears to be due to the movement of the
worms to the rectum, apparently induced by the position and repose of
the patient and the increased warmth of the body in bed.Under these
circumstances the patient attempts to relieve the incessant itching by
scratching, and often by boring with the finger in the anus.In this
way eggs become adherent to the finger-nails, under which they have
been repeatedly detected, and may thus be inadvertently transferred to
the mouth.Occasionally, some of the worms wander from the anus, and in
women may thence penetrate into the vulva.The itching of the anus may
induce more or less sexual irritation, which in the young may further
lead to onanism and its attendant evils.Other symptoms of the presence
of the parasites are itching of the nose and lips, restlessness in
sleep, grinding of the teeth, startings, twitchings, and general
nervous disturbance.When the worms are very numerous they may produce
intestinal catarrh, with discharges of mucus, pain, and diarrhoea.In
children especially they may give rise to more serious nervous
symptoms, as epileptic fits and chorea.TREATMENT.--Generally, persons are readily relieved of seat-worms.Epsom salt alone or with senna as a purgative, repeated once or twice,
often answers to completely expel them.Castor oil, also alone or with
a few drops of the oil of turpentine or of wormseed, is also an
effectual remedy.The tincture of aloes, in the dose of from half a
fluidounce to two fluidounces, once or twice repeated, the writer has
found to fully answer the purpose.Besides the purgatives, medicated
suppositories, in obstinate cases injections of olive oil, and enemata
of a solution of castile soap introduced by means of an elastic tube,
so as to wash out the entire length of the large intestine, may be
employed.*       *       *       *       *

{952} ASCARIS LUMBRICOIDES.--SYNONYMS: Round-worm; Long round-worm;
Maw-worm; Lumbricus.The round-worm is the largest of the nematodes which ordinarily infest
man, and is second only in frequency to the seat-worm.It is a
well-known parasite, and prevails everywhere in all conditions of
society.It is less lively in its movements than the seat-worm, and is
remarkable for possessing a peculiar disagreeable odor, which is
independent of the medium in which it lives.It inhabits the small
intestine and feeds on the contents.It also infests the hog and the
ox.The round-worm is cylindrical, reddish or brownish, and tapering toward
both extremities.The head end terminates in three prominent labial
papillae surrounding the mouth, and the tail end is short and conical.The female, as commonly seen, ranges from six inches to a foot in
length, and is about a fourth of an inch in thickness.The ovarian
tubes are long, thread-like, and tortuous, and, with the shorter,
nearly straight, and wider uterine tubes, contain many millions of
eggs.The genital aperture is situated ventrally near the anterior
third of the body.The male is about half the size of the female, but
is capable of considerable extension, and the tail end is incurved.The
penis consists of a pair of slender, clavate, chitinous spicules, the
ends of which protrude from the cloacal aperture at the root of the
tail.The round-worm is exceedingly prolific, it being estimated that the
genital tubes of a large mature female contain the enormous number of
60,000,000 of eggs.The ripe eggs are laid in the intestine, and are
discharged with the evacuations in great numbers, and often in
considerable masses together.They are oval, about 0.05 mm.in length,
and are provided with a thick shell and an additional tuberculate
albuminoid envelope, usually  by the intestinal contents.The eggs of the round-worm after being expelled from the body are very
tenacious of life, and under ordinary favorable circumstances they may
remain in a condition capable of development for several years.Experiments have shown that they have great power in resisting the
destructive influences of heat and cold, dryness, and the agencies of
decomposition.In water and moist earth they have been retained alive
for a year or two.When ripe eggs are placed in water the development
of the embryo is observed to proceed very slowly, and is only completed
after five or six months.The embryo while still contained within the
egg sheds its skin and becomes provided with a tooth-like spine to the
head end.The smallest examples of reputed round-worms found in the
human intestine measured only about a line in length.The further history of the round-worm is unknown, nor has it yet been
positively ascertained in what manner man becomes infected with the
parasite.Repeated experiments, not only on the hog and other animals,
but on man himself, go to show that he is not directly infected by
swallowing the recently-laid ripe eggs.It is rendered probable that
the eggs are swallowed by some common but yet unknown minute aquatic
animal, within which the embryo may undergo further development, and in
this condition may be swallowed by man in drinking-water.In
confirmation of the view that man becomes infected in the latter way,
Davaine remarks that the "people of Paris, who drink only filtered
{953} water, are rarely infected with the round-worm, which is
otherwise the case in the rural districts of France."The round-worm is most prevalent in warm climates, and especially among
the less-civilized peoples.The better classes among the more
enlightened nations suffer comparatively little from the parasite, and
it is the lower classes, especially the ill-fed and uncleanly, who are
most afflicted.It is exceedingly frequent in the Orient, in Africa,
the West Indies, and Brazil.Most commonly, only a few round-worms--one, two, three, up to a
dozen--occur together in the same person, but they often occur in
considerable number, even to several hundreds.Not unfrequently they
are found in association with seat-worms.They are more frequent and
usually occur in greater abundance in children, perhaps in a measure
due to the circumstance that they are less able to discriminate the
conditions favorable to infection and avoided on other grounds by
adults.The natural and ordinary habitation of the round-worm is the small
intestine, especially the jejunum, and it commonly only occurs in the
large intestine, mostly dead, on the way to be discharged with the
evacuations.Under disturbing circumstances, as the character of
certain irritating food, the parasite is disposed to become restless
and wander from its usual position.Not unfrequently it enters the
stomach, and thence may ascend to the mouth or nose, and perhaps the
first intimation of the presence of such an unwelcome guest is in its
expulsion from the mouth.From the pharynx the worm may enter the
larynx and trachea, or advance farther into the air-passages, giving
rise to the usual symptoms of foreign bodies in these parts.Occasionally the parasite forces its way through the bile-ducts into
the liver and gall-bladder, creating disturbance in those organs
proportioned to the number and size of the worms and the extent of
their progress.In the liver it may occasion inflammation and the
formation of an abscess attended with all the usual symptoms of
hepatitis.It has been reported that it may penetrate the intestinal
wall and enter the peritoneal cavity, but it is generally regarded as
doubtful whether the worm can do so in a healthy state of the
intestine, but only where there may be ulceration or other similar
condition.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms indicating the presence of the round-worm in
the intestine vary with its numbers and with the age and susceptibility
of the patient.In general, the presence of one or two worms is
unattended with any marked disturbance, and is mostly unsuspected until
the parasite is accidentally seen in the discharges.The ordinary
symptoms are disordered appetite (usually increased), flatulence,
hiccough, foul breath, dyspepsia, abdominal pains, itching at the
extremities of the alimentary canal, furred tongue, darkening of the
eyelids, and emaciation.The nervous symptoms are restlessness in
sleep, unpleasant dreams, starting in fright, grating of the teeth, and
muscular twitchings.In more aggravated cases, especially in children,
epileptic fits may occur.If the parasites are numerous, they produce
diarrhoea with copious mucus discharges, and may induce enteritis with
all its attendant symptoms.When the worms wander into the stomach,
they induce colic, nausea, retching, and vomiting, all of which
disappear with the expulsion of the parasites.TREATMENT.--The remedies employed for seat-worms often serve to {954}
expel the round-worm, and not unfrequently the two are discharged
together.Wormseed, or the seed of Chenopodium anthelminticum, has been
a favorite remedy for the round-worm, especially in children.The dose
in these cases is one or two scruples of the powdered seeds in
electuary with syrup or molasses, administered in the morning before
breakfast and at bedtime for three or four days.It should be followed
by calomel or other brisk cathartic.The volatile oil, in the dose of
from five to ten drops in emulsion, may be used in the same manner.A much-extolled remedy to destroy and get rid of the round-worm is
santonin, given in doses of from one-third to one and a half grains
three or four times a day, the larger dose being used only for adults.It should be followed by a purgative, for which a dose of castor oil
answers a good purpose.*       *       *       *       *

ASCARIS MYSTAX, the common round-worm of the cat and dog, has been
reported as occasionally infesting man.It resembles the former
species, but is much smaller, commonly from one to four inches in
length, and has the head end furnished with a pair of lateral narrow,
wing-like expansions of the integument.It inhabits the small
intestine, and when present in man would no doubt induce symptoms like
those of the ordinary round-worms which infest him.*       *       *       *       *

TRIOCEPHALUS DISPAR.--SYNONYMS: Long thread-worm; Whip-worm.The long thread-worm is a not unfrequent intestinal parasite of man,
though rarely observed unless specially sought, as it ordinarily gives
rise to little or no disturbance.It is common in England, Southern
Europe, and the Orient.Davaine reports that half the cases of persons
investigated in Paris were infested with it; it also occurs in this
country.It inhabits the lower end of the ileum, the caecum, and
vermiform appendix, and feeds on the intestinal contents.It commonly
occurs in small numbers, two or three to a dozen, occasions no evident
inconvenience, and is rarely discharged with the evacuations.The long thread-worm is yellowish-white and cylindrical, with the
anterior half or more of the body attenuated in a hair-like manner.The
female reaches about two inches in length, has the tail end conical,
and the anus subterminal.The male is about two-thirds the length of
the former, has the thicker portion of the body enrolled, and the tail
end blunt.The eggs are laid in the intestine and discharged with the
feces.The subsequent history of the parasite and its mode of infecting
man remain unknown.Only in cases where long thread-worms are numerous do they give rise to
trouble.According to Leuckart, Pascal gives as constant symptoms of
the presence of large numbers of the parasite, headache, redness of the
face, prominence of the eyes, small, irregular, and intermittent pulse,
and pains in the lower part of the abdomen.The usual remedies addressed to the seat-worm and round-worm will most
probably be equally applicable to the long thread-worm.*       *       *       *       *

LEPTODERA STERCORALIS.--SYNONYMS: Anguillula stercoralis; Rhabditis
stercoralis.{955} This is a minute nematode worm recently observed infesting French
soldiers in Cochin China.It is about half a line in length, and
inhabits the small and large intestine, and also penetrates into the
biliary and pancreatic ducts.It occurs in myriads and occasions
diarrhoea and dysentery.Another species, Leptodera intestinalis,
nearly three times as large, has been noticed in smaller number
associated with the former.The eggs of these worms are laid in the
intestines, and both together are discharged in multitudes with the
feces.They are probably introduced into man by drinking stagnant
water, and undergo complete development after passing through the
stomach.It is probable that the remedies employed in the treatment of the
familiar seat-worms and round-worms would be equally efficacious in the
expulsion of these parasites.*       *       *       *       *

ANCHYLOSTOMUM DUODENALE.--SYNONYMS: Strongylus duodenalis; Dochmius
duodenalis; Sclerostoma duodenale.This intestinal parasite, first noticed in Milan by Dubini in 1838, is
of more dangerous character than any of the nematode worms previously
described.In Europe, besides Italy, it was frequently observed among
the workmen of the St.It is exceedingly common in
Egypt, and Bilharz found it in nearly all his post-mortem examinations
of bodies.It probably prevails to a considerable extent in most
tropical countries, including the East and West Indies and Brazil.There is also reason to suspect, from the nature of the affection it
induces, that it may exist in the Southern States.The Anchylostomum is a red, cylindrical worm, with the anterior
extremity tapering and recurved.The head end, somewhat enlarged,
encloses a capacious oral capsule armed with strong hook-like teeth.The caudal extremity of the female ends in a conical point, and the
genital aperture is situated behind the middle of the body.The caudal
extremity of the male ends in a trilobate pouch, within which projects
the bispiculate penis.The female is from five lines to three-fourths
of an inch long; the male is about half the size.The eggs are oval and
measure 0.05 mm.The worm inhabits the small intestine, especially the duodenum and
jejunum, clinging tenaciously to the lining membrane by means of the
armed mouth.It penetrates the mucous membrane to the submucous coat,
from which it sucks the blood that forms its food.In the position of
its attachment it gives rise to little ecchymoses.It often occurs in
large numbers, even to hundreds and thousands.The eggs are laid in the
intestine and are discharged with the evacuations.Externally, in
water, the embryo undergoes development within the egg, and then
escapes to lead for some time an independent existence.Subsequently,
it is most probable that the worm obtains access to the human stomach
by drinking standing water, and completes its development in the
intestine.The Anchylostomum proves to be a prolific source of wasting diseases in
tropical countries, and is pernicious to an extent proportioned to the
numbers infesting the intestine.By depriving the body of blood it
produces a greater or less degree of anaemia.The affection begins very
insidiously, and the general nutrition of the body may not be visibly
disturbed {956} until a late period.In moderate cases the disease is
indicated by general paleness of the skin and mucous membranes, fatigue
on slight exertion, and a tendency to palpitations and quickened pulse.In more severe cases there is constantly increasing debility, with
increase of paleness, indisposition to exertion, excessive sleepiness,
and feeling of coldness.Dyspeptic symptoms sometimes appear, and loss
of appetite may alternate with ravenous hunger.Accompanying this there
is often a disposition to eat innutritious articles, as coal, clay,
wool, etc.Feeling of weight and oppression in the epigastrium and
abdominal pains are frequent.In the advance of the affection shortness
of breath appears, increased on exertion to violent dyspnoea.Emaciation becomes obvious in the later stage of the disease.In the
worst cases the symptoms increase in severity, the patient becomes
dropsical, is attacked with profuse diarrhoea and vomiting, and finally
dies.The severity of the affection is proportioned to the number of
parasites present and the quantity of blood they consume and cause to
be lost.Bad cases may end fatally in a few weeks, but generally the
disease lasts for months, and where the patient is provided with
abundance of good food it may continue for years.The prognosis of the disease is rather unfavorable; if, however, the
nature of the affection is ascertained before it has greatly exhausted
the patient, and the parasites can be expelled, the result should be
favorable.We have thus far obtained but little information as to the best
treatment for Anchylostomum.Calomel and turpentine have been
recommended, and, as these are most powerful vermicides, we have reason
to believe they would prove most effectual remedies.In regard to the prophylaxis for Anchylostomum--and we may add in
general for all parasites which gain entrance to man through
drinking-water--all stagnant or standing waters should be filtered, so
as to remove any source of infection, whether by eggs or free embryos
of parasites or of larval forms existing within minute aquatic animals
which serve as intermediate hosts to parasites.Standing waters, such
as those of puddles, ditches, marshes, and ponds, more or less swarm
with minute animals, all of which may be entirely removed by
filtration.Even the water of cisterns and wells, if supplied from the
free surface of the country, may not be free from minute animals, and
especially eggs, and therefore requires filtration to be safe.Only
spring and freely-running water of rivers and creeks and of lakes is
commonly free from microscopic animals and their eggs, and therefore
devoid of all danger in these respects.*       *       *       *       *

STRONGYLUS LONGEVAGINATUS; S.bronchialis.--This nematode has been only
once satisfactorily observed.Many occurred in the lungs of a boy in
Germany, but the real cause of his death was not stated.The female
worm is about an inch long, the male about five-eighths of an inch.Certain worms previously discovered in the bronchial glands of a case
of phthisis, and described under the name of Hamularia lymphatica, are
regarded by Cobbold as the same with the former; but the descriptions
of the two render this improbable.Treutler's drawing of Hamularia, as
copied by Leuckart, looks like an Ascaris upside down.*       *       *       *       *

{957} EUSTRONGYLUS GIGAS; Strongylus gigas; Palisade-worm;
Kidney-worm.--This worm, recorded in the catalogue of human parasites,
is doubtful as such.Pertaining to the same family as Anchylostomum, as
the common name indicates its usual habitation is the kidney.It is the
largest of the nematodes, and is a long, cylindrical red worm, slightly
tapering, and blunt at the ends.The mouth is enclosed by six rounded
labial papillae.The caudal extremity of the male ends in an inverted
cup-like pouch, from which the penal spiculum protrudes.The female
commonly ranges from one to three feet in length and from a fourth to
nearly half an inch in thickness.The male ranges from six inches to a
foot in length and from one to three lines in thickness.The mature parasite is common in many fish-eating mammals, from which
it is inferred that fishes are the intermediate host for the juvenile
condition of the worm.It is frequent in the wolf, dog, mink, weasel,
raccoon, otter, and seal.It also occurs in the hog, and is reported to
have occurred in the horse, ox, and man.Usually it is solitary, and
occupies one of the kidneys coiled upon itself.Under its influence the
kidney is atrophied and reduced to the condition of a capsule of
connective tissue, often containing bony spicules.It feeds on blood
and on the purulent matter resulting from the inflammation it produces.The worm is occasionally found in other positions, as the mesentery,
the abdominal cavity, the intestine, liver, urinary bladder, and lungs,
but perhaps in most of these cases has been derived from its usual
habitation.In this country the writer has repeatedly observed the
kidney-worm in the mink, the dog, and the wolf.In one instance in the
former animal he found a female and a male associated together in one
kidney, which was reduced to the condition of a fibrous capsule
containing in its wall a large radiated plate of bone.The cases on record of the occurrence of this formidable parasite in
man are of very early date, and are mostly doubtful as to the authentic
nature of the worm, and are all unsatisfactory as to the attendant
phenomena.*       *       *       *       *

TRICHINA SPIRALIS.--The trichina, or flesh-worm, a minute nematode, is
a common parasite of man, and from its wide prevalence and results may
be regarded as the most dangerous of all.Perhaps from the earliest
ages it has been dealing death freely and indiscriminately to our kind
without its existence having been suspected until within the last
half-century.Frequently, the affection, now named trichinosis,
produced by its presence has been so prevalent in communities as to
appear epidemic.The parasite was first discovered, and is commonly
observed, as a little worm coiled up and imbedded in the flesh of man.In the same manner it is frequently seen in the flesh of the hog.In
the adult or mature state it lives in the small intestine of both man
and the hog, but its duration of life in this position is comparatively
brief.Trichinosis, or the disease induced by the introduction of trichinae
into the intestinal canal and the migration thence into the voluntary
muscles, varies in symptoms and gravity with the number, condition, and
position of the parasites and the susceptibility of the patient.The
presence of trichinae in the alimentary canal, though often accompanied
by violent symptoms, is comparatively free from danger, whereas in the
muscular {958} system they not only produce the greatest suffering, but
often the most disastrous results.Man is ordinarily infected with the trichina by eating the raw or
insufficiently cooked meat of the hog, or pork in any of its varieties
of food.Infected meat often contains immense numbers of the parasite,
a single ounce at times being estimated to contain from 50,000 to
100,000 worms.The trichina was first distinctly noticed in the muscles of the human
body by Paget in 1835, and was described by Owen with the name it now
bears.It was subsequently observed under the same circumstances by
other investigators.In 1846 the parasite was found by the writer in
the muscles of the hog, but neither he nor others for some time
afterward suspected the significance of the discovery.In 1860, Zenker
of Dresden treated a supposed case of typhus complicated with excessive
muscular pain and oedema.On post-mortem examination the muscles were
found swarming with trichinae, and to these the affection altogether
was attributed.Nearly at the same time the investigations of Leuckart
confirmed the relationship of the parasites as the cause of the
disease.In 1862, Friederich first diagnosticated the affection and
experimentally determined the presence of the worms in the living
patient.The trichina is also found infesting other animals of the same class
besides man and the hog, especially the rat, mouse, rabbit, cat, and
fox.Experiments further prove that mammals are generally more or less
susceptible to infection with the parasite, though some appear to
resist its extension to the muscular system, as in the case of the dog.The horse, ox, and sheep exhibit little disposition to artificial
infection of the muscles, and hence from this circumstance and the
nature of the food of these animals they are rarely found to be
infested with trichinae.In experiments on birds and lower classes of
animals, though trichinae were ascertained to advance in development in
the intestine, they failed to invade the muscular system.Ordinarily, it appears that while man is infected with trichinae
through the hog, this animal becomes infected by eating infested rats,
mice, and cats, fragments of waste pork, and perhaps occasionally by
feeding on the excrements of infested animals.The trichinae occupying the muscles are immature, and it is only after
they are swallowed and the parasites are freed by digestion of the
envelopes and pass into the intestine that they undergo development to
sexual maturity.In this state the female is viviparous and gives birth
to a multitude of active embryos, which immediately commence to migrate
to the muscular system.As it is estimated that each female may give
birth to upward of a thousand embryos, it is readily conceived to what
an extent the body may become infested from eating a few ounces of
trichinous pork.The immature or larval trichinae are also distinguished as muscular,
and the sexually mature ones as intestinal, trichinae, in accordance
with their position in the two principal conditions.Muscular trichinae vary in condition from the embryo, which works its
way among the muscular fibres or has obtained entrance into these, to
the coiled-up worm lying quiescent in a capsule imbedded among the
muscular fibres.Infected flesh in the early state is scarcely distinguishable as such
with {959} the naked eye, but in old cases the trichina capsules become
imbued with calcareous matter, and are thus rendered visible as minute
white or grayish specks scattered through the red meat.In the recent state of invasion the worms are found free among the
muscular fibres or within these.Later, they appear mostly solitary and
at rest, coiled within a fusiform mass of semi-liquid granular matter
resulting from the degradation of the muscular substance.Subsequently,
they become enclosed in an elliptical capsule, apparently derived from
the myolemma of the muscular fibre they had entered.The capsules,
situated among the bundles of sound muscular fibres, are arranged with
their long diameter parallel with the latter.The trichina capsules
commonly measure about one-fifth of a line long, and the coiled worm
within is scarcely a half-line long.If muscular trichinae remain with their host, after a year or more they
exhibit signs of decay.Commonly, little fat-globules appear at the
poles of the capsules, and these become the seat of calcareous deposit.Finally, the worms die and undergo degeneration.When meat with living trichina capsules is swallowed, the freed worms
pass into the intestine, and here in the course of four or five days
reach maturity.The adult intestinal trichina is a minute, filiform white worm, thicker
behind and tapering forward.The female is about an eighth of an inch
long, and has the genital aperture at the anterior fourth of the body.The male is little more than half the length of the former, and has the
caudal end provided with a pair of conical processes, between which is
the genital aperture.The ripe female trichinae give birth to living embryos, and continue
the function for about a month, after which they appear exhausted,
ordinarily die, and disappear from the intestinal canal.The new-born
embryos, about 1/200 of a line long, quickly leave the intestine to be
disseminated throughout the body.Penetrating the mucous membrane, they
probably enter the blood-vessels to be carried onward by the
blood-currents, and perhaps also, in part, directly migrate to their
destination in the muscles.The latter mode of progress is rendered the
more probable from the circumstance that the muscles contiguous to the
intestinal canal, as the diaphragm and those of the abdominal walls,
are commonly most abundantly infested with the parasites.In the
muscles of the limbs they are sometimes noticed to predominate toward
the extremities of the former, as if retarded in their course by the
tendinous connections.It would appear that muscular trichinae, to be capable of producing
infection--that is to say, of further development--must have reached a
certain stage, corresponding with the encapsulated condition, before
they are swallowed.In this stage they may remain within their host
probably for a year or two.Children seem to suffer less in proportion to the quantity of
trichinous meat they eat than adults, and they appear less susceptible
to muscular invasion of the parasites.The difference is probably in a
measure due to the greater susceptibility of the intestinal canal and
the consequent production of more copious diarrhoea in children, with
more complete expulsion of the worms.SYMPTOMS.--In general, the effect produced by eating trichinous meat
{960} is proportioned to the number and condition of the trichinae
ingested and to the susceptibility of the patient.A few of the
parasites may pursue their entire career and die within their host
without ever exhibiting any obvious evidence of their presence.Sometimes the symptoms of trichinosis are obscure or trifling,
sometimes sufficiently well marked, but moderate, and often they are
more or less striking and violent.The period of incubation of the
affection varies from a few hours to a week or more, and the duration
of the disease also varies--both in a measure proportioned to the
number and condition of the parasites.In mild cases of trichinosis the patient may pass through the course of
the disease without being confined to bed, and in a few weeks may be
regarded as convalescent.The majority of cases pursue a slow course of
from six or seven weeks to three or four months.A fatal termination is
frequent, and is most common from the fourth to the sixth week, and
appears mainly to be due to the loss of respiratory power.Fatal cases
rarely happen after the seventh week.From a few hours to a few days after eating trichinous meat the patient
may be seized with dyspeptic symptoms--nausea, cardialgia, flatulence,
eructations, and vomiting.These may be accompanied with complete loss
of appetite, excessive thirst, bad taste, and fetid breath.There is
also commonly a feeling of general uneasiness, with fulness of the
forehead or headache, and feeling of weakness and fatigue to exhaustion
or complete prostration.Neuralgic pains are felt in the abdomen and
limbs, and the muscles generally are more or less relaxed and flabby.Violent disturbance of the alimentary canal occurs only when large
quantities of active trichinae are taken with the food.The subsequent
symptoms, due to invasion of the muscular system, may, but do not
necessarily, accord in degree with the former.Diarrhoea usually comes on early, and the evacuations, at first more
consistent, become thin and clay-, like those of typhus or like
the rice-water stools of cholera.In the severest cases the patient may
die in this stage from extreme exhaustion and with all the appearance
of cholera.Sometimes the diarrhoea subsides and gives place to
obstinate constipation.The muscular symptoms induced by the invasion of the trichinae may be
trifling or moderate, varying to a most violent character.They
commonly appear after a week, and later up to the sixth week.The
muscles become more or less swollen, hard and tender to the touch, or
highly painful under pressure.Motion is extremely painful, and the
patient usually lies in a helpless state with the limbs flexed--adults
on the back, children on the side.Difficulty, with pain, in chewing
and swallowing ensues, and even complete trismus, due to the presence
of the parasites in the muscles of mastication and deglutition.Difficulty of breathing also arises from the presence of the trichinae
in the respiratory muscles, especially the diaphragm and those of the
larynx.Even movement of the eyes is painful, due to the parasites in
the orbital muscles.Bronchial catarrh comes on early, attended with
hoarseness and asthmatic cough.Fever may be absent in mild cases of trichinosis, but is considerable
in the severer forms, though not in the first few days.The pulse
accords with the increase of temperature.Profuse sweating is a common symptom of the affection, commencing {961}
early and continuing throughout.Generally there is considerable
decrease in the quantity of urine, which is highly <DW52>.Adults suffer with insomnia, while the reverse state prevails in
children, who commonly lie in a soporose condition.Formication and
dilatation of the pupils are frequent symptoms.Oedema is a characteristic and pathognomonic symptom of trichinosis,
and is seldom so slight as to escape attention.It commonly appears in
the eyelids and face about the end of the first week, and may disappear
after several days, to recur after several weeks.It usually commences
in the limbs in the second week, and is more marked and persistent, and
increases, especially in severe cases.Peritoneal and pleuritic irritation and inflammation, with bronchitis
and pneumonia, are not unfrequent complications in the more aggravated
form of trichinosis.Most cases of the disease reaching the seventh week advance in
convalescence, while those of mild character by this time have
recovered, except from the weakness and emaciation, which remain as
evidences of serious illness.Trichinosis in children is distinguished by greater mildness, less
danger, abundant oedema, less muscular pain, a dormant condition, and
more rapid convalescence.The distinct recognition of trichinosis is difficult in isolated cases,
but becomes more evident where it occurs in numbers, as in an entire
family or in large portions of a community.The proof that the patient
has partaken of trichinous pork helps to establish the diagnosis.In the beginning of severe cases of the affection symptoms of a more or
less violent gastro-intestinal catarrh are commonly present, often
associated with slight fever and almost invariably excessive
perspiration.Muscular lameness, both in mild and severe cases, is an
early symptom.The disease is distinguished from cholera by the profuse
perspiration and the peculiar muscular symptoms; from ordinary
rheumatism by the gastro-intestinal catarrh and general exhaustion.With the appearance of oedema of the eyelids and face at the end of a
week the diagnosis becomes more certain.The further progress of the
affection is so characteristic that its distinction can scarcely remain
in doubt.The general prostration, the violent muscular symptoms, the
bronchial catarrh, the hoarseness and dyspnoea, the profuse sweating,
and the sleeplessness, render the case pretty clear.In the prognosis of the disease no positive conclusion can be derived
from the severity or early appearance of the initial symptoms.Commonly, the more speedily they occur and the more violent they are,
the less favorable will be the prognosis, while the later they appear,
the more propitious it is.Long-continued diarrhoea is especially
unfavorable, while a profuse diarrhoea at the beginning is to be viewed
as a fortunate event.The prognosis is more favorable in cases in which
sleep and the appetite are maintained, and in those in which the
disturbance of the respiratory organs is slight.A favorable
termination of the affection is the rule with children.TREATMENT.--The treatment of trichinosis is not generally promising in
favorable results.No means have yet been discovered to destroy or
remove trichinae which have migrated from the intestinal canal.While
{962} the parasites continue within the latter we may have reasonable
hope of expelling them from the body by means of the usual remedies for
intestinal worms.Experience, however, with these remedies has not been
in accordance with expectations.In the mean time, until some more
potent vermicide is discovered applicable to the destruction and
removal of trichinae from the intestine, we are disposed to place most
reliance on such purgatives as oil of turpentine and castor oil and
calomel and jalap.Subsequently, a good nutritive diet with wine is
recommended to preserve the life of the patient until the affection has
reached that period when the parasites become capsulated and there is
no longer danger from them as irritants.As a preventive of trichinosis, besides the avoidance of pork or its
varied preparations of ham, sausages, etc.when it is known or
suspected they may be infested, thorough cooking of meats is a certain
means.A boiling temperature surely kills all animal parasites, but
care is requisite that large pieces of meat should be cooked
sufficiently long that the desired heat may extend to the interior
throughout.The writer may add that it was in a slice of boiled ham,
from which he had partly made his dinner, that he first discovered
trichina in the hog.*       *       *       *       *

Of the nematode worms there are many species of comparatively long,
slender proportions, which constitute the family of Filaridae.As
parasites they rarely occupy the interior of the intestinal canal,
except by way of transit, and live in most other organs and tissues of
the body of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA MEDINENSIS.--SYNONYMS: Dracunculus; D. medinensis; Medina-worm;
Guinea-worm.The Medina-worm has long been recognized as a parasite of man, and by
competent authorities has been regarded as the fiery serpent which
afflicted the children of Israel in the wilderness of Judea.It
prevails in the tropical regions of Africa and Asia, and thence has
been introduced into tropical America.It is ordinarily observed as a
long, white, cord-like worm, situated beneath the skin in any part of
the body, but mostly in the lower limbs, and especially in the vicinity
of the ankle.Though a frequent parasite, only the female is known.In
the mature condition it is nearly uniformly cylindrical, and ranges
from eighteen inches to three or four feet in length and less than a
line in thickness.The head end is rounded and furnished with a little
papillate plate, in the centre of which is situated a minute oral
aperture.The caudal end is conical and incurved.The intestinal canal
is atrophied and without an anal aperture.The coelum is mainly
occupied by a capacious uterus filled with free embryos.A generative
aperture appears also to be absent, and the young can only escape by
rupture of the parent.Experiments made about a dozen years since in Turkestan by Fedschenko,
at the suggestion of Leuckart, have shown that when the embryos of the
Medina-worm are introduced into water containing the familiar little
crustacean cyclops, they penetrate into this, and within it undergo
transformation into the larval stage.The subsequent history of the
larval worms remains unknown, but from what we have learned of the
history of many parasitic worms it is reasonable to suppose that if
{963} the infested cyclops is swallowed in drinking-water, it may
explain the presence of the mature worm in the human body.The young
worms, liberated from their crustacean host by digestion in the
stomach, probably enter the intestine, and thence migrate to their
destination.In the young condition, advancing to maturity, the worms
have been found in all parts of the body except within the cranium and
eyeball.They appear to migrate in the course of the least-resisting
connective tissues, along the route of the principal blood-vessels,
until they reach the surface of the body.Usually, a single worm is found in a person, though cases occur where
several, to a dozen or more, are present.Commonly, the parasite is
solitary, though two or three may be associated together.When deeply
seated the Medina-worm ordinarily produces but little discomfort,
though in some cases its movements are accompanied with more or less
severe pain.It also gives rise to inflammation and the formation of an
abscess, in the purulent matter of which the worm lies bathed.The
removal of the worm, when accessible, by the proper surgical aid is
followed by complete relief.It is evident that filtration of the drinking-water would be a certain
prophylaxis for the Medina-worm.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA SANGUINIS.--SYNONYMS: Filaria sanguinis hominis, Lewis; F.
sanguinolenta; F. Bancrofti, Cobbold.Another species of Filaria, a more dangerous parasite of man and
indigenous to the tropics, is of frequent occurrence, though of
comparatively recent discovery.It has been observed in India, Africa,
Brazil, and the West Indies.It is commonly seen in the embryonic
condition, living in the blood of patients affected with elephantiasis
and certain other diseases, and is also found in the urine.In this
early condition it is a minute worm, scarcely more than the 1/100 of an
inch in length, and occurs together in immense numbers.In the sexually mature condition the female filaria is a white
hair-like worm three or four inches in length, living in the lymphatic
vessels distally to the glands, especially in those of the lower limbs
and scrotum.The embryos after leaving the parent pass into the
lymphatic stream, and thence into the circulating blood.According to
recent observations of Manson, they enter the blood in the evening and
increase in number until midnight, after which they decrease and
disappear by morning, from which time during the day they remain absent
from the circulation.The investigations of the same authority have
shown that when the blood of infected persons is sucked by mosquitoes
these insects also imbibe the embryos, which subsequently undergo
transformation in the mosquitoes into the larval state.In this
condition the filariae may be transferred to water, by drinking which
man may become infected with the parasites.The larvae introduced into
the stomach appear thence to make their way to the lymphatics, within
which they undergo further development to maturity, and thus remain a
long time.The presence of the worms in the lymphatics, with their numerous brood
in the circulating blood, gives rise to haematuria and chyluria.As
results of the obstruction of the lymphatic currents, the parasites
induce inflammation, suppuration, lymphatic abscesses, buboes,
lymphangiectasis, {964} oedema, ascites, chylous hydrocele,
elephantiasis,[3] and certain cutaneous affections.[Footnote 3: Several years since, with the view of ascertaining the
presence of parasitic worms, the writer examined the blood of a case of
elephantiasis under the charge of T. G. Morton, but none were detected.From what we have since been informed of the habits of Filaria
sanguinis, the absence of the parasites may have its explanation in the
circumstance that the blood examined was withdrawn in the daytime.]TREATMENT.--While the treatment of the affection induced by the Filaria
sanguinis is varied and uncertain, the prophylactic measures are
obvious and certain.Under favorable conditions of bright light, high
temperature, and abundant food the stagnant waters of tropical
countries are especially prolific of the minute forms of animals which
harbor parasites.It hence becomes evident that all such waters,
whether obtained from puddles, ponds, tanks, or cisterns, should be
filtered before being used for drinking.Boiling is also effectual in
destroying all the animal life of waters, and thus rendering them
innocuous so far as parasites are concerned.*       *       *       *       *

Several other species of Filaria have been found in the human body, but
are little known and very rare in their occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA LOA.--This species occurs in Western Africa, on the Gaboon
River, and is perhaps more frequent than now commonly supposed.It is
an active worm, little more than an inch in length, and is usually
found beneath the conjunctiva of the eye.It probably also occupies
other positions, and a missionary on the Gaboon informed the writer
that he had extracted one from the back of one of his own fingers.Its
presence produced an intense burning pain.The <DW64>s are reported to
extract the worm by means of a thorn.The worm has also been observed
in Brazil and the West Indies.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA RESTIFORMIS.--Under this name the writer recently described a
large Filaria reported to have been withdrawn from the urethra of a man
in West Virginia.It was obtained by C. L. Garnett, and sent, together
with an account of the case, to the Army Medical Museum of Washington,
where it is now preserved.It was a red cylindrical worm, twenty-six
inches in length, tapering at the head, and thick, incurved, and
obtusely rounded at the tail end.[4]

occurrence of little worms in the aqueous humor and crystalline lens of
the human eye, to which the accompanying names have been applied.*       *       *       *       *

DISEASES OF THE LIVER.BY ROBERTS BARTHOLOW, A.M., M.D., LL.D.I. FUNCTIONAL DISORDERS.DEFINITION.--The term biliousness is used to signify a disturbance of
the gastro-intestinal digestion, with coincident excess in the
production of bile.According to the popular conception, both lay and
medical, the excess of bile is the cause of the symptoms; but when the
whole subject is carefully examined it will be found that biliousness
is made up of several factors, and that the hepatic disorder, if it
exist at all, is a mere incident.PATHOGENY.--From the time of Galen biliousness has been regarded as a
morbid entity and the liver as the organ affected.Stoll, amongst
moderns, first revived the Galenical doctrines.Abernethy[1] was
amongst English physicians the most conspicuous advocate of the
condition called biliousness, and was the apostle of blue pill and
black draught.Copland in his great dictionary[2] more distinctly
formulated the views of the English school--especially that portion of
it influenced by the results of Indian practice--than had been
previously attempted, and hence his work best represents the opinions
and practice of the time amongst the English-speaking peoples.In this
country the great Rush first promulgated the notions of biliousness
which have since so dominated the medical opinion of this continent.A
large part of the United States has proved a fruitful soil for the
cultivation of theories of biliousness, since the condition known under
this name is a frequent accompaniment of malarial poisoning.To this
fact must be attributed the preponderating importance of biliary
derangements in the practice of the physicians of India also.[Footnote 1: _Surgical Works_, London, 1811, vol.[Footnote 2: _A Dictionary of Practical Medicine_, vol.It is a fact which will be hereafter more fully developed that malarial
infection may, and often does, derange the hepatic functions without
producing fever.The malarial poison irritates the liver, and thus more
bile is produced, but the quality deteriorates with the increase in
quantity.The functions of the liver are more disturbed during an
access of intermittent fever: the organ is swollen, the skin is muddy,
the eyes yellow, the tongue coated with a thick yellow fur, and the
urine is deeply tinged with bile-pigment.Many of the metals employed as medicines and as poisons, as gold, {966}
silver, antimony, arsenic, phosphorus, etc., irritate the liver both in
their entrance and in their exit from the organism, and cause
biliousness; and the same fact is true of some vegetable alkaloids and
animal poisons.The liver excretes many of these substances, and in
their passage out from the blood the hepatic cells are irritated and an
increased production of bile is a result.Improper food, indulgence in
fats, sweets, condiments, and all kinds of fermented and alcoholic
liquors, intestinal indigestion arising from any cause, and
gastro-duodenal catarrh, are the most usual and obvious pathogenic
factors.In respect to food and indigestion as etiological factors
there are several points requiring more explicit statement.When
nitrogenous elements (albuminoids) are in excess in quantity or as
respects the power to digest and convert them, immature products, of
which uric acid is the chief, accumulate in the blood.When the fats,
sugars, and starches are in excess of the requirements of the organism
or are imperfectly disposed of in the small intestines, a local
irritation of the mucous membrane is produced, and various complicated,
immature products enter the blood.With these troubles and faults of
intestinal digestion a gastro-duodenal catarrh is usually associated.Without the production of catarrhal jaundice, gastro-duodenal catarrh,
with the forms of indigestion accompanying it, keeps up a reflex
irritation of the liver.Just as the presence of normal chyme induces
the flow of bile, so the unhealthy products of intestinal indigestion
excite an irritation of the liver.The continued operation of this
cause maintains an abnormal activity of the liver, and more bile is
produced than is easily disposed of.SYMPTOMS.--The condition of biliousness, as now understood, is made up
of derangement of the gastro-duodenal mucous membrane, with
bile-production in excess and bile-absorption probably delayed.The
symptoms are the product of these complicated conditions.The
complexion is muddy; the conjunctivae are yellow; the tongue is heavily
coated with a yellowish-white fur; a bitter taste persists in the
mouth; the breath is heavy in odor, even fetid; the appetite may be
keen or there may be complete anorexia; a sensation of nausea, of
heaviness, and fulness of the stomach is experienced, especially after
eating; the bowels are confined usually, but occasionally the movements
are relaxed, bilious in appearance, and cause heat and irritation about
the anus; headache is constantly present to some extent, and there is a
sense of fulness with more or less dizziness, and singing in the ears;
vision is rather blurred, and there is a hebetude of mind; the urine is
high-, high in specific gravity, and deposits lithates
abundantly on cooling.When these symptoms are conjoined with
hemicrania, nausea, and vomiting, the case is called bilious sick
headache, and when diarrhoea supervenes, the discharges apparently
containing much bile, it is bilious diarrhoea.The symptoms which above
all others give the character to the morbid complexus are the muddy
(bilious) complexion, the yellow-coated tongue, the yellow
conjunctivae, and the high- urine.The first departure from the
normal may be scarcely observed.Gradually, owing chiefly to errors of
diet, to climatic changes, or to malarial influences, or to these
several factors combined, the affected person drifts into the condition
of biliousness above described.Besides the general malaise, he
experiences no little despondency, inaptitude for exertion, and indeed
actual weakness.Finally, he is unable to apply himself to business,
relinquishes the effort, and seeks advice.{967} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Those who are accustomed to
experience attacks of biliousness suffer from them at certain intervals
which may be tolerably regular--at intervals of a few days, two, three,
or four weeks--when the cause is uniform; but they may happen very
irregularly when the conditions producing them are variable.The
duration of an attack is from two days to a week or more, according to
the severity of the symptoms and to the character of the measures
instituted for relief.The termination is in a return to the normal
state.If the conditions which produced it continue, when one attack is
ended the preparations for another begin at once, and at length
sufficient derangement of the organs concerned arises to constitute the
morbid complexus of biliousness.TREATMENT.--Prophylaxis has great importance, since the causes of the
malady are to a considerable extent, at least, preventable.Errors of
diet in respect to the use of condiments, fats, meat, pastry, etc.When there is pronounced gastro-duodenal catarrh and acid
fermentation in the duodenum, the saccharine, fatty, and starchy
elements of the food must rather be excluded and lean meats allowed.Abundant exercise, bathing, and an open-air life in general should be
directed.Whenever a malarial infection is causative a change of
climate becomes imperative.Heredity cannot, of course, be excluded,
but the tendency to hepatic derangement can be rendered inoperative by
an abstemious life.The remedial management includes the dietetic as well as the medicinal
treatment.When the distress has reached sufficient proportions to
justify such an extreme measure, the patient should be restricted to a
diet exclusively of skimmed milk, of which he is directed to take a
gill or more every three hours.This serves a double purpose, as
aliment and as a depurative agent, for this considerable quantity of
fluid promotes the urinary excretion and the elimination of waste
products.If the case is not severe enough to allow of such an
expedient, the diet should in any event be restricted to skimmed milk
hot, milk and hot water, hot lemonade, a little chicken or mutton
broth, a bit of dry toast, etc.As a rule, although not so palatable,
hot drinks are more beneficial than cold, but if the preference is
decidedly for cold, they may be allowed.After the more severe symptoms
have subsided a little lean meat broiled may be added, and as the cure
proceeds the succulent vegetables and acid fruits may be permitted.Abstinence from potatoes, hominy, cracked wheat, and oatmeal should be
enjoined during the convalescence of those who suffer from habitual
attacks.Medicines may not be necessary to those who have the resolution to
adhere to skimmed milk for several days or who can abstain from food
altogether for a day.Many experienced sufferers, especially through
the South and West and in England, procure rather prompt relief from a
blue pill of ten to fifteen grains or from one to five grains of
calomel at night, followed by a Seidlitz powder, Rochelle or Epsom
salts, or phosphate of soda on the following morning.Such patients
find that no other treatment is as serviceable.They get relief from
other measures, it is true, but neither as promptly nor as
satisfactorily.It is held by the advocates of this practice that the
mercurial acts on the liver--that the surplus bile is carried off; and
they point to the peculiar stools and to {968} the relief experienced
in evidence of the truth of this theory.Without entering on the
argument, which would occupy too much space, it must suffice here to
state that calomel and blue pill do not increase bile-production,[3]
but they do stimulate the intestinal glands and increase excretion from
them.The peculiar greenish stools produced by these mercurials do not
owe their characteristic appearance to the presence of bile, but rather
to the chemical transformations of the mercury itself and to the waste
products excreted by the intestinal glands.Since the researches of
Rutherford have been published, euonymin has been much prescribed in
cases of biliousness.From three to five grains are taken at the
bed-hour, and a mild laxative in the morning.In the same group of
cholagogues are ipecac, iridin, sanguinarin, and especially
podophyllin; but the serious objection to their use is that they
stimulate the liver when this organ is in an irritable state.As
calomel and blue pill have a sedative rather than a stimulant action on
the liver, they are more useful in biliousness than are the true
cholagogues.It should be borne in mind that one-half of a grain of
calomel will have a distinct purgative action on many persons, and that
one grain will rarely need to be exceeded.[Footnote 3: That calomel, the type of a mercurial purgative, does not
increase the discharge of bile has been demonstrated on dogs by Rohrig
and Rutherford, and confirmed by observation of the effects of 20
grains on Westphalen's case of biliary fistula in man--a case in which,
for a time, all the bile escaped externally, and none apparently
entered the intestine (_Deutsch.Med._, 1873, Band xi.In general, notwithstanding the unquestionable utility of the
mercurial, it is better to relieve cases of biliousness by less
objectionable measures.A saline which acts at the same time on the
intestines and kidneys, as Rochelle salts, is usually effective in
bringing relief.A bottle of solution of magnesia citrate, of Saratoga
water (Congress, Hathorn, or High Rock), and of Blue Lick, the famous
sulphurous laxative of Kentucky, may remove the disorder in mild cases
if at the same time a suitable diet is enjoined.Phosphate of soda in
laxative doses, with or without Vichy water, is also a good remedy, if
somewhat slow.The warm purgatives, rhubarb, colocynth, aloes, etc.,
are useful when there is pronounced constipation.DEFINITION.--By the term lithaemia is meant a condition of the system
in which uric (lithic) acid is produced in excess, and in which certain
derangements occur in consequence of the accumulation of this material
in the blood.Uricaemia was the term first suggested by Flint, Sr.,[4]
to express this state, and subsequently lithaemia was employed by
Murchison.[5] The latter has been more generally accepted.In one of
the most recent and valuable contributions to this subject by
DaCosta[6] lithaemia is the term used to designate the complex of
symptoms produced by uric acid in excess.[Footnote 4: _The Principles and Practice of Medicine_, Philada.,
1882.][Footnote 5: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, 2d ed., p.[Footnote 6: _The Medical News_, vol.PATHOGENY.--The ultimate product of albuminoid substances in the
organism prepared for final excretion is urea.That this substance is
{969} finally formed in the liver, to be excreted by the kidneys, seems
now well established.[7] In acute yellow atrophy of the liver, with the
disappearance of the proper structure of the organs urea ceases to be
produced, and instead leucin and tyrosin are excreted.In certain
states of the system characterized by deficient oxidation urea is not
sufficiently formed, and instead uric acid, a lower grade of oxidation
and a product of the disintegration of albuminoid substances, results.An excess of urates is not always pathological.Their excretion seems
to be in a certain sense a safety-valve function.When albuminoid
matters are taken in excess of the power of the system to convert them,
or when the supply of oxygen to the blood is deficient from any cause,
urea is not formed, but uric acid and urates are abundantly excreted by
the urine.[8] Imperfect digestion of the albuminoids when they are not
taken in relatively too large an amount, and limitation below the
normal of the oxidation process when the supply of oxygen is not
insufficient, will have the same effect: in place of urea, uric acid
and urates will be formed and excreted.One of the early results of the
persistent presence of an excess of uric acid is the production of
lithaemia, the morbid complexus of which this excess is at once the
cause and the proof.[Footnote 7: This proposition is not universally accepted.Valmont
(These de Paris, _Etude sur les Causes des Variations de l'Uree dans
quelques Maladies du Foie_, 1879) has carefully studied the excretion
of urea in several diseases in which the proper structure of the liver
is damaged--in atrophic cirrhosis and in cancer.As in these maladies
not all the secreting portion of the organ is destroyed, the argument
is so far weakened.Patients with
cirrhosis or cancer of the liver who eat little excrete but little
urea.If they eat and do not absorb, or vomit or have diarrhoea, the
result is the same.When they partake largely of nitrogenous aliment
the proportion of urea rapidly increases.In a cachectic or simply
anaemic patient the urea falls, apparently in proportion to the state
of the general nutrition and of the work done by the organic functions.Absolute immobility of the patient seems to have an influence on the
amount of urea excreted.In sclerosis or cancer the quantity of urea
falls rapidly on the occurrence of ascites or oedema, when a notable
quantity of urea is found in the fluid.The digitalis often used in
the treatment also contributed to the loss of urea."If these
conclusions are verified, the formation of urea must depend on some
other function.][Footnote 8: Genevoix, _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree et de
l'Acide urique dans les Maladies du Foie_, Paris, 1876.]The persons who suffer from lithaemia are usually those who indulge in
the pleasures of the table and habitually consume much meat, pastry,
and highly-seasoned and rich food of all kinds.The idle, luxurious,
and indolent, literary men of sedentary habits, men who have led active
lives, but on retiring from business have continued to indulge in a
full diet, are apt to suffer from this malady.Women are less disposed
to it, but if subjected to the same conditions may also be similarly
affected.Especially do those suffer from lithaemia who indulge in malt
liquors or in alcoholic drinks of any kind.These substances act by
deranging digestion, and thus preventing the proper conversion of the
albuminoids, by inducing congestion of the liver, and also by
interfering with the process of oxidation.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of lithaemia include derangements of the
digestive organs and of the liver, of the circulation, and of the
nervous system.As these subjects suffer from gastric and
gastro-duodenal catarrh, they present the usual symptomatology of these
affections, as a sense of weight and oppression at the epigastrium,
acidity, pyrosis, a capricious--sometimes voracious, sometimes
good--appetite, a coated {970} tongue, a bitter taste, etc.The bowels
are irregular, sometimes constipated, occasionally relaxed, with
scybalae.The stools may be liquid, almost black or light-yellow and
grayish.The motions are apt to be offensive, and a good deal of
offensive gas is discharged with them.Hemorrhoids are often present,
and there may be heat and irritation about the anus, and not
unfrequently intolerable itching.After meals there is much depression,
and often an insupportable drowsiness.Irregularity in the rhythm, even
intermissions, of the pulse are not infrequent.The nervous symptoms, as DaCosta has lately insisted on, are the most
important and pronounced.The connection between oxaluria and mental
despondency has long been known, but the nature of the relation remains
undetermined.Headache, frontal and occipital, especially the former,
dizziness, tinnitus aurium, suffusion of the eyes, ecchymoses of the
conjunctiva, are usually present.Not unfrequently the subjects of this
affection experience sudden attacks of vertigo, accompanied by dimness
of vision and intense headache, and are supposed to have some organic
lesion of the brain.They are irritable, despondent, and often
intensely hypochondriacal, almost suicidal--are subject to neuralgic
attacks, and have aching in the limbs, a sense of weariness, and more
or less burning in the palms and soles.The skin is rather dry and the complexion muddy.Urticaria is of
frequent occurrence, and sudden attacks of nausea, vomiting, and
intestinal pain coincide with the appearance of the eruption on the
skin.The urine is usually rather increased in amount, its color heightened,
its acidity above normal, and floating in it, usually visible to the
naked eye, are reddish masses composed of uric acid.More or less pain
in the back, referable to the situation of the kidneys, and sometimes
extending along the course of the ureters, is common.The bladder is
rather irritable, and the passage of the urine produces heat and
scalding.The testicles are apt to feel sore and are somewhat
retracted.On standing, the urine may deposit uric acid and the urates
copiously, or the acid may be seen to form a cloud which slowly
subsides.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course and duration of
lithaemia are much influenced by the habits of life of the person
affected.When unopposed by treatment and no change is made in the
conditions producing it, a gradual increase in the various disturbances
takes place.After a time structural changes occur in the liver; the
organs of circulation early undergo atheromatous degeneration; various
cerebral disorders due to degenerative changes arise; and acute
intercurrent affections may terminate life.Amongst the secondary
maladies due to lithaemia are gout, diabetes, renal calculi, and
nephritic colic.If the cases are subjected to appropriate treatment,
curative results may be certainly obtained.The prognosis, then, will
be influenced materially by the moral strength of the patient.If he is
one who can surrender his appetites and live abstemiously, a cure may
be promised.The case is far different with those who will continue the
use of malt, vinous, or alcoholic drinks, and will persist in indulging
in the pleasures of the table.DIAGNOSIS.--The differentiation of lithaemia from other affections
offers no special difficulties.From gastro-duodenal catarrh it is
separated by the {971} excess of uric acid in the urine only, the other
symptoms being for the most part the same.The cerebral symptoms--the
vertigo, headache, etc.--are to be distinguished from the same due to
actual disease of the brain by the previous history, by the absence of
changes seen on ophthalmoscopic examination and of other signs of brain
disease, and by the subsequent behavior.Cases of cerebral mischief
producing such effects would rapidly develop into serious states,
whereas in lithaemia there are great fluctuations, but no apparent
progress in many months.In lithaemia also there are no changes in the
fundus oculi, whereas in brain diseases choked disk, hemorrhage into
the retina, white atrophy, etc.Further, in
lithaemia there are no disorders of sensibility, of motility, or of
intellection, whilst these are ordinary evidences of cerebral mischief.TREATMENT.--Attention to diet is of the first importance.As uric acid
is an intermediate product in the metamorphosis of albumen, it might be
supposed that to diminish the quantity of this constituent of the food
would be sufficient.In some cases this suffices, but usually attention
must be given to the peculiarities of digestion characteristic of each
patient.More frequently trouble arises from indulgence in the starchy
and saccharine constituents of the diet; in some a very considerable
gastro-duodenal catarrh exists, and the mucus, acting as a ferment,
sets up an acetic fermentation in the starchy and saccharine
substances, with the necessary production of much carbonic acid gas.If
the fats disagree, the butyric fermentation also takes place, and very
irritating fat acids result.In these cases there is usually much gas
formed in the stomach and intestine, and an immediate ratio appears to
exist between the degree of mental despondency and the quantity of gas
in the intestinal canal.It follows, then, that in cases of lithaemia
the saccharine, starchy, and fatty constituents of an ordinary diet
should be omitted from the food of such subjects.Bread should be
partaken of very sparingly, and the foods containing starch, sugar, and
oil ought not to be partaken of at all.The succulent vegetables, as
lettuce, spinach, celery, cole-slaw, tomatoes, etc., ought to be
substituted.Lean fresh meats, poultry, game (plainly cooked), fresh
fish, oysters, eggs, etc.On
the other hand, there may be those who do better on a diet of
vegetables and fruit, excluding meat.In such we may suppose the fault
lies in the stomach digestion, where the albuminoids are converted into
peptones, the intestinal digestion being active and normal.All kinds
of wine and malt liquors should be prohibited.Coffee and tea must also
be relinquished.Without the carefully-regulated diet medicines can
accomplish but little; hence he who would obtain curative results must
give careful attention to every dietetic detail.As deficient oxidation is an important factor in developing lithaemia,
active exercise must be enjoined.The amount of exercise must be
determined by the condition of the individual and the time, regulated
as far as may be by the period after meals.As when the food prepared
for assimilation is entering the circulation oxygen is needed to
perfect the final changes, it seems clear that exercise should be taken
three or four hours after the process of digestion has begun.Walking
exercise is better than any other for this purpose, but it should not
be carried to the point of exhaustion from fatigue.Sea-air and
sea-bathing are oxidizing agents of considerable value, and are
especially useful to the {972} subjects of lithaemia suffering at the
same time from malarial infection.Medicines are administered with the view to accomplish two purposes: to
correct the disorders of digestion, to promote oxidation.One of the
most useful remedies is nitric acid, five to ten minims of the official
diluted acid being given before meals.It is more especially effective
when there is an excessive production of acid.The fermentation which
produces acid and the diffusion of acid-forming materials from the
blood are alike prevented by it.The injunction to administer it before
meals must be borne in mind when these purposes are to be subserved.Nitric acid, as well as the other mineral acids, but in a greater
degree, promotes the flow of bile.This well-known clinical fact has
been confirmed by experiments.Under the use of nitric acid, as above
advised, uric acid and the urates disappear from the urine, being
excreted as urea, and hence this remedy accomplishes both of the
objects for which medicines are administered in this disorder.No other
mineral acid can fill its place in this connection.Alkalies possess very decidedly the power to promote oxidation.The
soda salts are objectionable, for, combining with uric acid, they form
the insoluble urate of soda.The salts of potash and lithium, on the
other hand, form soluble combinations, and they also increase
elimination.Much depends on the time at which they are administered,
as Bence Jones,[9] and since Ralfe[10] especially, has shown.To
increase the alkalinity of the blood and urine, they must be taken
after meals, for then the acid materials of digestion are pouring into
the blood.For the same reason, if alkalies are administered to
neutralize the acidity of the intestinal canal, they must be given
after meals.The most useful alkaline remedies are liquor potassae,
bicarbonate of potash, Rochelle salts, citrate of lithium, etc.The
effervescing preparations of potash and of lithium are elegant and
palatable forms in which to administer these remedies.They may also be
taken dissolved in Vichy water, in our Saratoga Vichy, or in Carlsbad
or Bethesda.When the use of mineral waters is not contraindicated in
the state of the digestive organs, great good is accomplished by the
persistent use of Vichy, foreign or domestic, of Carlsbad, and the
alkaline waters of Wisconsin.[Footnote 9: _Lectures on Pathology and Therapeutics_, by H. Bence
Jones, London, pp.[Footnote 10: _Physiological Chemistry_, by Charles Henry Ralfe,
London, 1883.]The so-called cholagogues are unquestionably useful, but they become
less and less necessary according to the success achieved in the
dietetic course.Phosphate of soda is one of the most effective of this
group of medicines.As it acts as a compound, and not as a salt of soda
merely, it does not come within the prohibition against the use of soda
salts.It promotes the flow of bile and appears to remove the catarrhal
state of the mucous membrane.A teaspoonful three times a day is the
quantity usually required.Under some circumstances it may be
advantageously combined with arseniate of soda.Mercurials were
formerly almost universally used, but they have been largely supplanted
by podophyllin, euonymin, baptisin, etc., and by the phosphate of soda
above mentioned.Podophyllin is indicated when constipation is a
symptom.An efficient mode of giving it is in the form of granules, but
it must be continued without intermission for some time or during the
existence of {973} the lithaemia.The quantity given should be
sufficient to maintain the evacuations in a soluble state.Good results
are obtained from a combination of podophyllin with extracts of
physostigma, nux vomica, and belladonna.When distinct torpor of the
liver without constipation exists, euonymin, combined with physostigma,
may be advantageously used.For the vertigo and hypochondriasis no
remedy is more beneficial than arsenic (Fowler's solution) in small
doses kept up for some time, and it is also distinctly curative of the
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane.When malarial infection is the
cause of lithaemia, quinine becomes indispensable.Topical agents in some cases render important aid to the other curative
measures.A daily sponge-bath, the water made more stimulating by the
addition of sea-salt, is very useful in the absence of sea-bathing.Friction of the hepatic region with the official ointment of the red
iodide of mercury unquestionably stimulates the hepatic functions.General faradization and faradic and galvanic excitation of the
chylopoietic system promotes activity of the digestive apparatus and of
the organic functions in general.Hepatic Glycosuria (Temporary).DEFINITION.--By the term hepatic glycosuria in this connection is meant
a temporary glycosuria due to excessive formation of glycogen.The
liver, unduly stimulated, produces more glycogen than can be disposed
of, and hence it is excreted by the kidneys as grape-sugar.PATHOGENY.--In the normal condition it is supposed that the glycogen
produced by the liver is converted into grape-sugar, and soon oxidized
and thus consumed.One theory of diabetes maintained that in some way
the conversion of glycogen into grape-sugar was excessive and beyond
the oxidizing power of the blood, and hence this substance was
discharged in the urine.The recent discovery by Pavy[11] of glycogen
in considerable amount in the blood of all parts of the body renders it
certain that there are peculiar conditions necessary to the formation
of grape-sugar in sufficient quantity to constitute diabetes.It is
tolerably certain that an excess of acid in the intestinal canal,
diminishing thus the alkalinity of the blood, will have as a symptom
sugar in the urine.Persons disposed to the accumulation of fat, and
eating freely of sugar and starchy food, are apt to have intestinal
indigestion, and the acid produced by the fermentation of these
substances will, after its absorption, hinder the conversion of any
food-sugar.In such subjects also there may be an increased conversion
of the glycogen of the blood into sugar under the same conditions.Such
a glycosuria must necessarily be temporary and a purely functional
disorder.[Footnote 11: _The Lancet_, vol.SYMPTOMS.--The subjects of the malady under consideration are of full
habit, even obese.They habitually consume considerable quantities of
malt liquors and a diet composed largely of the starchy and saccharine
foods.If not in malt liquors, they at least indulge freely in bread,
potatoes, pastry, cakes--in all forms of farinaceous food, fats, and
sweets.They have a keen appetite, eat largely, and drink freely of
fluids.As {974} a rule, these subjects are but little disposed to
physical exercise and lead rather sedentary lives.Indulgence in such a
mode of life tends to increase the accumulation of fat, weakens the
muscles, and with them the heart-muscle, and slowly induces a
gastro-intestinal catarrh accompanied by stomachal and intestinal
indigestion.At first, heaviness, oppression, and drowsiness after
meals are experienced; then acidity, pyrosis, and eructations follow;
and ultimately the evidences of intestinal indigestion--flatulence,
pain, irregular and unhealthy evacuations, etc.--come on.Meanwhile,
the appetite is not usually impaired, and the disposition to drink
fluids increases; the amount of urine voided is greater, and to rise
during the night for the purpose of emptying the bladder comes to be a
fixed habit.The urine under these circumstances is copious,
high-, acid, and deposits on cooling abundantly of uric acid and
urates.The amount passed in twenty-four hours will reach sixty,
eighty, or more ounces, and the specific gravity will range from 1025
to 1035.On testing in the usual way, traces of sugar, more or less
distinct, will appear,[12] but not constantly, and hence repeated
examinations are necessary to determine the quantity.As a rule, the
evidence of the presence of sugar in small amount is satisfactory.[Footnote 12: In testing for sugar, when the urine contains the urates
in such abundance there is danger of error.In using Trommer's,
Fehling's, or Moore's test, on heating, the urates will effect a
reduction of the copper or bismuth.It is necessary, therefore, to
separate them before applying the test.This is accomplished as
follows: The urine is evaporated to dryness on a water-bath; the sugar
in the evaporated residue is dissolved out by absolute alcohol, and
then an aqueous solution is prepared, to which the test is applied.An
experienced operator will not need to take such precautions, for,
familiar with the reactions, he can readily judge of the results.]Various affections of the skin appear in the subjects of this malady,
and urticaria, prurigo, eczema, and boils are the forms most usual.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Slow in developing, this temporary
glycosuria is also slow in its course.It remains nearly stationary for
months, even years.Meanwhile the degenerative changes associated with
it slowly develop on all sides.The quantity of sugar does not greatly
increase, for its amount, being apparently dependent on the quantity of
acid entering the blood from the intestinal canal, must continue nearly
at the same standard.It is comparatively rare for true diabetes to
develop out of this state, although such a termination must be regarded
as a natural outcome.One reason, it may be, why such a conclusion is
not often reached is because of intercurrent maladies.It is an
important fact that acute serous--less often
parenchymatous--inflammations are very apt to occur during the
existence of even temporary glycosuria.Under appropriate management
this disorder is readily amenable to treatment.Hence the prognosis
will be favorable or not according to the skill exhibited in its
treatment.DIAGNOSIS.--This malady offers no special difficulty in diagnosis.From
gastro-duodenal catarrh and from lithaemia it is distinguished by the
saccharine condition of the urine.From diabetes it is separated by the
rate of progress, by the protracted duration of the case without any
distinct advance, and by the temporary and fugitive character of the
glycosuria.TREATMENT.--To carefully regulate the diet is the first consideration.The traces of sugar and the excess of urates rapidly disappear when the
{975} starches, sugar, and fats are withdrawn from the diet.Indeed,
the rule as to alimentation must be as rigidly enforced as in true
diabetes, but after the gastro-intestinal catarrh has subsided the
ordinary mixed diet--that before the disturbance began--may be returned
to gradually.Active exercise must be enjoined under the same
conditions and for the same purpose as in the treatment of lithaemia.In these obese subjects, unaccustomed to movement, exercise must be
cautiously undertaken; beginning with short excursions, it must be
gradually increased.Horseback riding is an excellent expedient, but
should not take the place of walking.The merely medical measures have a twofold direction: to remove the
gastro-duodenal catarrh; to promote oxidation of the sugar in the blood
or prevent the conversion of glycogen into grape-sugar.Vichy water,
the potash salts, and alkalies generally serve to accomplish the
latter, and phosphate and arseniate of soda, tinctures of nux vomica,
and of physostigma, bismuth, and carbolic acid, relieve the former.Small doses of Fowler's solution (two drops ter in die), and a minim
three times a day of a mixture in equal parts of tincture of iodine and
carbolic acid, are effective remedies in gastro-duodenal catarrh.DEFINITION.--The term jaundice has its origin in the French word jaune,
yellow.Icterus, which has come to be a more technical word, is of
uncertain Greek origin, and is much employed by French writers as
ictere.The common German name is Gelbsucht, a highly expressive
designation.Jaundice signifies a yellow discoloration of the skin
caused by the presence of bile.As a symptom it will receive much consideration in the pages to follow,
but there is also a functional disorder--a jaundice due to a
disturbance in the biliary functions, without evidences of structural
change--which must be discussed here.This preliminary statement of our
present knowledge of jaundice will facilitate the comprehension of it
as a symptom, and will render unnecessary explanations that will be
merely a repetition of previous ones.CAUSES.--The theories of the causation of jaundice may be reduced to
three: 1, that it is due to a disorganization of the blood in which the
coloring matter is set free, and hence is known as haematogenous; 2,
that the materials of the bile, which it is the office of the liver to
remove from the blood, are not so disposed of; 3, that the bile, after
being formed by the liver, is absorbed into the blood because of an
obstacle to its escape, and hence this is called hepatogenous jaundice.The modern view of haematogenous jaundice had its origin in the
supposed discovery of the identity of haematoidin with bilirubin.If
the pigment of the blood has the same composition as the pigment of the
bile, haematogenous jaundice will be produced whenever haematoidin is
set free in the blood.Virchow[13] was the first investigator to show
the close resemblance between these two pigments.Since his observation
was made an identity of haematoidin and bilirubin has been maintained
by Zenker, Valentiner, Kuhne, and others, and as strenuously denied by
{976} Stadeler, Preyer, Young, and others.At the present time it
appears to be established that although the blood- and bile-pigments
are closely related, they are not identical.[14] Nevertheless, a
haematogenous jaundice is still admitted to exist by Leyden,[15]
Immermann,[16] Gubler,[17] Ponfick,[18] and some others.The existence
or non-existence of this form of jaundice is, however, of little
importance in this connection, since, if it ever occur, the malady of
which it is a symptom is not an affection of the liver, but of the
blood, as phosphorus-poisoning, pyaemia, etc.[Footnote 13: _Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band i. p.[Footnote 14: Legg, J. Wickham, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious
Diseases_, p.[Footnote 15: _Beitrage zur Pathologie des Icterus_, Berlin, 1866, p.[Footnote 17: _Union medicale_, 1857, p.[Footnote 18: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.The second theory, that the bile is preformed in the blood and
separated by the liver, and that jaundice results because of the
failure of the liver to perform this office, is no longer entertained,
although largely held down to within a very recent period.As the bile
acids and bile-pigments are not to be found in the blood, chemistry
lends no support to the theory of jaundice by suppression of the
hepatic function.As they do not exist in the blood and are found in
the secretion of the liver, there can be no other view held than that
they are formed by this organ.[19]

[Footnote 19: The old doctrine of jaundice by suppression, which has
always been maintained by Harley (_On Jaundice_, London, 1863, p.20
_et seq._), has been again restated and strongly advocated by him in
his treatise on _The Diseases of the Liver_, p.83, which was issued in
1883.In the two following postulates he formulates his view:

"1.The biliary secretion can be actually retarded, and even totally
arrested, without alteration of hepatic tissue.When the liver strikes work and secretes no bile, the animal body
becomes jaundiced as a direct consequence thereof."This view, he affirms, "can be made comparatively easy of absolute
proof."The evidence on which he chiefly relies is exceedingly fallacious.It
rests on two facts: the existence of a case of jaundice in which the
ducts and gall-bladder contain no bile, but only ordinary mucus; the
appearances presented by a liver in a case of jaundice due to
obstruction of the common duct.The evidence afforded by the former is
entirely fallacious, because in an old case of jaundice with catarrh of
the bile-ducts such changes take place in the bile that it loses all of
its distinctive characteristics.This may be seen in an ancient example
of obstruction of the cystic duct, where the bile which the
gall-bladder contained is ultimately transformed into a whitish or
colorless mucus.The changes which occur in the so-called cysts of the
arachnoid are comparable, and exhibit the entire transformation of
blood-pigment, which is closely allied to bile-pigment.]The third theory of jaundice--that which refers the disease to an
absorption of the bile into the blood after it has been formed by the
liver--is the one now most generally held, and, indeed, as one of the
causes is universally held.The bile is absorbed into the blood because
an obstacle to its passage by the bile-ducts exists at some point in
their course.This is the principal, but not the only, cause of
absorption.When the pressure in the vessels falls below that in the
ducts, bile will pass toward and into the vessels.Again, it sometimes
happens that a considerable part of the bile discharged into the
intestines is reabsorbed unchanged, and enters the portal vein and the
general circulation, thus causing jaundice.The disturbances of the liver causing jaundice are various.It
sometimes occurs without cause, and the first intimation of it is the
peculiar tint of the skin.It is certainly true that powerful emotions
are causative; thus, a violent anger has brought on an attack.In such
a case we must suppose a depression of the vaso-motor system, and such
a lowering of the blood-pressure as to favor the passage of bile into
the {977} veins rather than into the bile-ducts.Thus, it has been
abundantly shown that a slight difference in pressure will divert the
bile in either direction.Heidenhain[20] has demonstrated that the bile
passes in the direction of least resistance, and in the case of the
considerable vaso-motor depression caused by extreme emotion the least
resistance is in the direction of the vessels.More frequently than
moral emotion is catarrh of the bile-ducts.It is not necessary for the
catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane to close the ducts to have
the bile pass into the veins; such a degree of swelling as to make the
passage of the bile somewhat difficult suffices.A simple hyperaemia of
the mucous membrane may cause sufficient obstruction of the bile-ducts
to give rise to jaundice.Gastro-intestinal catarrh plays an important
part in the production of simple jaundice.Frerichs[21] ascertained
that of 41 cases, gastro-duodenal catarrh existed in 34.Ponfick[22]
considers catarrh of the ducts the principal factor.In fact, at the
present time there is but one dissenting voice on this point.[23]

[Footnote 20: Quoted by Legg, _supra_, p.[Footnote 21: _Diseases of the Liver_, Syd.[Footnote 22: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 23: Harley, _Diseases of the Liver_, 1883, p.440 _et seq._]

Gastro-duodenal catarrh extends by contiguity of tissue to the mucous
lining of the bile-ducts.The catarrhal state of the mucous membrane is
produced by errors of diet, acid indigestion, indulgence in condiments,
wines, and rich foods in general.Climatic changes, malarial infection,
exposure to cold and dampness, etc.are indirectly causative of
jaundice through the intermediation of gastro-duodenal catarrh.Formerly, obstruction of the gall-ducts was supposed to be caused
sometimes by a spasmodic contraction of the organic muscular fibre
assumed to exist in the walls of the ducts.Although the presence of
these muscular elements has been denied, Heidenhain has lately,
apparently, demonstrated them.Audige has made observations
confirmatory of those of Heidenhain, and Dujardin-Beaumetz[24] has
verified the statements of Audige.It seems, therefore, in a high
degree probable that organic muscular elements exist in the walls of
the hepatic ducts, and that spasmodic icterus may therefore occur.SYMPTOMS.--Simple icterus may exist without any other obvious symptoms
than the yellow discoloration of the skin.In most cases, however, the
yellowness is preceded for a week or more by the symptoms of a
gastro-intestinal catarrh, or these symptoms accompany the jaundice.There is much mental depression and a general malaise is experienced.Headache, mental hebetude, a total loss of appetite, a furred tongue,
and a bitter taste, nausea and sometimes vomiting, constipation or
diarrhoea, precede or accompany the jaundice.When these symptoms
precede for some time the appearance of yellowness, it is probable that
the biliary derangement is secondary to the gastro-duodenal catarrh,
but when they occur with the jaundice it is probable that they are due
to the absence of bile from the intestine.The yellowness first appears in the conjunctiva for a day or two before
the skin is tinted, and within forty-eight hours after the flow of bile
into the intestine has ceased.The face next becomes yellow, then the
body, {978} and afterward the limbs, but in some cases the limbs remain
free from discoloration.The lips do not exhibit any change of color,
but the roof of the mouth, the palate, and the mucous membrane under
the tongue are yellow.The saliva does not, as a rule, contain
bile-pigment or exhibit any changes of color unless mercurial
salivation is caused, when it becomes greenish in color and has a
bitter taste.[25] A yellow tint of the sweat, especially under the
arm-pits, is common.The milk very often contains bile-pigment or is
changed in color in some way.[Footnote 25: Legg, _On the Bile, etc._, _supra_.]The feces are colorless or have a grayish or clay- tint, and are
semi-solid, although sometimes hard and dry.In simple jaundice
diarrhoea is very often present.There may be considerable flatulence,
and more or less pain in consequence about the umbilicus, and the gas
when discharged is very offensive.The stools also, in some cases, have
an odor of decomposition, and if carefully examined particles of food,
undigested and decomposing, will be found.The feces may have a
parti-<DW52> appearance--part whitish or grayish or clay-, and
part of a normal color.The obstruction to the flow of bile may be in a part, and indeed in a
small part comparatively, of the liver, and hence there may be
sufficient bile flow down to color the feces to a greater or less
extent.But a small amount of bile-pigment in the blood suffices to
tint the whole surface of the body.The urine may exhibit changes in appearance before the conjunctiva
becomes yellow.It is  in all possible degrees, from a merely
high normal hue to a deep brownish almost black tint.It may be deep
red and clear like dark brandy or brown like porter, and thick with
urates.Usually, the urine of jaundice deposits abundantly of urates,
but this fact is more especially true of those patients retaining
appetite or having a voracious appetite and indulging in a full diet
without restraint.The reaction of the urine is acid, and the specific
gravity does not often descend below 1010, and may be 1030.The amount
passed in twenty-four hours varies, but does not differ materially from
the normal.Toward the termination of some fatal cases the quantity of
urine has greatly diminished, and in a few instances was suppressed,
but in such examples other factors than hepatic disease were concerned.More or less albumen is nearly constantly present in the urine of
jaundice, but the detection of a trace is very difficult when the
urine, as is so often the case, is cloudy.The urine should be
carefully filtered before applying the test, and a specimen for
comparison should be placed alongside of that being examined.If on
boiling no haze appears, it may be developed by dropping in some nitric
acid.The nitric-acid test, so often employed by allowing some drops of
urine to trickle down the test-tube and observing the reaction at the
point of contact, is, in the writer's experience, very fallacious.The
source of the albumen in jaundiced urine is obviously the
blood-globules.As Von Dusch first demonstrated, and Kuhne[26]
afterward clearly confirmed, the bile acids dissolve the red
corpuscles.As the quantity of albumen in the urine is small, it is
reasonable to conclude, as suggested by Legg, that the bile acids are
not present in the blood in any considerable amount.[Footnote 26: _Archiv fur path.When any large quantity of bile is contained in the urine, its
detection is not difficult.A strip of muslin dipped in the urine will
be stained, and the underclothing of the patient will have the
yellowish spots {979} caused by bile.Gmelin's test is the most
convenient.This is applied as follows: Some nitric acid containing
nitrous--which is the case of the ordinary commercial article--is put
into a test-tube, and some of the suspected urine is allowed to trickle
down the side of the tube to come in contact, but not mix, with the
acid.At the point of contact, when the urine contains bile-pigment,
first a zone of green, then blue, violet, and finally red color,
develops.As this play of colors takes place on the instant, the
attention must be sharply fixed to see the changes.Rosenbach[27]
suggests this test be applied by filtering some urine containing bile
through filtering-paper and touching the paper with a drop of nitric
acid.The result is, a green circle forms at the point of contact.The
usual mode of applying Gmelin's test is to place on the bottom of a
common white plate or on a porcelain dish a thin film of the urine, and
carefully bring in contact with it a thin film of nitric acid.The
color reaction mentioned above takes place at the margin of contact.[Footnote 27: _Centralblatt fur die medicin Wissenschaft_, 1876, p.Besides the presence of bile and albumen, and some fatty epithelium
from the tubules, there is no material change in the composition of the
urine.At one time it was supposed that the amount of urea was greatly
lessened, but later and more accurate investigations have shown that
this excretion is in greater or less quantity according to the food
taken, and bears no relation to the jaundice.On the other hand,
Genevoix[28] maintains that the quantity of urea is increased in
spasmodic icterus, and in the same ratio the uric acid declines.As
regards the chlorides and other salts, there seems to be a tolerably
constant ratio in their variations with the changes of quantity of urea
and uric acid--are therefore nearly related to the amount of food
taken.[Footnote 28: _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree et de l'Acide urique
dans les Maladies du Foie_, Paris, 1876, p.59 _et seq._]

As regards the condition of the liver, there is no apparent change.In
topography, in the area of hepatic dulness, and in the dimensions of
the right hypochondrium the local condition does not deviate from the
normal in simple jaundice.There may be more or less tenderness over
the epigastrium and along the inferior margin of the liver, but there
is rarely any actual pain.The circulation of bile in the blood and the action of the bile acids
on the red corpuscles must have an influence on the functions of
various organs.In some cases of jaundice, but by no means in all, the
pulse is slow, in a few instances descending as low as 40 per minute,
and, according to Frerichs,[29] as low as 21 per minute.Usually, the
pulse-rate is not lower than 60.To observe the slowing of the heart
the patient must be recumbent, for the pulse rises to the normal or
above on assuming the erect posture and moving about.The occurrence of
fever also prevents the depression of the circulation.The slowing of
the heart is found to be due to the action of the bile acids on the
cardiac ganglia.The other elements of the bile were ascertained to
have no influence on the circulation.As the heart may be slowed by an
increase of inhibition through stimulation of the vagi or by a
paralyzing action on the cardiac muscle, it was necessary to eliminate
these effects to establish the influence of the bile acids on the
ganglia.By exclusion, and by ascertaining the effects {980} of the
bile acids on a properly prepared Stannius heart, Steiner and Legg have
succeeded in demonstrating this important point.[30]

[Footnote 29: _Diseases of the Liver_, Syd.[Footnote 30: _Archiv f. Anat.u. Physiol._, 1874, p.474; Legg, _On
the Bile, etc._, _loc.cit._]

The temperature of jaundice is normal usually, sometimes below.When a
febrile affection occurs during the course of jaundice, the rise of
temperature belonging to it is prevented in considerable part,
sometimes entirely.The depression of temperature is referred by Legg
to the lessened activity of the hepatic functions; but it seems to the
writer more satisfactory to refer it to the action of the bile acids on
the red corpuscles, the conveyors of oxygen.Rohrig[31] has shown
experimentally that the injection of bile acids has this effect on the
temperature of animals.[Footnote 31: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1863, p.The nutrition of the body early suffers in jaundice; more or less loss
of flesh soon occurs, and debility and languor are experienced.There
are several factors concerned in this result.The diversion of the bile
from the intestine interferes in the digestion of certain materials;
when jaundice occurs, glycogen ceases to be formed--and this substance
has an important office in nutrition and force-evolution--and the
injury done to the red blood-globules interferes with oxidation
processes.The functions of the nervous system are variously disturbed in
jaundice.Headache, frontal, occipital, or general, is present in most
cases to a greater or less extent.Hebetude of mind and despondency are
nearly if not quite invariable, although it is not unusual to see men
with jaundice engaged in their ordinary avocations.More or less wakefulness at night, or sleep with
disturbing dreams, not unfrequently coincide with drowsiness during the
waking moments.In severe cases of icterus dependent on structural
changes the cholaemia may produce stupor, delirium, convulsions, etc.,
but such formidable symptoms do not belong to the simple and merely
functional jaundice.Vision is sometimes  yellow, or, rather, white objects appear
yellow, but this must be a rare symptom, since Frerichs never met with
an example.Murchison[32] narrates a case, and the writer has seen one.It is a fugitive symptom, rarely continuing longer than two or three
days.The term xanthopsy has been applied to it.[Footnote 32: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, New York,
1877, p.A nervous symptom of common occurrence is pruritus of the skin.This
may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and in any case is a disagreeable
and persistent affection, always worse at night.It may appear before
the jaundice so long a period as ten days, as in a case mentioned by
Graves,[33] and two months in a case narrated by Flint.[34] It is most
severe at the beginning of the jaundice, and usually disappears before
the jaundice ceases, but it may continue to the end.It is not limited
to any particular part of the body.Pruritus is sometimes accompanied
by urticaria, and the irritation caused by the friction of the skin may
set up an eczema.Occasionally boils, and more rarely carbuncles,
appear during the course of jaundice.Another curious affection of the
skin which occurs during chronic jaundice is xanthelasma or
vitiligoidea.First mentioned by Rayer, this disease was afterward well
described by Addison and Gull[35] under the name vitiligoidea, and they
recognized two varieties, v. plana and v. tuberosa.The plane variety
is found on the {981} mucous membrane of the mouth, the eyelids, the
palms of the hands, and the flexures of the joints, and consists of a
yellowish-white soft eruption slightly raised above the surrounding
skin and varying in size from a pin's point to a dime in size.The
color is described as like that of a dead leaf or chamois-skin.The
tuberose variety consists of small tubercles from a millet-seed to a
pea in size.They have a yellowish color, are tense and shining, and
are placed on the ears, neck, knuckles, elbows, knees, and other parts.Whilst the plane variety gives little if any uneasiness, the tuberose
is apt to become irritated and painful.From the pathological point of
view this eruption consists of proliferating connective-tissue
corpuscles, some of which have undergone fatty degeneration.[36] The
morbid process tends to occur symmetrically, as on the eyelids, to
which it may be confined, but it usually develops in patches, and may
indeed extend over the whole body, when it is called xanthelasma
multiplex.[Footnote 33: _Clinical Lectures on the Practice of Medicine_, 2d ed.,
by Neligan, p.[Footnote 35: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1851, p.[Footnote 36: Waldeyer, _Archiv fur path.The disorganization of the blood caused by jaundice sets up a
hemorrhagic diathesis.This result, however, is not usual in simple
jaundice, but belongs rather to acute yellow atrophy, sclerosis, and
other chronic affections of the liver.It will therefore be more
appropriately considered in connection with those maladies.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--When jaundice is a symptom merely,
it pursues a course determined by the peculiarities of the disease.The
duration of simple jaundice varies from one to four weeks, the average
being about three weeks.If it continues longer than two months,
suspicions may well be entertained that the case is of a more
formidable character than simple jaundice.The termination of this form
of the disease is always in health.A favorable prognosis can be given
only in the case of an accurate diagnosis.Those cases may terminate
more speedily which, being of malarial origin, are treated by efficient
doses of quinine.If delirium and coma come on, the apparently mild
case means, probably, acute yellow atrophy, which cannot at the onset
be distinguished from simple jaundice.If any nervous symptoms occur or
if hemorrhage appears, the case will prove to be serious.A rise of
temperature usually indicates mischief.When the stools begin to
exhibit the normal appearance from the presence of bile, a satisfactory
termination of the case may be soon expected.The yellowness of the
skin disappears slowly after the natural route of the bile has been
restored, and the urine is the last to lose the pigment, as it was the
first to exhibit its presence.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of jaundice as a symptom is usually easy.It
should be remembered that jaundice cannot be detected at night by any
ordinary light, and when it is disappearing the tint varies, now being
distinct, again absent.Mental emotion when the color is fading
develops it.Browning by the sun's rays causes an appearance which
might be mistaken by a superficial observer for jaundice, but it is
only necessary to look at the parts protected and at the urine to
discover the true state of the case.The detection of bile in the urine
and the ocular evidence of its absence from the stools will be
conclusive.In some cases of jaundice the stools are golden yellow, and
in many instances they are offensive.{982} It is important to mark out the limits of the gall-bladder, if it
is of sufficient size to do so, for any accumulation of bile in this
sac signifies an obstruction of the ductus communis choledochus.If the
jaundice has come on after the symptoms of gastro-duodenal catarrh, is
recent, continues but two or three weeks, and then subsides without any
nervous symptoms or hemorrhage, it is a case of simple jaundice,
probably due to catarrh or spasm of the bile-ducts.If the jaundice be
preceded by attacks of severe pain, nausea, and vomiting, and
disappears after a week or two, the case is one of hepatic calculi.If
the jaundice persists months after such an attack of acute pain, and
does not disappear after a year or more, it is probably due to an
impacted calculus.The other diagnostic relations of jaundice are more
properly considered in connection with the malady of which jaundice is
a symptom.TREATMENT.--For jaundice the symptom the treatment is included in that
of the disease.Here the treatment of simple jaundice, the functional
disorder, is to be discussed.If there is much nausea, the tongue is
heavily coated, and, especially if the seizure has followed dietetic
excesses, an emetic of ipecac may be highly serviceable.Recent
experiments have proved the accuracy of the clinical observations which
recognized the cholagogue property of ipecac, and hence the emetic
effect of this remedy is aided by its power to promote the discharge of
bile.Emetics are of course contraindicated when jaundice is due to an
impacted calculus, to malignant disease, to echinococci or other kinds
of tumor.If there is much irritability of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, as shown in vomiting and diarrhoea, small doses of calomel
(1/12 to 1/4 grain) three or four times a day are highly useful.If
calomel possessed the property ascribed to it of stimulating the liver,
it would be injurious; it is beneficial here because it has a sedative
effect at first, followed, when a sufficient amount has accumulated, by
an eliminant action.Such hepatic stimulants as euonymin, sanguinarin,
podophyllin, jalap, colocynth, rhubarb, etc.have long been used in
cases of jaundice with the view that the liver is torpid and needs
stimulating.It may be inquired, however, If the bile already formed
has no outlet by the proper route, what utility can there be in making
the organ produce more?The true reason for the administration of such
remedies in any case of obstructive jaundice is to cause such downward
pressure as to force out of the duct an obstructing plug of mucus.The
writer has known this result to be accomplished by a dose of compound
jalap powder when a great variety of remedies had been employed in
vain.One of the most efficient remedies--in the writer's considerable
experience the most efficient--is phosphate of sodium, of which a
drachm or more is administered three times a day.This remedy liquefies
mucous plugs and promotes the flow of bile without harshly and rudely
forcing the biliary secretion, and it also has a marked curative effect
in gastro-duodenal catarrh.It may be given advantageously with
arseniate of soda--the latter in dose of 1/20 grain--and dissolved in a
tumblerful of Vichy water or Saratoga Vichy water, or preferably in a
wineglassful of hot water.Free use of alkaline and laxative mineral
waters is desirable, for a double purpose--to act on the liver and on
intestinal digestion, and to promote the excretion of biliary matters
by the kidneys.In this country we have a number to select from--the
Saratoga, Bethesda, Michigan, and others.Certain sulphurous waters,
{983} as the Blue Lick of Kentucky, are highly useful in the more
chronic cases.Sulphur baths may be conjoined to the internal
administration of the waters.Nitric and nitro-muriatic acids have long been celebrated for their
good effects in jaundice.It is the presence of the acid chyme in the
duodenum which excites the normal flow of bile, and Bernard found that
applying acid to the orifice of the common duct in the intestine has
the same effect.There is then a rational reason for the administration
of this remedy.A nitro-muriatic bath, both local and general, was
formerly more used than now.Its utility is questionable, and the
difficulties in the way of applying it great.Recently, Gerhardt[37] has proposed to faradize the gall-bladder, and
by compression with the fingers to empty it, forcing the bile into the
intestine, and thus clearing out obstructions.This seems to be very
questionable if not dangerous practice, but repeated successes will
justify it.[Footnote 37: _Sammlung klinische Vortrage_, Volkmann, p.Regulation of the diet is of the first importance.Fats, starches, and
sweets cannot be well digested when no bile enters the small intestine,
where they undergo conversion.These substances fermenting, much acid
results, and hence if a catarrh exist it is increased.An exclusive
diet of skimmed milk, kept up for two weeks or as long as possible, is
the best mode of alimentation for this part of the treatment.Afterward, the diet should be composed of milk, meat-broth, lemonade,
and subsequently of the succulent vegetables, acid fruits, and fresh
meat.Indulgence in malt liquors, wines, and spirits should be strictly
prohibited.A new method of treating jaundice has been lately proposed by
Krull,[38] which has the merit that no injury is done by it if no good
is accomplished.It consists in injecting into the rectum from two to
four pints of water at 60 degrees F., which is retained as long as
possible.Each time the injection is repeated the temperature is raised
a little.Krull reports that he has uniformly succeeded, and has never
found it necessary to repeat the injection more than seven times.It
may be given twice or thrice a day.[Footnote 38: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1877, p.STRUCTURAL DISEASES OF THE LIVER.DEFINITION.--An abnormal quantity of blood in the liver, constantly
present, constitutes hyperaemia or congestion.During the period of
repose there is less, but during the period of activity more, blood
circulating in the liver, but the physiological hyperaemia is not, nor
does it contribute to, a diseased state unless abnormal conditions
continue it beyond the proper limits.The term hyperaemia, here used,
applies to a pathological state in which various structural alterations
grow out of the continual congestion of the blood-vessels of the organ.CAUSES.--A physiological congestion of the liver ensues when the {984}
process of digestion is going on.The afferent vessels dilate, and not
only more blood, but various materials taken up from the foods and
products of digestion, many of them having directly stimulating
effects, also pass to the organ.Frequent and large indulgence in food,
especially if rich in quality and highly seasoned with spices, mustard,
etc., the consumption of malt liquors, wines, and alcoholic fluids in
general, the habitual use of strong coffee and tea, gradually induce a
state of hyperaemia.If to the consumption of a large quantity of
highly-stimulating food there is added the mischief of insufficient
waste, the danger of congestion of the liver is the greater.Persons
addicted to the pleasures of the table are apt to pursue sedentary
lives, and hence, besides the inappropriation of the material digested,
the process of oxidation is insufficient to burn off the surplus.A
sedentary life further tends to make the circulation in the hepatic
veins sluggish by lessening the number and depth of the respirations,
and with the obesity developed under these conditions the propelling
power of the heart is diminished by fatty degeneration or fatty
substitution of the cardiac muscle.Disease of the semilunar ganglion,
the solar plexus, and of the splanchnics under circumstances and of a
nature not now well understood may cause dilatation of the hepatic
vessels.Suppression of a long-existing hemorrhage from piles and from the
uterine system has caused hyperaemia of the liver.Evidences of hepatic
congestion are comparatively common about the menstrual period in
consequence of the tardy appearance of the flow, of its insufficiency,
or of its sudden suppression.There is a form of jaundice known as
icterus menstrualis, and attacks of hepatic congestion are not uncommon
at the climacteric period.The most important causes of hyperaemia of the liver are mechanical,
and consist in obstruction to the circulation in the ascending vena
cava from disease of the heart or lungs.Dilatation of the right
cavities, incompetence of the tricuspid, and stenosis of the mitral
orifice are the usual cardiac changes leading to congestion of the
liver.The same effect, to a much less extent, however, is produced by
any cause which weakens the propelling power of the heart, as
myocarditis, pericarditis, etc.Amongst the pulmonary lesions
obstructing the venous circulation are emphysema, interstitial and
croupous pneumonia, effusions into the pleura, intrathoracic aneurisms
or tumors, etc.It should not be forgotten that effusions into the left
pleura, as was demonstrated by Bartels[39] and confirmed by Roser,[40]
so push over the mediastinum toward the right and bend the vena cava in
the same direction, just as it emerges from the opening in the
diaphragm, that the circulation in this vessel is impeded, and
consequently congestion of the liver induced.[Footnote 39: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.[Footnote 40: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, Band vi.The influence of climate, especially of long-continued high
temperature, has been warmly disputed.On the whole, it seems probable
that in warm climates congestion of the liver is much more common.In the section on
Jaundice it was stated that this symptom may occur without the
phenomena of fever, and, indeed, without any other disturbance of the
system.In a large proportion of cases of intermittent fever, probably
in all, more or less congestion of the liver occurs.{985} PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Congestion may take place in the portal
system, and be due to conditions of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, or in the hepatic vein and radicles, due to obstructive
troubles in the heart or lungs.Restricting the observations to the hyperaemia, and not including
subsequent lesions, it suffices to say that the liver is somewhat
enlarged, rather darker in color than the normal, and uniformly so; the
radicles and branches of the portal vein in the liver, the trunk of the
vein itself, and the veins of the spleen, stomach, intestines,
mesentery, etc.are distended with black blood, and the tissue of the
liver rather wet, inclined to soften, and here and there marked by
minute hemorrhages from rupture of small vessels.The extravasations of
blood accompany the hepatic congestion of hot climates, and probably
are the preludes to suppurative inflammation.The portal system the
more readily suffers from a passive congestion because of the provision
for the alternate expansion and contraction of the tunics of the
vessel, scantily supplied with contractile elements.An acute
congestion of the liver produced by sudden dilatation of the
capillaries of the hepatic artery has not been described, but it would
appear to be possible.The most important form of hepatic congestion is the mechanical,
arising from obstruction of the circulation in the heart or lungs.In
consequence of this obstruction the blood accumulates on the venous
side, and there is in consequence an ischaemia of the arterial side.The hepatic vein becomes distended, and its terminal radicle in the
centre of each acinus--the central vein--enlarges with the increased
pressure.It follows that the minute capillaries emptying into the
central vein are also distended with blood, and finally the portal vein
and its radicles throughout are similarly affected.The same condition
of the hepatic circulation was long ago observed by Virchow[41] as a
result of weakness of the muscular tissue of the heart, and
consequently diminished propelling power of the organ.On section of
the liver much black blood flows out; each central vein is a distinct
dark object in the centre of each acinus, and contrasts strongly with
the surrounding paler substance, whence the common term for this
appearance is nutmeg liver.The long-continued distension of the
central vein leads to sclerosis of its walls,[42] and the neighboring
hepatic cells undergo atrophy in consequence of the greater pressure.A
relatively increased quantity of connective tissue seems to result, but
whether hyperplasia occurs is disputed.By Talamon[43] such increase of
the connective tissue is denied, but Thierfelder[44] admits that there
is an apparent and also in some cases a real increase.The atrophy of
the cells induces more or less shrinking and consolidation of the
liver; it is therefore smaller in size and firmer in texture, and
presents a brownish-red color.The atrophic change in the hepatic cells
is represented finally by some brownish or black pigment, but it is
rare, indeed, for all the cells of an acinus to disappear.To this
change has been applied the term cyanotic atrophy.In some instances
Liebermeister[45] {986} has found an increase of the connective tissue
of the liver; and this opinion is confirmed by Legg.[46] When this
multiplication of the connective tissue occurs, the condition of the
liver is entitled cyanotic induration.The sclerosis originating in
this way is distinguished from true cirrhosis by its less extent,
irregularity, situation, and the marked degree of hepatic congestion.[Footnote 41: _Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band v. p.[Footnote 42: Talamon, _Recherches anatomo-pathologiques et cliniques
sur le Foie cardiaque_, Paris, 1881 (pamphlet).][Footnote 43: _Ibid._]

Leberkrankheiten_, Tubingen, 1864, p.209 _et seq._]

[Footnote 46: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.SYMPTOMS.--Hyperaemia of the liver is usually one of the complex
conditions of a morbid state, and hence is associated in its
symptomatology with the connected maladies.On the one hand associated
with gastro-intestinal disorders, on the other with cardiac and
pulmonary diseases, the symptoms must be varied accordingly.It is
necessary, however, to indicate as clearly as may be those belonging to
the hepatic circulation.Congestion of the portal circulation is a condition to which frequent
references are made, but which is rarely clearly defined.As seen in
the West and South, it signifies a gastro-intestinal catarrh more or
less acute, with an obvious condition of biliousness, as manifested in
a faint jaundiced tint of the skin and of the conjunctivae, uneasiness
in the right hypochondrium, with enlargement of the area of hepatic
dulness, the evacuations from the bowels being either grayish or
clay-, or more frequently bilious, acrid, and offensive.The gastro-intestinal disorder which initiates the hepatic disturbance
should not be confounded with that which succeeds to congestion of the
hepatic veins.The latter invariably comes on after the obstruction at
the heart or lungs has continued for some time.There occurs in this
state very extensive hyperaemia of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, and consequent disorders of stomachal and intestinal
digestion.The former is a reflex cause of disturbance, probably
through the intermediation of the solar plexus.The gastro-intestinal
irritation, by depressing the functions of the hepatic through the
solar plexus, induces a paresis of the muscular layer of the portal
system, and thus congestion ensues.Such a result is aided by high
temperature, but especially by the constitutional tendencies of some
subjects to hepatic disturbances.In such examples of hyperaemia the
symptoms consist of those belonging to gastro-intestinal catarrh,
succeeded by those referable to the liver, consisting in uneasiness,
heaviness, and fulness of the right hypochondrium, increase in the area
of hepatic dulness, soreness on pressure along the inferior margin of
the ribs and over the epigastric region, yellowness of the
conjunctivae, a fawn color of the skin generally, and high-
rather scanty urine, depositing abundantly uric acid and urates.A
liver considerably enlarged and projecting one or two fingers' breadths
below the ribs may be quickly relieved and return to the normal size on
the occurrence of hemorrhage from piles or after free watery
evacuations produced by a hydragogue cathartic.The form of hepatic congestion most usually observed is that of the
hepatic vein, caused by obstructive troubles of the heart or lungs, and
known as the nutmeg liver.The increase of size of the liver under
these circumstances may be very considerable.To determine an increase
in the area of hepatic dulness the position of the organ must be
ascertained with reference to the position of the body, whether
recumbent or erect.In the former position the liver gravitates toward
the thorax; in the {987} latter, downward into the abdomen.If
palpation only were employed to detect an increase in the size of the
organ, an error might readily be committed in this respect.Some
congestion may doubtless exist without an actual increase of size
recognizable by our means of investigation; there may be merely some
distension manifested by a sense of increased resistance; the liver may
project a hand's breadth below the ribs; and between these extremes
there may be all possible degrees of enlargement.When the liver, in
consequence of hyperaemia, projects below the ribs, it offers to the
sense of touch the impression of a smooth, elastic, rather rounded
surface, and not the hardness and nodular character of sclerosis, and
not the sharpness of border and hardness of texture belonging to
amyloid disease.The enlargement of the liver due to hyperaemia is
further distinguished by the fact that it varies much in size at
different times, and may be much reduced by hemorrhage from the portal
system, and increased suddenly by an attack of dyspnoea.When the liver is enlarged by hyperaemia the patient usually has a
distinct appreciation of the fact, feels a sense of weight, tenderness,
and oppression in the right hypochondrium, and experiences a painful
dragging from the right toward the left when turned on the left side.In some cases pain is felt in the shoulder, or, if not pain, a feeling
of weight.A slight icteroid hue of the conjunctiva, face, upper
extremities, and trunk is often present, but the stools are not wanting
in bile and the urine contains but little pigment--facts indicating
that the obstruction is limited to a small number of ducts.If the
jaundice is decided, the stools clay-, and the urine loaded with
pigment, a catarrhal swelling of the common or hepatic duct exists.As nutmeg liver is an incident in the course of the venous stasis from
cardiac or pulmonary obstructive disease, it is not unusual to find
ascites and general dropsy occur.When ascites precedes the other
manifestations of dropsy, and is relatively more important, the hepatic
congestion has led to atrophy of the cells and contraction of the
organ, or to cyanotic induration, as it has been designated in
contradistinction to cirrhotic induration.The subjects of hepatic congestion, especially of that form of the
malady due to gastro-intestinal irritation, are apt to experience no
little mental depression, even hypochondriasis, as, indeed, is usual in
most cases of hepatic disease.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The behavior of any case of
hyperaemia of the liver is determined, first, by the character of the
cause, and, secondly, by the extension of the mischief and the atrophic
changes which ensue.The congestion arising from gastro-intestinal
irritation is comparatively short-lived, since the causal conditions
may usually be promptly removed.It is far different in the cases due
to pulmonary or cardiac disease.If caused by a left pleuritic
exudation, the congestion will disappear as soon as the bend in the
ascending vena cava is removed by paracentesis.If, however, produced
by a permanent pulmonary obstruction, the course of the hepatic disease
is toward cyanotic induration.The same is true of obstructive cardiac
lesions.If compensation--as, for example, of a mitral
regurgitation--is not effected, the continual congestion must lead to
the ultimate lesions of the liver; but if compensation can be brought
about, the liver will be saved the irremediable {988} changes.The
prognosis, therapeutical and pathological, must necessarily be
dependent on the lesions of which the hyperaemia of the liver is merely
a symptom.DIAGNOSIS.--The decision in any case of hyperaemia of the liver must
rest on the determination of the gastro-intestinal, pulmonary, or
cardiac diseases causative.When, for example, to the gastro-intestinal
disturbance or cardiac disease there are added heaviness, uneasiness,
increased area of dulness of the right hypochondrium, a hyperaemia of
the liver may be concluded to exist.The extent to which the organ is
damaged may be judged from its size, the duration of the congestion,
and the character of the determining cause.If the area of hepatic
dulness declines steadily after having been increased, the causative
conditions continuing, the shrinking is due to atrophy.This view is
confirmed if ascites has appeared and increased out of proportion to
the general dropsy.TREATMENT.--Those cases of hyperaemia dependent on excesses in eating
and drinking require the substitution of a diet composed of lean meat,
skimmed milk, acid fruits, and such succulent vegetables as lettuce,
tomatoes, celery, etc.When there is a high degree of gastro-intestinal
catarrh, an absolute milk diet may be enforced with great advantage.enjoined in the section devoted to
lithaemia are equally applicable here.Amongst the special plans of
diet sometimes advocated in the condition of abdominal plethora or
portal congestion are the grape cure, the whey cure, etc.Great good is
accomplished by a simple diet and a course of the Saratoga saline
laxative waters--the Congress, Hathorn, Geyser, etc.The alkaline
waters of Wisconsin and Michigan, the White Sulphur of Virginia, and
others having similar properties in this country may be employed for
the same purpose.The saline laxatives, Pullna, Friedrichshall, and
other purgative salines, may be used in robust, plethoric subjects with
much portal congestion, hemorrhoids, etc.Phosphate of soda, given in
sufficient quantity to maintain a soluble state of the bowels, is also
a useful remedy.The resinous cathartics, podophyllin, jalap, rhubarb,
aloes, euonymin, iridin, baptisin, etc., are all useful when the
indication is to unload the portal circulation.The mercurials,
formerly so much used, are now discredited to an unwarranted degree.In
an irritable state of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane calomel in
small doses is remarkably useful.The treatment of congestion of the hepatic vein is included in that of
the lesion causing it.In some rather exceptional cases the liver
enlarges considerably in consequence of incompetence of the mitral,
without there being any other conspicuous evidence of the lesion.Remarkable relief is afforded to the hepatic symptoms by the
administration of digitalis.The important point in all cases due to
cardiac disease is to bring about compensation, and thus obviate the
consequences of the lesion.Remediable pulmonary affections should be
cured as promptly as possible, and the evil results of incurable
affections lessened by efforts to remove the hepatic hyperaemia.Careful alimentation, saline laxatives, and diuretics are the most
efficient measures.It would be encroaching on the subjects of
pulmonary and of cardiac diseases to enter more minutely into the
therapeutical questions connected with a symptom of these affections.DEFINITION.--By the term perihepatitis is meant an acute inflammation
of the serous envelope of the liver.It may be acute or chronic, very
rarely the latter, and it is usually a secondary affection, although
primary cases are not uncommon.PATHOGENY.--Inflammation of the hepatic portion of the peritoneum may
arise by an extension of the morbid process from neighboring parts, as
in perforation of the stomach or duodenum, pleuritis of that part of
the membrane reflected from the diaphragm, etc.More frequently it
arises by contiguity from some disease of the liver itself, as chronic
interstitial hepatitis, abscess, echinococci cysts, cancer, etc.The
author has frequently (comparatively) seen perihepatitis follow the
passage of gall-stones.It is usual to find considerable organized
exudation at the hilus of the liver in the case of those who have had
several attacks of hepatic colic, and attachments to various
neighboring parts also.In those instances of secondary hepatitis there
may be more or less extensive connective-tissue formation and
compression of the hepatic substance (Budd).[47]

[Footnote 47: _Diseases of the Liver_; also, Bamberger, _Krankheiten
des Chlylopoietic Systems_, p.Direct perihepatitis arises from traumatic causes--from contusions of
the right hypochondrium by spent balls, blows and falls, etc.Tight-lacing and wearing a strap to support the trousers are supposed
to excite a slow, chronic hepatitis, but the latter is more certain to
bring about such a result than the former.SYMPTOMS.--Acute perihepatitis, if of sufficient extent, causes more or
less fever; pain is felt in the right hypochondrium, and is increased
by pressure and by deep inspirations, and in some rare instances a
friction murmur is audible synchronous with the respiratory movements.These symptoms succeed to attacks of hepatic colic, perforation of the
stomach or intestine, and contusions of the abdominal wall.The chronic
form is not febrile; there is a feeling of soreness instead of acute
pain; pressure, the movements of the body, respiration, etc.increase
the distress, and on turning on the left side a painful dragging is
experienced.A slight degree of icterus may be present in both acute
and chronic cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of the acute cases is
toward recovery.In two or three days the inflammation reaches the
maximum, adhesions form, and then the morbid process declines.The
whole course of an acute perihepatitis caused by external injury or by
the passage of gall-stones is terminated in a week or ten days.The
mischief done may not be limited to the adhesions formed.The large
quantity of newly-organized connective tissue may, in its subsequent
contraction, compress the common, cystic, or hepatic duct, or the
portal, or both ducts and vein.The course of the chronic cases is
determined by the causative lesion.The contraction of the new-formed
connective tissue may compress the organ and lead to sclerotic changes
which cannot be distinguished from cirrhosis.In some instances
contusions set up suppurative inflammation, and an abscess forms
between the parietal and glandular layer of the peritoneum.Such a case
will then present the phenomena of hepatic abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the character of the case will be
{990} largely influenced by the history.If the attack has followed a
blow on the side or a paroxysm of hepatic colic or the symptoms of
perforation, there will be no difficulty in determining its seat and
character.In the absence of the history the differentiation must be
made between perihepatitis and pleuritis.The distinction consists in
the fact that in the former the pain and soreness are below the line of
respiratory sounds, although synchronous with them.In chronic
perihepatitis the symptoms come on in the course of the hepatic
disorder, or are consequent on a local injury, as the pressure of stays
or a band.TREATMENT.--If the symptoms are acute and the subject robust, the local
abstraction of blood by leeches affords relief and diminishes the
violence of the disease.A bandage should be tightly applied around the
body at the level of the hypochondrium to restrain the movements of the
affected organ.A turpentine stupe may be confined in this way, or a
compress of water may be utilized to serve the same purpose.If the
pain is acute and the peritonitis due to perforation or to the passage
of calculi, the hypodermatic injection of morphia is the most important
resource.Interstitial Hepatitis; Sclerosis of the Liver; Cirrhosis.DEFINITION.--The terms interstitial hepatitis and sclerosis of the
liver express the nature of the malady: they signify an inflammation of
the intervening connective tissue, resulting in a sclerosis--an
induration of the organ.The term cirrhosis, now so largely in use, was
originally proposed by Laennec[48] because of the yellowish tint of the
granulations, from the Greek word, [Greek: chirros], yellow.As
Laennec's theory of cirrhosis was erroneous, having regarded these
granulations as new formations, the word is a very faulty one, and
hence it would be preferable to use the term sclerosis, since a similar
change in other organs is thus designated, as sclerosis of the kidney,
sclerosis of the lungs, etc.It is also called in England gin-drinker's
liver, hobnail liver.Carswell[49] first described the anatomical
changes with accuracy, and illustrated them with correct drawings.The
following year Hallmann[50] confirmed the truth of Carswell's
descriptions, and contributed a good account of the morbid anatomy; and
subsequently French, German, and English authorities added new facts,
which will be set forth in the further discussion of the subject.[Footnote 48: _Traite de l'Auscultatlon mediate_, tome ii.[Footnote 49: _Illustrations of the Elementary Form of Diseases_,
fasciculus 10, plate 2.][Footnote 50: _De Cirrhosi hep._, Diss.Inaug., Berolini, 1839, quoted
by Thierfelder.]CAUSES.--Sclerosis of the liver is, conspicuously, a disease of adult
life and onward.Except the congenital example mentioned below, the
earliest age at which the disease has occurred, so far as I am able to
ascertain, is four years--a case reported by Wettergreen[51] of
hypertrophic sclerosis, in which neither a syphilitic nor paludal cause
could be ascertained.Cayley[52] reports a case in a child of six;
Murchison,[53] Frerichs,[54] Griffith,[55] one each at ten.After this
period the increase relatively to age is rapid.The majority of cases
occur between thirty {991} and fifty years.Yet Virchow[56] has given
the details of a congenital example.According to Forster, of 31 cases
of cirrhosis, 16 were between forty and sixty years.The preponderance
of cases in the male sex is very decided.Of Bamberger's 51 cases, 39
were men, 12 were women; of Frerichs' 36 cases, 20 occurred in men and
16 in women--a larger proportion of women than any other author
records; of 12 cases observed by myself, only 1 was a woman.Nationality does not affect the production of cirrhosis, except as
regards the personal habits of the people.This disease is
comparatively uncommon in wine- and beer-drinking countries, and
frequent amongst a spirit-drinking people.[57] The great etiological
factor is the abuse, the habitual use, of spirits, and hence the number
of cases observed in North Germany, England, Scotland, and the United
States.Murchison affirms that he has never seen a case produced in any
other way.Even in children of tender years the abuse of spirits can
usually be traced.Nevertheless, there are instances of the disease the
origin of which cannot be referred to alcoholic excess.The congenital
cases, as that narrated by Virchow, and the instances occurring in
children and adults not given to spirits in any form, indicate that
there are other pathogenetic influences which may bring about a
sclerosis of the liver.Virchow[58] was one of the first to illuminate
the subject of visceral syphilis and to demonstrate the occurrence of
sclerosis of the liver from syphilitic infection.Very often the
syphilitic cachexia coincides with alcoholic excess.There can be no
doubt that chronic malarial poisoning causes, or powerfully predisposes
to, cirrhosis.I have submitted elsewhere pathological evidence on this
point,[59] and the Italian physicians, who have the opportunity to
obtain accurate data, maintain that malarial toxaemia does bring about
this state.It is probable that the overgrowth of connective tissue is
induced by the repeated congestions of the malarial attacks, and by the
obstruction due to catarrh of the bile-ducts which so often occurs in
the febrile paroxysms.[Footnote 51: _Hygeia_, 1880, quoted by _London Medical Record_, March
15, 1881.][Footnote 52: _Transactions of the Path.[Footnote 53: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 54: _Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.[Footnote 55: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 56: _Archiv f. path.[Footnote 57: Baer, _Der Alcoholismus_, Berlin, 1878, p.62 _et seq._]

[Footnote 58: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.281; also, Lancereaux, _A
Treatise on Syphilis_, Syd.[Footnote 59: _Memoirs of the Sanitary Commission_, medical volume.]J. Wickham Legg[60] and Charcot[61] nearly simultaneously discovered
that obstruction of the bile-ducts, if continued a sufficient length of
time, sets up a hyperplasia of the connective tissue of the liver.Thus, Legg has seen a liver
markedly cirrhotic in a case where a small cancer of the duodenum
completely obstructed the flow of bile into the intestine.[62] By tying
the common duct in dogs it was found that a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue very soon occurred, and this was followed, of course,
by contraction of the new tissue and atrophy of the hepatic cells.Closure of the hepatic vein has the same effect, and also, as
Solowieff[63] has asserted, closure of the portal vein; on the other
hand, by Frerichs and others the closure of the portal is attributed to
the sclerosis.[Footnote 60: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.351 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 61: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.231 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 62: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.Anat., etc._, Band lxii.Certain poisons, as antimony, arsenic, notably phosphorus, have the
power to set up an irritative hyperplasia of the connective tissue of
the {992} liver.These metals accumulate in the liver in preparation
for excretion.Wegner,[64] in the study of the action of phosphorus on
dogs, rabbits, and other animals, has induced a marked degree of
sclerosis, but such results have not been observed in cases of
poisoning by phosphorus in man, except in an instance reported by
Kussner.[Footnote 64: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lv.Finally, a condition of the liver corresponding in all respects to
cirrhosis has been induced by perihepatitis, by the organization of the
exudation and its subsequent contraction, and by the extension of the
morbid process from the capsule to the interlobular connective tissue
(Poulin[65]).[Footnote 65: _Etude sur les Atrophies viscerales consecutives aux
Inflammations chroniques du Sereuses, etc._, These de Paris, 1880.]PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Several forms of cirrhosis are recognized by the
modern French school of pathologists.According to Sabourin,[66] there
is an annular, a monolobular, and a multilobular form.These differ
merely in regard to the arrangement of the new connective tissue.At
the outset of the disease the liver is increased in size and
hyperaemic.The outer
surface is at this period smooth, but on section the islets of the
parenchymatous tissue, yellowish in color, are distinctly visible
between the grayish or pale-rose tint of the intervening or
proliferating tissue.This reddish-gray material consists of fine
connective-tissue elements containing spindle-shaped cells.[67] The
development of this material is such as to even exceed in quantity the
proper glandular structure.The bands of newly-formed connective tissue
extend between individual lobules (monolobular cirrhosis) or between
groups of lobules (multilobular cirrhosis).A portion of the
spindle-shaped cells form new vessels communicating with the branches
of the hepatic artery.[68] Coincidently with the formation of the new
connective tissue ensues its contraction.The enlarged organ diminishes
in size from a slight degree to one-half its original volume;
especially in the left lobe is the diminution of size most marked.On
the surface it exhibits a knobbed or nodular aspect (hobnail liver),
and these knobs present through the capsule a yellow appearance.The
granulations, so called, consist of small prominences corresponding to
lobules or groups of lobules, and hence vary in size from that of a
pinhead to that of a pea.[69] Between these are the sharply-defined
masses of connective tissue.On section the organ is found to be of
firm almost cartilaginous hardness, and between the interlacing bundles
of connective tissue are the small islands of parenchymatous tissue
projecting above the cut surface and having a yellowish or
brownish-yellow color.As the terminal branches of the portal are
compressed in the process of shrinking undergone by the new connective
tissue, they are destroyed.The result of this obliteration of the
portal radicles is the impaired nutrition of the lobules and atrophy of
the cells.Formerly it was held that the atrophy of the hepatic cells
was due to the compression exercised by the contracting connective
tissue, and Beale[70] even maintained that the change began in {993}
the cells, the connective tissue contracting as the cells receded
before them.This view has been reaffirmed by Ackermann in a paper read
last year before the Congress of German Naturalists and Physicians, but
without any acknowledgment, so far as I can ascertain, of Beale's
long-before expressed opinions.In the discussion which followed the
reading of Ackermann's paper the position of its author was supported
by Aufrecht, Kussner, and others, but controverted by Rindfleisch.It
has been demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten[71] that the lobule is
nourished not only by the portal radicles, but by the branches of the
hepatic artery, which enter, by the interlobular vein, the capillaries
of the lobule, and hence the nutrition of the cells suffers in
consequence of the lessened blood-supply; but it is probable also that
more or less compression is exercised.When the cells are destroyed,
their remains may be discerned in the mass of connective tissue as fine
fat-granules or masses of pigment yellowish or brownish in color.The
peculiar appearance to which the name cirrhosis is applied is due to
the lobules or groups of lobules which project on section above the
divided surface, and are  yellowish by the bile-pigment, which
here exists in an exaggerated quantity.The cells themselves are not
normal: they are enlarged by compensatory hypertrophy, and they contain
much bile-pigment and a considerable quantity of fat.The compression
of the capillaries, especially their obliteration, leads to stasis of
the blood and its consequences in the whole chylopoietic system.Sabourin, "Du Role que joue le Systeme veineux

SYMPTOMS.--The development of sclerosis is usually very insidious.After some years' indulgence in spirit-drinking or affected for a
length of time with the other causes of the malady, a gradual decline
of vigor occurs.The complexion takes on a fawn color, stigmata slowly
form on the face, there is more or less yellowness of the conjunctiva,
and attacks of headache, giddiness, and even severe vertigo, are
experienced.An increasing indisposition to mental effort, some
hebetude of mind, and a gradually deepening despondency are felt.The
appetite gradually fails, becomes capricious, and only highly-seasoned,
rather odd, or unusual articles of food can be taken.Such subjects
acquire a taste for condiments, for such uncooked vegetables as onions,
celery, raw cabbage, etc., for fruits, and get a distaste for
plainly-cooked meats and vegetables, for sweets, etc.The digestion is
as capricious as the appetite: at first there are times of appetite,
again of indifference, then of disgust; some heaviness is felt after
meals; gaseous eructations, acidity, pyrosis, nausea, occur day after
day as the case advances; and ultimately morning vomiting is regularly
experienced.Nausea is felt on rising; then with much straining and
distress a little glairy mucus and a teaspoonful of bile are brought
up; after which, it may be, a little food can be taken.It is only
after the case is fully declared that these troubles of stomach
digestion become constant; previously they occur now and then in a
paroxysmal way, whilst between there is only labored digestion.As the compression of the portal radicles maintains, by reason of the
obstruction, a constant hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous membrane, a
catarrhal state, with fermentation of the fatty, starchy, and
saccharine constituents of the food, and hence complicated products of
an irritating kind, must result therefrom.Hemorrhoids, varying in size
according to {994} the degree of obstruction, form, sometimes bleeding
more or less profusely, again being merely troublesome or painful.Fissures of the anus and fistula in ano not unfrequently complicate the
case.The bowels are necessarily rather relaxed than confined, but at
the onset of the malady they may be confined, afterward assuming more
or less of the characteristics of diarrhoea.The stools may be
offensive with the products of decomposition, rather clay- or
golden, or brownish and almost black from the presence of blood.In
some cases the stools are parti---clay- in part, brownish
in part--and in exceptional examples continue normal or nearly so until
near the end.As the transudations from the portal vessels increase,
the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal becomes oedematous, and,
the normal secretions being arrested, the discharges finally consist of
a watery fluid, whitish or grayish, dark-brown or blackish, and very
offensive.The decomposition of foods instead of their proper digestion
and solution, and especially the fermentation of the starchy and
saccharine constituents of the aliment taken, produce a great quantity
of gas; hence meteorism comes to be an ordinary symptom.The
accumulation of gas is greatly promoted by the paretic state of the
muscular layer and by the relaxation of the abdominal walls consequent
on the oedema of the muscular tissue.A high degree of distress is
sometimes caused by the great accumulation of flatus; the abdomen is
greatly distended and the diaphragm is pushed up against the heart and
lungs, compelling the patient at length to sit up to breathe with ease.Of course the accumulation of fluid may be greater, and the gas only
add to the discomfort.Sometimes it happens, indeed, that
this is the only evidence of the portal obstruction at first observed.Haematemesis is more common than intestinal hemorrhage.Now the blood
may be large in quantity, appear little changed from its usual
coagulated state, and be brought up promptly with slight effort of
vomiting; now it is passed by stool, is in coffee-, granular
masses or in a tar-like, semifluid state; and again it appears in
coffee-grounds mixed with the contents of the stomach.These variations
are due to the character, seat, and extent of the hemorrhage and to the
condition of the mucous membrane.Merely-distended capillaries,
yielding, may furnish a little blood, which, acted on by the gastric
juice, forms coffee-grounds, or, if not acted on in consequence of the
failure of the gastric glands to functionate, appears as bloody streaks
mixed with mucus.Enlarged veins, giving way, may furnish a large
quantity of partly-coagulated venous blood, charred or not as the state
of the juices will determine.In some cases hemorrhages into the
submucous tissue or thromboses of the submucous veins lead to solution
of the membrane thus deprived of its nutritional supply, and ulcers
form.Two admirable examples of this kind have been seen by the writer
in which large haematemesis occurred from ulcers near the pylorus.They
were round, smooth ulcers, containing coagula, and the eroded vessels
(veins) were readily seen opening into the cavity of each.The obstruction to the portal circulation results also in an
enlargement of the spleen.There may be a simple enlargement due to the
hyperaemia merely; there may be an enlargement due to the hyperaemia
and to a resulting hyperplasia of the connective tissue; there may be
also, in {995} addition to the second form of enlargement, amyloid
degeneration, syphilitic hyperplasia, etc.The increased dimensions of
the spleen are by no means always made out, and authorities differ
greatly as to the proportion of cases in which the enlargement can be
detected.The organ may indeed be considerably enlarged whilst pushed
upward into the left hypochondrium by the effusion, and yet the attempt
to measure and define its dimensions may be fruitless.From a slight
increase due to the hyperaemia up to the enormous dimensions acquired
by the added amyloid material there are all possible variations in
size.Partly in consequence of the increased blood-pressure in the vessels of
the peritoneum, and partly in consequence of the watery condition of
the blood itself, effusion takes place into the sac of the peritoneum.Such an accumulation is known as ascites, or dropsy of the abdomen.The
time at which the effusion begins, the amount of it, and the degree of
contraction of the liver necessary to produce it, vary in each case.Ascites may be the first symptom to announce the onset of cirrhosis; it
is more frequently amongst the later symptoms, and is the evidence of
much interference in the portal circulation.However, it is not due
wholly to hepatic disease.The blood in cirrhosis is much reduced and
watery, hence slight causes suffice to induce an outward diffusion.Given a certain obstacle to the passage of the blood through the liver,
transudation will be the more prompt to appear the greater the anaemia.In some cases an enormous quantity of fluid collects: from ten to
thirty pounds may be regarded as usual, and forty to sixty pounds as
exceptional, although the highest amount just given is not rare.The
fluid of ascites nearly represents the serum of the blood.It has a
straw color and is clear, but it may have a reddish tint from the
presence of blood, a greenish-yellow or brown from bile-pigment.The
solids of the serum are in the proportion of from 1 to 3 per cent., and
consist of albumen chiefly and salts, of which sodium chloride is the
principal.Hoppe's[72] analysis gives this result: 1.55 to 1.75 solids,
of which 0.62 to 0.77 is albumen.According to Frerichs, the amounts of
solids ranges from 2.04 to 2.48, and of these albumen constitutes 1.01
to 1.34.[Footnote 72: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band ix.]Oedema of the inferior extremities comes on after, usually--rarely
with--the ascites.If the mechanism of this oedematous swelling be as
supposed, the effusion into the areolar tissue necessarily succeeds to
the abdominal effusion.The pressure of the fluid in the cavity on the
ascending vena cava and iliac veins seems to be the principal factor;
but to this must also be added the intestinal gas, which in some
instances exerts a powerful force.The ankles have in rather rare cases
appeared swollen before the abdomen, but the detection of fluid in the
peritoneal cavity when in small quantity is not always easy.Obese
women, with much accumulation of fat in the omentum and flatus in the
intestines, have swollen feet and legs if erect for some time, the
effusion being due to pressure on the vena cava.The legs may become
enormously distended.The scrotum and penis in the male, the vulva in
the female, the buttocks and the abdominal wall, also become
oedematous, sometimes immensely.Warmth and moisture and the friction of the sensitive surfaces excite
vesicular and pustular eruptions where the {996} scrotum and labiae
come in contact with the thighs.Urination may be impeded by the oedema
of the prepuce.An attempt at compensation for these evils growing out of the
obstruction in the portal system is made by the natural powers.Anastomoses of veins through minute branches are made use of to convey
the blood of the obstructed portal circulation into the general venous
system, and to this end become greatly enlarged.The interlobular veins
being obliterated by the contracting connective tissue, the pressure in
the branches and trunk of the portal vein is much increased.Hence an
outlet is sought for in the veins which communicate between the portal
and the ascending vena cava.One of the most important of these is a
vein in the round ligament, at one time supposed to be the closed
umbilical vein, but proved by Sappey to be an accessory portal vein.Bamberger,[73] however, has found the umbilical vein pervious, and
since, Hoffmann[74] has demonstrated the same fact.It is probable,
indeed, that Sappey's observation is correct for some cases.In either
event, the veins of the abdominal wall about the umbilicus
communicating with the epigastric become enormously distended, and in
some advanced cases of cirrhosis form a circle known as the caput
Medusae.Further communication between the portal and the veins of the
diaphragm takes place by means of the veins in the coronary and
suspensory ligaments.In some instances a new route is established
between the veins of the diaphragm and the portal by means of new
vessels formed in the organized connective tissue resulting from
perihepatitis.Still another channel of communication exists between
the inferior oesophageal veins, the azygos, and the coronary, and
finally between the inferior hemorrhoidal and the hypogastric.The more
completely can communication be established between these anastomosing
veins the less severe the results of portal obstruction.[Footnote 73: _Krankheiten des Chylopoiet.cit._]

[Footnote 74: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

Besides these indirect evidences of portal obstruction and a
contracting organ, there are direct means of ascertaining the condition
of the liver.By the methods of physical diagnosis we may acquire much
information.On auscultation, as our Jackson[75] was the first to show,
a grating or creaking like leather, or friction sound, is audible over
the right hypochondrium synchronously with the respiratory movements or
when produced by moving with the fingers the abdominal wall on the
liver.This sound is caused by the bands of false membrane which extend
between the two surfaces, and hence indicates a secondary
perihepatitis.[Footnote 75: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850.]To ascertain the dimensions of the liver--to mark out the area of
hepatic dulness--with accuracy is a most necessary procedure.The
period of the disease is an important element in the problem.When the
new material is deposited and the congestion of the portal system first
occurs, an increase in the dimensions of the organ is observed.This
enlargement, of brief duration, must not be confounded with the
hypertrophic sclerosis, another form of the malady.So considerable is
the increase in the size of the liver that there is an evident
enlargement of the right hypochondrium, and the whole abdomen seems
fuller.The organ may be felt, on palpation, projecting one, two, or
even three fingers' breadths below the margin of the ribs, and the left
lobe extends well across the epigastrium, increasing the sense of
resistance and the area {997} of dulness in this direction.The
enlarged liver, as felt below the ribs, appears firmer than is natural,
is yet smooth, and the margin is sharply defined.The duration of this
period of enlargement is indefinite, but it is rather brief, and is
followed by the contracting and atrophic stage.It is not often,
indeed, that the patient presents himself during the period of
enlargement.Sometimes a perihepatitis or an unwonted tenderness in the
right side compels attention during this stage, but more frequently it
escapes notice.If perihepatitis occur, there will be fever, pain, and
tenderness, a slight icterode hue of the skin, and possibly
Jackson's[76] friction sound.These symptoms, taken in conjunction with
the history of the case and the obvious enlargement of the organ, will
indicate the existence of the first stage of sclerosis.[Footnote 76: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850, _supra_.]The contraction of the liver, or, as it may be expressed, the atrophy
of the hepatic cells and the consequent shrinking of the interlobular
connective tissue, goes on slowly.Several months may be occupied in an
amount of atrophy distinct enough to be recognized by the narrowing of
the area of hepatic dulness.Especially difficult is the recognition of
the contraction when ascites has fully distended the abdomen.It may be
necessary under such circumstances to postpone a decision until tapping
has removed the fluid.If the organ can be felt by depressing the walls
of the abdomen, more or less unevenness of surface may be detected, and
the inferior margin may give the impression of hardness and sharpness
of outline.At the same time, the increased dulness of the epigastric
region observed during the hypertrophic stage will have gradually
ceased because of the shrinking of the left lobe.The liver may be
undergoing the atrophic degeneration to a marked extent and yet remain
large--larger even than normal.Such a state of things may be due to
conjoint amyloid or fatty degeneration of the organ, and, indeed, more
or less fatty change occurs in all cases of cirrhosis.The shrinking of
the liver persists until the area of dulness is not greater in area
than two or three ribs.The disturbances of function in sclerosis of the liver are not limited
to the chylopoietic system.As the secreting structure of the liver is
continually lessened in extent by the atrophy, symptoms result from the
necessary interference in the hepatic functions.These symptoms are
concerned with the liver, with the nutrition of the tissues of the
body, and with the kidneys.As regards the biliary function of the
liver, the quantity of bile acids and pigment is reduced below the
normal in proportion to the damage done to the organ.As a rule, there
is little jaundice in sclerosis, and very little bile-pigment present
in the urine.Instead of a
jaundiced hue of the skin, it has a fawn color--an earthy, sallow tint
eminently characteristic of a chronic affection in which the power to
produce bile is much impaired.Occasionally it happens, particularly in
the early stages of cirrhosis, that a well-marked jaundice appears in
the face and body, but this probably is due to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.In most cases the integument presents the earthy and sallow
hue above mentioned.Graves[77] appears to have been the first to
interpret aright the greater significance of this appearance of the
skin than the purely jaundiced tint.The glycogenic {998} function of
the liver must be impaired in the same ratio as the biliary.The
nutrition of the body suffers; the skin becomes dry and harsh; the fat
disappears; the temperature of the body, unless the conditions for
producing fever are present, is barely up to normal, if not somewhat
below; a marked degree of anaemia supervenes; and the action of the
heart becomes feeble and rapid after a period of slowness.The blood is
altered in quality, and hence hemorrhages--epistaxis especially--occur,
petechiae and ecchymoses appear in the skin, and stigmata are numerous
about the face and nose.[Footnote 77: _Clinical Medicine_, _op.cit._]

The urine in cirrhosis is high- because of the abundance of
pigment, and in the early stages of the disease is increased in amount,
although of lower specific gravity.When much effusion takes place into
the peritoneal sac, the compression of the renal veins by the fluid
lessens the activity of the kidneys and diminishes the urinary flow.Much discussion has taken place over the quantity of urea present in
the urine in cases of cirrhosis, but it has been established that the
relative quantity of urea lessens in proportion to the damage suffered
by the liver.[78] The urates are in excess.[Footnote 78: Charcot, _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, _loc.252; also, _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree dans les Maladies du
Foie_, par F. Genevoix, Paris, 1876; _Des Rapports de l'Uree avec le
Foie_, par A. Martin, Paris, 1877; _Sur l'Uree et ces Variations dans
la Cirrhose_, These de Paris, Audiguier; _Contribution a l'Etude du
Role du Foie dans la Product.de l'Uree_, Reufflet.]COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--There are enormous variations in
the course of the disease as respects the rate of its progress.In
general, it may be said that the whole duration is from three months to
six years.The onset is often insidious, and little distress is
occasioned until effusion begins in the abdomen.In other cases there
is considerable pain in the right hypochondrium, severe disorders of
digestion and intestinal derangements, rapid emaciation, ascites, and
some intercurrent malady which terminates them, often quite
unexpectedly.The usual course is as follows: After the protracted use
of alcoholic stimulants the symptoms of gastro-intestinal catarrh
appear; there occur acidity, pyrosis, morning vomiting, and distress
after meals; the bowels are irregular, the stools rather dark and
offensive; the bodily vigor declines and the mental condition is
depressed and hypochondriacal; emaciation progresses; the skin becomes
dry, harsh, and fawn-; stigmata appear on the face; some
uneasiness is felt in the abdomen, through the right hypochondrium, and
about the umbilicus; presently the abdomen enlarges and the feet and
legs swell; after a time the abdominal enlargement is extreme and the
walls become thin, the genitals and thighs are greatly distended, and
the prepuce is so swollen that urination grows more and more difficult,
the penis almost disappearing in the surrounding oedema;
notwithstanding the immense size of the abdomen and lower extremities,
the chest, face, and upper extremities are wasted away; to lie down is
impossible, and only snatches of disturbed sleep are procured in the
upright sitting posture; breathing grows more and more difficult, and a
sense of suffocation is imminent; and, thus worn out by suffering and
want of sleep, the patient at last sinks into a soporose state and dies
comatose, if not cut off before by some acute serous
inflammation--pleuritis, peritonitis, peri- or endocarditis, pneumonia,
etc.{999} The course of any case of cirrhosis is much influenced by the
amount of damage to the hepatic cells and by the extent of the
compensatory changes in the circulation.Ulcers of the stomach or
intestine, opening vessels, or hemorrhages from the mucous membranes
may have a pronounced effect on the progress of any case.A fatal
result was determined in a case under the writer's charge by hemorrhage
from ulcers near the pylorus, which were caused by thromboses of the
stomach veins at that point.Occasionally, the occurrence of thrombosis
of the portal vein adds an embarrassing and dangerous complication.The
liver, besides the change due to cirrhosis, may be affected by amyloid
or fatty degeneration, or by both combined.It should not be forgotten
that more or less fatty change takes place in the hepatic cells
undergoing atrophy, whence the appearance called cirrhosis.Sclerosis
may be a general condition in which several organs participate, the
kidneys notably.These organs are changed by a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue, and especially by fatty degeneration of the
epithelium.In the brain the sclerosis consists in chronic
pachymeningitis, adhesions of the dura, etc., and with these
connective-tissue changes are often associated extravasations of blood.These lesions are probably due to chronic alcoholism rather than to the
cirrhosis--are simultaneous lesions, instead of consecutive.The duration of cirrhosis must necessarily depend largely on the
occurrence of the complications above mentioned and on the appearance
of intercurrent diseases.The most usual intercurrent maladies are
peritonitis, pleuritis, and other serous inflammations.An attack of
cerebral (meningeal) hemorrhage may occur.Failure of the heart may be
due to fatty degeneration of its muscular tissue.Stupor, coma, and
insensibility may come on toward the close in consequence of the
retention of excrementitious matters.By Flint, Jr., these cerebral
symptoms were referred to the retained cholesterin, and hence he
designated this state cholesteraemia.Numerous experimentalists
(Pages,[79] Chomjakow,[80] Von Krusenstern,[81] Koloman Muller[82])
have studied this question, and only Muller has been able to confirm
Flint's theory.The condition is more suitably designated cholaemia,
which signifies blood-poisoning from the excrementitious biliary
matters retained in the system.[Footnote 79: Quoted by Legg, p.[Footnote 80: Quoted by Krusenstern.][Footnote 81: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxv.[Footnote 82: _Archiv fur experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie_,
Band i. p.Any fully-developed case of cirrhosis can only terminate in one way,
for we possess no means of restoring the hepatic cells when once
destroyed.At the outset of the disease, before any serious changes
have taken place, it is probable it may be arrested.Proceeding to its
natural termination without complications or intercurrent affections,
death finally occurs from exhaustion.The emaciation becomes extreme,
the stomach gets to be excessively irritable, and an exhausting
diarrhoea consumes the last remains of strength.Then an oedema of the
lungs or failure of the heart or a deep coma ends the scene.DIAGNOSIS.--Cirrhosis in its first stage is to be distinguished from
diseases which cause enlargement of the liver, and in its second or
contracting stage from diseases that induce contraction of the organ.The history of alcoholic excess is an important means of
differentiating this {1000} from other affections.The enlargement
belonging to alcoholism is distinguished from that due to amyloid
disease by the permanent character of the latter and by its history of
chronic suppuration, in addition to, it may be, alcoholic excess; from
cancer, by the character of the enlargement, by its permanence, by the
secondary deposits in the mesentery and elsewhere, by the severe and
persistent pain; from hydatids or echinococci cysts by the painless
enlargement of the latter, by the absence, usually, of any interference
with the hepatic functions, by the purring thrill, and by the presence
of the characteristic hooklets in the fluid withdrawn.From the
maladies characterized by the contraction of the organ it is
distinguished by the rapidity with which the case is developed in acute
yellow atrophy, and by the profound constitutional disturbance
characteristic of this form of contraction.When the liver is lessened
in size in consequence of the compression exercised by the contracting
exudation of a local peritonitis, there is a history of pain and
soreness of the right hypochondrium, followed by the symptoms of
contraction--a very different history from that of cirrhosis, in which
the local attacks of pain and distress succeed to or accompany the
symptoms of contraction.Occlusion of the gall-ducts by a calculus may
set up a slow atrophy having some points of resemblance to cirrhosis;
but in this malady attacks of hepatic colic precede the signs of
obstruction, the jaundice, and gray evacuations, and the evidences of
contraction succeed to these very characteristic symptoms; whereas in
cirrhosis paroxysms of pain followed by jaundice are not known.Occlusion of the portal vein may also be followed by atrophy, but this
is usually due to some other affection of the abdominal organs, and the
change in the condition of the liver occurs very promptly, there being
neither the history nor the course of symptoms belonging to cirrhosis.TREATMENT.--As the abuse of alcoholic liquors--even their habitual use
in moderation--is the chief pathogenetic factor, they should be
entirely given up.Condiments, coffee and tea, highly-seasoned animal
foods, are of less importance as causes, but are sufficiently injurious
to require them to be discontinued.The food of such subjects should
not contain fat, because the bile is necessary to its right
assimilation, and should have but a small proportion relatively of
starch and sugar, since these articles readily ferment in the presence
of an excess of mucus and in the absence of the bile.The succulent
vegetables, as lettuce, celery, spinach, etc., should be substituted
for the starchy and saccharine.A diet largely composed of skimmed milk
renders an important service both as a nutrient and a diuretic and
depurant.Lean meats, acid fruits, and the weak alkaline mineral waters
should be the basis of a proper system of alimentation.As malarial intoxication is a cause now distinctly recognized, patients
should be removed from such influences.If this be impracticable, the
effects of the poison should, as far as possible, be removed,
especially the glandular complications.To this end, such remedies
should be employed as will affect the overgrowth of the connective
tissue, as the compound solution of iodine, the bichloride of mercury,
and the chloride of gold (or gold and sodium).Quinine will be
necessary, according to circumstances.Do we possess any means to check the overgrowth of connective tissue
{1001} in cases of sclerosis?The writer believes that those remedies
have this power to a less or greater extent which are separated by the
liver from the blood.These are chiefly the salts of gold, silver,
copper, arsenic, and mercury (chloride), and phosphorus.The most
useful of these are the chloride of gold and sodium and the chloride of
mercury, and some phosphates.The writer has had, he thinks, curative
results in the commencement of the disease from the chloride of gold
and sodium and the phosphate of sodium.German practitioners believe
that the chloride of ammonium is a powerful alterant and deobstruent,
and prescribe it in this affection to stop the overgrowth of connective
tissue.That it does have this effect can hardly be disputed, but the
daily quantity necessary is large, the taste very disagreeable, and the
stomachal effect that of an irritant.Hence it is by no means so
effective as the chlorides above mentioned.The chloride of gold and
sodium (1/10 grain) can be given at the same time with chloride of
mercury (1/20 grain) if it is desirable to combine their effects.The
writer has seen what appeared to be cases of cirrhosis in the first
stage yield to the persistent administration of phosphate of
sodium--drachm j ter in die--and the chloride of gold and sodium.When contraction of the liver has ensued, and hemorrhages, effusion
into the cavity of the peritoneum, and a high degree of
gastro-intestinal catarrh have occurred, the relief of the secondary
symptoms takes the first place in importance.There are but three modes
by which an effusion into the abdomen can be removed: by the skin, by
the kidneys, by the intestinal canal.Each of these may be employed in
turn.By the skin warm baths, vapor baths, digitalis stupes, and
especially the subcutaneous injection of pilocarpin, may be employed.These alone may be sufficient in some cases--rather rarely, however.They may all be used simultaneously or in turn to effect the purpose.A
digitalis stupe may be made to have the effect of a vapor bath: a large
one is placed on the abdomen and the body is covered with blankets,
which results in the production of abundant sweating.The vapor bath is
applied in the ordinary way, so that no explanation is needed.If there
be no contraindication in the state of the heart, pilocarpin salts can
be injected in sufficient quantity to induce active diaphoresis.These
measures proving inadequate, an attempt should be made to dispose of
the fluid by acting on the kidneys and promoting diuresis.Amongst the
diuretics in ascites, Wilks places the resin of copaiba first.The dose
ranges from two to five grains, and it may be given in combination with
gold or mercury chloride.When this remedy increases the flow of urine,
it does good, but if the quantity of urine remains unchanged, it does
no good, and should be discontinued.As the effusion of fluid is due to the portal obstruction, it follows
that depletion of the terminal radicles of this system will act most
directly on the origin of the troubles.Hydragogue cathartics have,
therefore, an important place in the treatment of ascites of hepatic
origin.One of the most generally efficient of these remedies is the
compound jalap powder, for whilst it produces free watery evacuations,
it also stimulates the kidneys somewhat.It is generally better to give
a full dose--one or two teaspoonfuls--in the early morning, so that the
disturbance caused by it will subside before the time for taking food.Several free watery evacuations should be produced by it.Sometimes the
resin or extract of podophyllin is added to the compound jalap powder
to increase its activity.{1002} Purgative combinations of colocynth,
gamboge, and resin of podophyllin are also occasionally employed, but
the most efficient hydragogue is elaterium.The last-mentioned may act
very efficiently without causing any considerable depression, but the
results obtained by it are usually fleeting.After even a very free
discharge of fluid the effusion quickly increases, and further
purgation is required.Tapping is a palliative expedient which must
sometimes be considered.With the present improved aspirator and the
antiseptic method the fluid may be withdrawn with ease and safety.It
is not necessary in any case to remove all the fluid--merely that
quantity which will relieve the pressure on the diaphragm and on the
renal vessels.The author has seen general peritonitis result from
tapping.As such a complication will increase all the difficulties of a
case, it is very desirable to prevent it by careful application of the
antiseptic method and sealing of the punctured orifice to prevent the
entrance of germs.In the protracted cases of cirrhosis there ensues, finally, a highly
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane, the bowels become very
irritable, and frequent offensive and watery discharges occur.If under
these circumstances the abdominal effusion increases, the remedies must
consist of diuretics and diaphoretics rather than purgatives.Indeed,
an exhaustive colliquative diarrhoea may require bismuth, copper, and
other astringents, combined with opium, to prevent the patient passing
into the condition of collapse.Hemorrhage by vomiting or by stool will
demand ice, subsulphate of iron, ipecac, ergotin in the form of
subcutaneous injection especially, and other remedies which have been
found useful in gastric or intestinal hemorrhage.Topical remedies are not without utility if used early.When the
changes in the liver are secondary to peritonitis of the hepatic
portion, the application of leeches and cups renders an important
service.At any time during the course of cirrhosis wet or dry cups may
be used with advantage whenever local pain, tenderness, and a catching
respiration indicate the extension of mischief to the peritoneum.The
tincture of iodine or flying blisters, or both in turn, may be applied
over the right hypochondrium after cups and leeches, or at any time
when local distress indicates the need of counter-irritants.Probably
the most efficient topical application during the hypertrophic stage of
cirrhosis is the official ung.A piece the size
of a large pea should be thoroughly rubbed in over the hepatic region
daily until some irritation of the skin is produced.When this
irritation has subsided the applications should be renewed.Suppurative Hepatitis; Abscess of the Liver.DEFINITION.--Suppurative hepatitis is an acute inflammation of the
hepatic parenchyma, terminating in suppuration.The inflammation may be
primary or due to local conditions entirely, or it may arise from
morbid processes occurring in parts or organs in anatomical relation to
the liver.CAUSES.--Climate exercises an unquestionable influence in the
production of hepatic abscess.Those warm countries visited by
dysentery, {1003} says Lombard,[83] are almost exclusively affected by
this disease.Hirsch,[84] whilst recognizing the influence of climate,
shows that the natives are not affected to the same extent as are
Europeans.Both writers maintain that hepatic abscess does not occur
frequently in the corresponding parallels of latitude in the United
States; which is true of the Atlantic border, but is not correct for
the interior continent, the valley of the Mississippi, and its
tributaries.In this vast region the conditions for the production of
hepatitis exist abundantly.The mean annual temperature, the
malaria-breeding soil, the social and personal habits of the people
(males), combine to favor the production of hepatic abscess.As the
native population and females in tropical countries are not affected,
there must be other influences to the action of which the high
temperature contributes.The rich and highly-seasoned food in which
Europeans indulge and the large consumption of alcoholic drinks are
doubtless responsible in a large measure for the occurrence of this
malady in such excessive proportions amongst them.[Footnote 83: _Traite de Climatologie medicale_, tome iv.[Footnote 84: _Handbuch der historisch-geographischen Pathologie_, Band
ii.Sex has a remarkable influence in securing immunity against hepatic
abscess.According to the statistics of Rouis,[85] of 258 cases of
hepatic abscess, only 8 were in women.He rightly enough attributes
this exemption rather to the difference in habits of the two sexes than
to any merely sexual peculiarity.In 12 cases observed by the writer,
only 1 was in a woman.In Waring's[86] collection of 300 fatal cases of
tropical dysentery, only 9 occurred in women.These facts are most
conclusive regarding the relatively greater frequency of the affection
in men.As might be expected, the age at which this disease occurs is
the period of adult life, when exposure to the conditions developing it
is most likely to happen.In general, then, hepatic abscess may be
referred to the period mentioned by Rouis--from twelve to seventy-five
years of age.In my own cases the youngest was eleven years and the
oldest fifty-four years of age.It is not the broken-down subject of
mature age or the weakling of youth who is attacked by hepatic abscess,
but the more vigorous and able-bodied, who have, because of their
strength and activity, been exposed to the manifold conditions
producing it.[Footnote 85: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie
d'apres des Observations recueilles dans le Nord de l'Afrique_, par J.
L. Rouis, Paris, 1860, p.[Footnote 86: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology of Some
Points connected with Abscess of the Liver_, by Ed.John Waring,
Resident Surgeon of Travancore, 1854, p.Rouis finds that a combination of the lymphatic and nervous
temperaments seems most favorable to the production of this malady.It
is certain that those who have the bodily conditions influential in the
formation of gall-stones are not unfrequently attacked by abscess.The
passage of the calculi may induce a local peritonitis of considerable
severity; their arrest in the duct, with the result of ulcerating
through, producing peritonitis and adhesions, are conditions
eventuating in the formation of an abscess always large and sometimes
of enormous size.Under such circumstances the element of temperament
has a secondary place in the aggregate of causes.Not very often hepatic abscess results from external blows, contusions,
and from penetrating wounds.The liver is so placed as to glide aside
when a blow is inflicted on the right hypochondrium, and thus escapes
{1004} direct compression.An injury which elsewhere would have but
little effect may excite suppurative inflammation in the tropical--or,
as it may be entitled, the hepatic--abscess zone.Climatic conditions,
or the changed habits of Europeans in tropical and subtropical regions,
exert a distinct influence in traumatic cases.The most important causes of hepatic abscess exist in the state of the
portal vein, hepatic artery, and the hepatic veins.In the valley of
the Mississippi and its tributaries, where abscess of the liver is a
comparatively common disease, it has been found that in a large
proportion of the cases the initial stage is an affection of the
rectum--a form of dysentery properly entitled proctitis.So far as this
vast region is concerned, the intestinal disease which precedes abscess
of the liver, and stands in a causative relation to it, is an affection
of the mucous membrane from which the inferior hemorrhoidal veins
arise.This disease, although having a dysenteric form, is not ordinary
dysentery.The onset of the disease and its symptomatic expression are
those of a mild affection of the mucous membrane of the rectum--so
insignificant in some cases as to be recalled with difficulty.In
tropical countries abscess of the liver may be associated with
dysenteric ulcerations.This relation has been frequently observed, but
is far from constant.In Waring's[87] cases, which occurred in India,
31 per cent.of the fatal cases of hepatic abscess arose during the
course of acute or chronic dysentery.De Castro of Alexandria[88] finds
that dysentery is the most frequent cause of abscess in that region,
especially in the Greek hospital.Murchison[89] considers tropical
abscess of the liver as secondary to dysentery in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but by no means in all.In non-tropical
countries abscess of the liver is found to succeed to ulcerations of
the stomach, the intestines, the bile-ducts, etc.In the case of
ulceration of any part of the mucous membrane from which the portal
vein receives branches a morbific material may be conveyed to the
liver.This morbific material may be some unknown septic principle the
presence of which in the liver will excite suppurative inflammation; it
may consist of an embolus having septic power or a merely mechanical
irritant; it may be micrococci or some other living organisms, which,
arrested in the portal radicles, set up inflammatory foci, etc.There
are many examples of hepatic abscess connected with dysenteric
ulcerations of the intestine in which no embolus can be found.Admitting the presence of the embolus originally, its disappearance is
readily understood by reference to the changes induced by suppuration.Excepting these cases there must be many in which no embolus can be
found, because none existed; an unknown septic substance has excited
the suppurative inflammation.Emboli may be lodged in the liver from
thrombi formed in the peripheral distribution of the portal vein, or
from distant parts of the systemic circulation, as in bone diseases.There has been no satisfactory explanation of the manner in which such
emboli pass the pulmonary capillaries to be lodged in the liver.At one
time there was supposed to be a special relation between injuries of
the bones of the head and hepatic abscess, but it is now known {1005}
that these cases are not more numerous than those due to osteo-myelitis
in any situation.Abscesses in the lungs are greatly more frequent than
in the liver in cases of this kind.According to Waldeyer,[90] whilst
in two-thirds of the cases of death from surgical diseases and injuries
there were abscesses in the lungs, in only 6 per cent.were there
abscesses of the liver.It is evident that the emboli entering the
systemic circulation are usually arrested in the pulmonary capillaries.Klebs maintains that such emboli consist of parasitic organisms.[Footnote 87: _On Abscess of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 88: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur Traitement
chirurgical_, par le Dr.S. V. Castro (d'Alexandrie d'Egypte).][Footnote 89: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.[Footnote 90: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xl.Dilatation and ulceration of the bile-ducts were the principal causes
of hepatic abscess, as ascertained by Von Baerensprung, in the Berlin
Pathological Institute.Duodenal catarrh involving the orifice of the
common duct, catarrh of the biliary passages leading to obstruction,
and plugging with a gall-stone have resulted in abscess, the initial
lesion being probably rupture of one or more of the finer tubes or
inflammation leading to suppuration.[91]

[Footnote 91: Grainger Stewart, _The Edinburgh Medical Journal_,
January, 1873.]Finally, a considerable proportion of cases of hepatic abscess arise
under unknown conditions.In such cases, however, it is usually found
that there has been more or less indulgence in alcoholic drinks, or the
liver has been taxed by excesses in the use of rich foods and
condiments, or exposure to extreme degrees of temperature has occurred.In the interior valley of this continent, where hepatic abscess is
comparatively common, the causes are to be found in malarial
influences, in alcoholic indulgence, in dysenteric attacks the product
of climatic variations and improper alimentation, and in the formation
and arrest in transitu of hepatic calculi also the result of
long-continued gastro-duodenal and biliary catarrh.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Great differences of opinion have been expressed
as to the initial lesions in hepatic abscess.It is probable, however,
that these differences are due to the character of the abscess.Some
have their origin in the hepatic cells, others in the connective
tissue, and others still in the vessels.There may be a number of
points at which the suppurative process begins, or it may be limited to
one.Virchow[92] describes the initial lesion as beginning in the
cells, which first become coarsely granular, then opaque, and finally
soften, and pus appears.Klebs, who maintains the constant agency of
septic micrococci, affirms that the changes in the cells are due to
compression exerted by the mass of these organisms distending the
neighboring vessels, and then suppuration begins on the portal side of
the lobules.Liebermeister originally held that the initial lesion is
in the connective tissue; and this view is also supported by Koster,
who brings to bear experimental data.In the walls of the vessels of
the connective tissue and about them, between the hepatic cells, great
numbers of lymphoid cells accumulate.The intercellular spaces are also
distended with plasma and round cells, and in the vicinity of the
central vein the swollen hepatic cells are pressed together; soon
pus-corpuscles appear, and the proper anatomical elements are broken up
into a diffluent mass composed of fat-granules, pus-corpuscles, and
disintegrating hepatic cells.[Footnote 92: _Archiv fur path.When suppurative hepatitis arises from an embolus, or emboli, the
{1006} first step is the change in the appearance of the acini, which
are enlarged and grow softer by disintegration of their cells; then at
the centre a yellowish spot appears, and is made up of the detritus,
granules of fat, and pus.Surrounding such softening portions of the
hepatic tissue is a zone of congestion.When the morbid processes are
excited by emboli, there will be as many centres of pus-formation as
there are particles distributed by the vessels--from two or three to
fifty or more.They may be uniformly distributed through the organ or
be collected in one part.Emboli conveyed by the portal vein will be
arranged with a certain regularity and through the substance of the
liver, whilst those coming from some part of the systemic circulation
tend to form at the periphery under the capsule.Small abscesses in
close proximity unite ultimately by the softening and disintegration of
the intervening tissue.In the so-called tropical abscess, which is the variety so frequently
met with in the interior of this country, the mode of development is
different from the embolic, above described.Owing to the deposit of
some morbific matter whose nature is now unknown, the vessels dilate
and hyperaemia of the part to become the seat of suppuration ensues.The cells become cloudy, granular, and opaque from the deposit of an
albuminous matter in them.Within the area of congestion a yellowish
spot soon appears, surrounded by a translucent, pale-gray ring, and
here suppuration begins; the neighboring cells disintegrate and a
purulent collection is formed, which enlarges by the destruction in
succession of the adjacent portions of hepatic tissue.Whilst this
process is going on there is a border of deep congestion about the
abscess, fading off gradually into the normal tint of the hepatic
parenchyma; the walls of the abscess are rough and irregular from
projections of tissue just beginning to disintegrate, and the pus
burrows in various directions more or less deeply into the softening
parts.The size to which such purulent collections attain is largely
determined by the condition of the liver as a whole.If the organ
attacked is healthy otherwise and the general health is not
deteriorated, the area of the abscess may be limited by a well-defined
membrane and continue inactive for a long time.This limiting membrane
is of inflammatory origin, developed from the connective tissue, and
varies in thickness from a mere line to several.It was formerly called
a pyogenic membrane, because the pus discharged was supposed to be
formed by it.When such a limiting inflammation cannot take place, the
abscess continually enlarges by the softening and destruction of the
adjacent hepatic tissue, and may finally attain to enormous
proportions.The embolic abscesses vary in size from that of a pea to
that of an orange.The so-called tropical abscesses are usually
single--in three-fourths of the cases, according to Rouis;[93] in 62.1
per cent., according to Waring.[94] Of the fatal cases collected by the
latter author, 285 in number, a single abscess existed in 177, and
multiple abscesses in 108.there were two abscesses; in
3.6 per cent., three; and in 5.6 per cent.As regards the part of the liver in which abscess occurs, the
statistics show a great preponderance in favor of the right lobe.In
Waring's collection of 300 cases the right lobe was the {1007} seat of
the abscess in 163, or 67.3 per cent.; the left lobe was affected in
16, or 6.6 per cent.; and both lobes in 35, or 14.4 per cent.The
preponderance of cases affecting the right lobe is the more striking
when it is understood that, other parts being invaded, the right is
included with them in the morbid process.In my own cases the right
lobe was the seat of the abscess in 70 per cent.[Footnote 93: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie_,
_loc.[Footnote 94: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.connected with Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.The contents of the abscesses are affected in character by the form of
the disease, whether embolic or tropical, by its rate of development,
by the condition of the hepatic parenchyma, by the formation of a
limiting membrane, etc.In the more chronic cases, surrounded by a
dense membrane, the pus is usually laudable or dry and cheesy; in the
acute embolic cases the pus is dark brown, ichorous or grumous, and
contains a good deal of detritus of the hepatic parenchyma; and in the
tropical cases it is of a sanguinolent, dark color, or more frequently
of a grayish purulent fluid; and in the acute forms contains much
broken-down tissue, whilst in the chronic cases, in direct ratio to
their duration, the pus approaches the laudable character.The source
of an abscess discharging from the neighborhood of the liver may be
ascertained by a microscopical examination and the discovery of the
hepatic elements (the cells) in the fluid.Bile may also be present in
the pus.The abscesses not confined by a limiting membrane constantly enlarge by
the softening and disintegration of the adjacent liver substance, and
those enclosed or encysted after a period of quiescence of variable
duration begin active efforts to establish communication outwardly.The
point to which a purulent collection in the liver tends becomes an
important element in diagnosis and in treatment.As the abscess
approaches the surface of the liver the capsule inflames, and if
adhesions are not formed more or less sloughing occurs, and the
contents are discharged into the abdominal cavity.Adhesions may form
to the parietes, an external swelling appear, and after a time
discharge take place in the right hypochondrium at some point.Pus may
escape at the umbilicus, in the right inguinal region, posteriorly at
the sacro-iliac junction, and in other situations.Adhesions may form
to the stomach, duodenum, the ascending vena cava, to the diaphragm
opening the thoracic cavity, the pericardium, or the mediastinum; and
the accumulated pus may thus find a vent.According to Waring,[95] the
termination of hepatic abscess is as follows: Of 300 cases, 169, or
56.3 per cent., remained intact--that is, had not advanced beyond the
liver; 48 were evacuated by operation, or 16 per cent.; 14, or 4.6 per
cent., entered the thoracic cavity; 28, or 9.3 per cent., opened into
the right lung; 15, or 5 per cent., entered the abdominal cavity; 7, or
2.3 per cent., opened into the colon; 1 entered the stomach; 3 entered
the hepatic vein near the vena cava; 1 communicated with the hepatic
ducts, 2 with the right kidney, etc.The termination of 162 fatal
cases, according to Rouis,[96] was as follows: 125 proved fatal in
consequence of the extent of the abscess or of the severity of the
accompanying dysentery; 3 terminated by gangrene of the walls of the
abscess; 3 by peritonitis; 12 by opening of the abscess; 2 by rupture
of adhesions; 11 by opening of the abscess into the pleura; 2 by
intercurrent and 3 by secondary pneumonia.Notwithstanding the
differences {1008} in the mode of expressing the conditions, the
general results are the same.[Footnote 95: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.of
Abscess in the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 96: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques, etc._, p.An abscess of the liver having discharged in a favorable way, healing
may take place.There may be such an extent of injury--the whole
secreting structure of the liver being destroyed--that repair is beyond
the power of the organism.The best results are attained when discharge
occurs by the most direct route externally; the next, by way of the
right lung; the third, by the stomach or intestine.Repair cannot be
hoped for when a large part of the normal hepatic structure is
destroyed.When the pus escapes the walls of the abscess approximate,
and union takes place by connective tissue, leaving a radiated or a
merely linear cicatrix to mark the site of the purulent collection.So
perfectly does repair take place in suitable subjects that no trace of
the lesion may remain.Those portions of the liver outside the borders of the abscess, and
beyond the vascular derangements produced by it, may be entirely
healthy.In the cases terminating in recovery the portion of the liver
unaffected by abscess continues to functionate normally.More or less
of the liver may be destroyed; hence it follows that recovery may be
partial.According to the damage done to the proper secreting structure
of the organ will the recovery be partial, limited, or complete.SYMPTOMS.--The existence of an abscess of the liver is determined by
systemic or general and by local symptoms, and they may be acute or
chronic.Systemic.--In acute cases the beginning of mischief may be announced by
a rigor, but more frequently this indicates the onset of suppuration,
and is one of the phenomena of the chronic form.As the disease occurs
in this country, a chill takes place suddenly in a case which presents
the usual symptoms of proctitis (dysentery) during the course of this
affection or soon after its apparent cure; then a febrile movement
occurs, and subsequently an irregular intermittent, the rise of
temperature being preceded by rigors or mere transient chilliness.With
these febrile symptoms there may be associated uneasiness in the right
hypochondrium, acute pain, or a feeling of weight and pressure, with
jaundice, etc.The fever is septicaemic, intermittent, or remittent if
it have any special type.In the septicaemic form the rigors are
severe, occur irregularly, sometimes daily, sometimes twice a day, and
at intervals of two or three days or longer; the fever rises to a high
point--104 degrees, 105 degrees, or higher--and the sweats are profuse.In the intermittent form the fever usually has the quotidian type; some
slight chilliness is experienced in the early morning as a rule, and
the exacerbation occurs in the afternoon and evening, the sweating
being slight toward the morning.More frequently, in the writer's
observation, the type of fever has been remittent, with periodical, but
not regularly so, exacerbations.In such cases the morning temperature
has been at 99 degrees or 100 degrees, and the evening 102 degrees or
103 degrees.Such a range of temperature may be present during three or
four weeks or even longer, the abscess gradually making its way
outwardly.Conclusions may be drawn from the behavior of the febrile
movement as to the character of the local affection, with the
limitations imposed by the necessary uncertainty of the data.If the
chills are decided rigors, the fever {1009} high, and the sweats
profuse, either pyaemic abscesses or large tropical abscesses
implicating neighboring organs exist.The simple intermittent,
especially the remittent, form of fever suggests abscesses of medium
size making their way outwardly, with only partial injury to the parts
traversed.In a certain portion of the cases the type of fever changes
when a large accumulation of pus takes place; after several weeks of a
mild remittent the fever becomes irregularly intermittent with rigors,
strong exacerbations, and profuse sweats.In protracted cases the fever
assumes the typhoid aspect; there is profound adynamia, dry tongue,
sordes, diarrhoea, and the usual symptoms of this state.When the
secreting structure of the liver is destroyed to a large extent, the
condition of acholia is superadded to the typhoid state.The pulse is irritable and quick from the beginning of the symptoms.In
a few instances a slow pulse, such as occurs in jaundice, has been
observed, but generally the number of cardiac contractions is in a
direct ratio with the body temperature.When typhoid symptoms supervene
in advanced cases the pulse becomes weak and dicrotic.The chronic cases with
mild remittent fever have little more than slight moisture of the
surface, whilst the acute and pyaemic cases are characterized by
profuse sweats.If to an irregular febrile movement, preceded by chills
and followed by sweats, there is added the tendency to sweat on all
occasions--on slight exertion, on sleeping, under any
excitement--suppuration may be suspected.General malaise, a sense of fatigue and exhaustion, and progressive
decline in flesh and strength occur.It is remarkable, however, how
some obese subjects preserve their roundness and apparent fulness of
habit.Usually, however, emaciation advances pari passu with the
progress of the suppuration.The more acute the symptoms, the more
rapid the wasting.When an encysted abscess develops in the course of a
chronic dysentery, there may be no appreciable change in the condition
of the patient properly attributable to the additional lesion.The loss
of appetite, the frequent vomiting, and often the dysenteric troubles,
contribute materially to the exhaustion and the wasting of the tissues.The stomachal derangements may be present with the initial symptoms,
but they are usually more pronounced when the abscess attains to
considerable size.A peculiar tint of the skin, especially of the face, is observed in
those cases without jaundice.There is an earthy or sallow hue, which
to the practised eye signifies suppuration.Jaundice is present in a
less proportion of cases.In 13 of Waring's cases the skin is said to
be sallow.In Rouis's collection icterus was present in 17 per cent.,
or 26 times in 155 patients.According to Waring, jaundice is rarely
present.In the 12 cases in my own hands actual jaundice was not
present in one, but 9 had an earthy hue or presented some yellowness of
the conjunctiva.In fact, jaundice does not have the importance as a
symptom which might, a priori, have been expected.The mental condition of these subjects is that of depression.They
sleep poorly, are disturbed by vivid dreams of a horrifying character,
and the nocturnal sweats increase the tendency to wakefulness.Hypochondria, or at least marked symptoms of mental depression, as
{1010} Hammond[97] has shown, are present in many cases.So frequent,
indeed, seems to be the association of a depressed mental state with
hepatic abscess that in every case of the former the liver should be
carefully explored.Hammond goes so far as to say that in every case of
hypochondriasis puncture of the liver with the aspirator needle should
be practised when any symptom, however indefinite, indicates the
existence of an abscess.Besides the condition of hypochondriasis in
many cases, there may be stupor, hebetude of mind, confusion due to
acholia, cholaemia (Flint's cholesteraemia), when a large part of the
liver structure is destroyed.[Footnote 97: _Neurological Contributions_, vol.68: "On
Obscure Abscesses of the Liver, their association with Hypochondria and
other Forms of Mental Derangement, and their Treatment."]Sweating has already been referred to as a phenomenon connected with
the febrile movement.It is necessary to state further that this may
vary in amount from a mere moisture of the surface connected with
sleep, or it may be a profuse diaphoresis with which the febrile
paroxysm terminates.As a systemic symptom, sweating is strongly
suggestive of suppuration, and may therefore be extremely significant,
in this connection, of suppuration in the liver.According to Waring,
of 75 cases specifically interrogated on this point, 72 presented this
symptom.123) to it as very constantly present, coming
on chiefly at night--sometimes generally over the body, sometimes
limited to the head, and always accompanied by an accelerated pulse.The urine in cases of hepatic abscess varies; it is never normal.There
may be merely an excess of urates--a symptom common enough in all
febrile affections and in suppuration.It is usually high-,
deficient in urea, and contains leucin and tyrosin, and not often
bile-pigment, except when jaundice is present, which, as we have seen,
is rather uncommon.It should be borne in mind that whilst the above-described mental and
cerebral and other symptoms are often present, they are by no means
invariably so.There are cases, usually of encysted abscess, in which
no functional disturbance of any kind exists.But the systemic symptoms
are by no means so important as the local.To these we must now direct
attention.Local.--The position, size, and shape of the liver are not without
significance, but it is strictly correct to say that an abscess of the
liver may exist without any change in the size of the organ or in its
relations to the surrounding organs.In 2 of 12 cases in the hands of
the writer there was no evidence of enlargement of the right
hypochondrium, but a difference in circumference of half an inch was
ascertained in favor of the left side.In 4 cases there was no
appreciable change in the size of the hepatic region; in one-half there
was an increase in the area of hepatic dulness.In one of the cases in
which the left side was the larger the abscess was of enormous extent,
and discharged by the stomach and intestine.The enlargement of the
liver may be very great.In one instance observed by the author the
abscess reached to the upper border of the third rib.Rarely does the
dulness extend more than two fingers' breadth below the inferior margin
of the ribs, although cases are reported in which the enlarged organ
reached to the crest of the ileum.As a rule, the diaphragm is pushed
up and the lung displaced, rather than the dulness is extended
downward.When the first tumefaction {1011} due to the initial
congestion takes place, the organ may be much larger than subsequently,
the pus becoming encysted and the normal state outside of the area of
suppuration being restored.The purulent collection in a large
proportion of the cases taking place in the right lobe, the extension
of dulness is in the same lines as the normal.When, however, the right
lobe is the seat of abscess, or a purulent collection forms around an
impacted calculus, the swelling may appear in the outer border of the
epigastrium next the ribs, and the increased area of dulness will be
across the epigastrium and occupying the superior portion of this
region.The general experience on these points corresponds to my own.Thus, according to Waring, there was an evident enlargement of the
liver in 90 cases, and no enlargement in 11.In most cases the increase
in size gives the impression of a fulness or hardness of the liver or
of a diffused swelling or tumor of the epigastrium.In some instances
the right hypochondrium is bulged out, the intercostal spaces widened,
and the side appears to be or is actually elevated, and occasionally
enlarged veins form, as in cases of the obstructed portal circulation
of cirrhosis.In a case recently presented at Jefferson College
Hospital clinic by the author, a globular swelling formed in the walls
of the abdomen just below the inferior margin of the ribs near the site
of the gall-bladder, and was held by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of this locality; but it had the history of an hepatic abscess, and
ultimately proved to be one.Rouis furnishes statistical evidence of
the time when the increase in size of the liver occurs with respect to
the other symptoms.He has noted an enlargement of the organ 73 times
in 122 cases.Of 51 cases, the liver was enlarged in 12 before
suppuration, in 22 at the onset of suppuration, and in 17 after
suppuration was established.In 49 examples the liver was enlarged in 2
before any other symptom was manifest, in 8 at the onset of symptoms,
and in 39 after the symptoms were well declared.Fluctuation is not referred to by the writers in general, and there are
no statistical data on this symptom, so far as our observation extends.No symptom could be more uncertain in all doubtful cases.When a large
accumulation has taken place and the parietes of the sac are thin,
fluctuation may be detected, but it cannot then be regarded as
decisive.When an abscess in the interior of the right lobe is
encysted, no fluctuation can be effected.The best mode of eliciting
fluctuation, according to Hammond, is to place the extremities of the
fingers of the left hand in the depression between the ribs over the
most prominent part of the right hypochondrium, and gently tap with the
fingers of the right hand the right border of the epigastrium.In 3 out
of 12 cases this method has apparently elicited fluctuation in my own
experience.The elasticity of the hepatic structure is such that the
method of palpation, however practised, must return a sensation nearly
allied to that of fluctuation in a purulent accumulation.It is
certain, therefore, that errors of observation are liable to occur, and
hence conclusions based on an apparent fluctuation should be accepted
with caution; under any circumstances it should be very distinct, and
even then should not be acted on unless supported by other suggestive
evidence.The uneasiness or pain felt in the right hypochondrium varies greatly
according to the position of the abscess, the degree and kind of
pressure exerted on neighboring organs, and the period of its
development.When {1012} the peritoneal layer of the liver is involved,
there will usually be acute pain, and this happens at two periods--when
the abscess first forms from an impacted calculus or from any cause
which includes the peritoneum, and subsequently when the pus, making
its way from the liver, excites inflammation in the peritoneal
investment of the liver, of the diaphragm, or affects ultimately the
pleural membrane.In the so-called pyaemic abscesses there is very
little pain, and in the case of the large single abscess in the
interior of the right lobe there is rather a sensation of weight or of
heaviness, of dragging than of acute pain.When the capsule of the
liver is put on the stretch or the peritoneal investment is inflamed,
then acute pain may be felt.More or less pain or local distress is, on
the whole, a usual symptom.According to Rouis,[98] local pain is
present in 141 out of 177 cases, or in 85 per cent.The statistics of
Waring[99] closely correspond, for of 173 patients affected with this
malady, in 153 there was more or less pain referable to the affected
organ.The position of the pain has some influence in determining the
seat of the malady, and often indicates the position of the abscess.As
respects the character of the pain, there is little uniformity; in
general it is a tensive, heavy, throbbing sensation, but under the
circumstances above mentioned this may have an acute or lancinating
character, as when the capsule or the peritoneal investment of the
organ becomes involved.[Footnote 98: _Recherches, etc._, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 99: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

Besides the pain directly referable to the liver there are painful
sensations felt in the neighboring parts, of very considerable
significance.These are often described as sympathetic pains, and are
referred to the shoulder--to the right shoulder when the right lobe is
the seat of mischief, and to the left shoulder when the abscess forms
in the left lobe of the liver.Although this statement has many
limitations, it is not without diagnostic importance.Rouis ascertained
the existence of the shoulder pain in 17 per cent.of the cases, or in
28 in a total of 163.Waring reports that this symptom was observed in
52 in a total of 76 cases.The right shoulder seems to be affected in
about the same ratio as the right lobe of the liver in 25 times out of
26 cases, according to Rouis.The shoulder pain appears at the same
time, in a majority of cases, as the hepatic pain, but it is very
capricious.It is most frequently at the top of the shoulder, but it
may be at the end of the clavicle, in the scapula, or extend down the
arm.Its duration is very irregular, appearing occasionally during the
existence of the disease, coming on at the outset, and lasting weeks or
months, or only felt on pressure over the liver, on coughing, or on
taking a full inspiration.The character of the pain is equally
uncertain.It is usually heavy, tensive, stinging, or may be merely a
sensation of soreness or of uneasiness or of weariness.The behavior of
the shoulder pain is partly explicable by reference to the path by
which the reflex is conveyed.As Luschka[100] has shown, the filaments
of the phrenic nerve supplied to the suspensory ligament and capsule of
the liver, put on the stretch or irritated, convey the impression to
the cord, and it is reflected over the sensory fibres of the fourth
cervical distributed to the shoulder.Rouis reports an instance in
which the deltoid was wasted.[Footnote 100: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

The decubitus of patients affected with hepatic abscess is often {1013}
extremely characteristic.To obviate the pressure on the swollen and
inflamed organ the position assumed is right lateral-dorsal, the body
inclined to the right, the right thigh flexed on the pelvis, and the
spinal column so curved as to relax the abdominal muscles of the right
side.When the pain and tenderness are not great there may be frequent
changes of position, but in repose the lateral-dorsal decubitus is
assumed.When the suppuration is well advanced and the accumulation
large, the patient keeps in that position nearly constantly.If
pressure interferes with the normal play of the lungs, and dyspnoea is
produced on assuming the recumbent posture, the attitude taken
expresses this state also: then the decubitus is lateral and partly
dorsal, but the body is raised to a half-upright.There are many
exceptions to these rules.Some lie easiest on the back, some on the
left side; but it is quite certain that much the largest number, when
uninfluenced by special circumstances, naturally place themselves as
above described.Jaundice is amongst the rarer symptoms.Rouis finds it to be present in
17 per cent.of the cases, Thierfelder in 16 per cent., and Waring in
somewhat less than 6 per cent.Referring to my own observation,
jaundice has rarely been present, but some yellowness of the
conjunctivae and a faint yellow tint of the skin generally have been
evident.The peculiar aspect of the countenance connected with
suppuration has rarely been wanting.When jaundice does occur, it is
referable to two conditions--to a catarrhal swelling of the bile-ducts,
which may be coincident with the onset of the suppurative inflammation;
to the pressure of the abscess on the hepatic or common duct, which
must happen at a late period.As an abscess of the liver forms and enlarges, pressure is exerted on
neighboring organs, producing very decided disturbances.Nausea and
vomiting, anorexia, a coated or glazed tongue, diarrhoea or dysentery,
are amongst the disorders of this kind involving the digestive
apparatus.There is nothing characteristic in the condition of the tongue which
does not belong to suppuration in any situation.Nevertheless, there
are some appearances that have a certain value in conjunction with
other diagnostic signs.At the onset of the suppurative inflammation
the tongue is more or less heavily coated, but as the case proceeds it
becomes dry and glazed in parts, whilst covered with a well-defined
membrane-like crust at the base and margins.This appearance is very
characteristic of the cases of suppuration, the abscess enlarging.In a
very important case observed by me lately there was a well-marked
diphtheritic-like exudation of the tongue and fauces toward the
termination of the case, the membrane forming as the pus accumulated.This appearance was coincident with a typhoid state.Nausea and vomiting appear with the beginning of symptoms, are
associated with the general signs of systemic disturbance, and are
especially prominent when an accumulation of pus takes place, being due
under these circumstances to pressure on the hepatic and solar plexuses
or to direct encroachment on the stomach--probably to both causes.The
frequency and persistence of the vomiting are points of much diagnostic
importance, according to Maclean[101] and Fayrer,[102] which I {1014}
am able to fully confirm from my own experience.The matters ejected by
vomiting consist of the contents of the stomach--glairy mucus, the
accumulation in the gall-bladder, altered blood (coffee-grounds)--and
the contents of the abscess if it discharge by the stomach.The
vomiting is most apt to occur during the febrile exacerbation or at the
time of sweating.The statistics are conclusive as to the frequency of
vomiting as a symptom.Of 84 cases in which special reference was made
to this point, in 74 nausea or vomiting existed.In my own experience
this symptom has never been wanting.[Footnote 101: "The Diagnostic Value of Uncontrollable Vomiting," by W.
C. Maclean, _Brit.Journ._, August 1, 1873.][Footnote 102: _Ibid._, September 26, 1873.]The relation between abscess of the liver and dysentery has been much
discussed.Under the head of Causes the influence of dysentery as a
pathogenetic factor has already been examined.We have now to study its
symptomatic relations.A considerable proportion of the cases occurring
in this country have been preceded by proctitis--simple, sporadic
dysentery affecting the rectum.In India a close relationship has been
traced between ulcerations of the intestinal canal and abscess.of the cases have occurred in those
who were actually suffering from dysentery or recent or old
ulcerations.As observed by Rouis in Algiers, out of 143 cases there
were 128 with dysentery, or 90 per cent.Budd[103] long ago maintained
that a peculiar poison generated at an open ulceration in the intestine
was the true cause.Moxon,[104] Dickinson, and others have lately
reaffirmed this explanation.A case by the latter[105] casts a strong
light on this question: A patient had extensive dysenteric ulceration
of the intestine and an abscess of the liver, without any symptoms
indicating their existence.Such a case teaches the instructive lesson
that dysenteric ulcerations may escape detection, and hence the
connection between abscess and the intestinal lesion remains unknown.In a small proportion of cases--about 5 per cent.--dysentery is a
result, apparently, of hepatic abscess.Whether the relation is
admitted to exist or not, it is a curious fact that in so many cases
ulcerative disease of the intestinal canal accompanies the hepatic
affection.Hemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum, gastro-intestinal
catarrh, etc.are produced by the pressure of an enlarging abscess on
the portal vein.[Footnote 103: _Diseases of the Liver_, 3d ed., p.[Footnote 104: _Pathological Transactions_, 1862 and subsequently.Numerous cases are recorded in the various volumes up to 1880.][Footnote 105: _Ibid._, vol.The urine contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, is usually
loaded with urates, and the amount of urea may be deficient when much
of the hepatic tissue is destroyed.From the beginning of symptoms some cough is experienced: it is short
and dry, but after a time in many cases the cough is catching and
painful, and finally may be accompanied by profuse purulent
expectoration.The breathing is short and catching when by the upward
extension of the mischief the diaphragm is encroached on, and may
become very painful when the pleura is inflamed.Ulceration of an
abscess into the lungs is announced by the signs of a local
pleuro-pneumonia--by the catching inspiration, the friction sound, the
crepitant rale, the bronchophony and bronchial breathing, and bloody
sputa usually, etc.Some time before the abscess really reaches the
diaphragm, preparation is made in the lung for the discharge through a
bronchus.The author has seen {1015} many examples of this, and a very
striking illustration of the same fact is afforded in a case by
Dickinson,[106] in which an abscess holding about four ounces was
contained in the upper part of the right lobe; its walls were irregular
and not lined by a limiting membrane.It is further stated that the
"right pleura was coated with flocculent lymph, and the cavity
contained serous fluid," etc.Here, in advance of the abscess,
preparation was made for its discharge through the lung.The tendency
of an abscess of the abdomen to external discharge is manifested in two
directions: those of the upper part tend to discharge through the
lungs, those of the lower part through the natural openings below.Abscesses of the liver come within the former rule, but it is not of
invariable application, since some discharge by the stomach or
intestine, some externally; yet a large proportion make their way
through the lungs.Another symptom referable to the pulmonary organs in
cases of hepatic abscess is singultus, or hiccough.This is a symptom
of the period of discharge rather, and is often extremely protracted
and exhausting.Pericarditis occurs in those cases in which discharge
takes place in this direction, and it may develop, as does pleuritis,
in advance of any change in the diaphragm.This preparation of the
thoracic organs for external discharge seems almost like a conscious
purpose, as if an intelligent supervision of these processes were
exercised.[Footnote 106: _Transactions of the Pathological Society_, vol.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As the facts already given have
sufficiently shown, the course of abscess of the liver is extremely
uncertain.From the beginning to the end there may not be a single
indication of its presence.On the other hand, a well-marked case is
perfectly characteristic.Abscesses of the liver are acute and
chronic--the former of short duration, accompanying pyaemia, portal
phlebitis, and similar conditions; the latter, arising in the course of
chronic dysentery or from unknown causes, especially if encysted,
remaining latent for weeks or months.The course of an abscess is much
influenced by the direction taken by the pus in the attempt at
discharge.This portion of the subject requires careful statement and
thorough treatment, and we therefore present it somewhat in detail.Beginning with his individual observations, the abscess in the author's
12 cases discharged--3 externally, 5 by the lungs, and 4 by the stomach
or intestines.In Waring's[107] collection of 300 fatal cases, 169
remained intact at death, 48 were operated on; consequently, only 83
are left for the purpose of this comparison.Of 83 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging spontaneously in some direction, 42 escaped into
the thoracic cavity or by the right lung (in 28); into the abdominal
cavity (15) or stomach (1) or intestine (7), 23; externally 2, besides
in special directions to be hereafter referred to.Rouis[108] has
tabulated the results in 30 cases of abscess fatal without an operative
influence.Of these, 2 discharged externally, 17 by the thorax (15 by
the lung), 5 by the stomach, 4 by the intestine, and 2 by the biliary
canals.[Footnote 107: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.[Footnote 108: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie,
etc._, _loc.The appearances presented when the discharge takes place through the
external parts are by no means uniform.When the epigastric or
umbilical region is the point of discharge, a globular tumor forms,
which may {1016} be mistaken for a fibroid or fatty growth; softening
in the centre of the mass occurs, and ultimately the pus is discharged.If the pus makes its way outwardly through the right hypochondrium, the
tumor formed is furrowed by the attachment to the ribs, and several
openings usually occur.The pus may burrow under the skin for some
distance and point in the axilla, or, making its way along the
suspensory ligament, emerge at the navel, or, descending, appear in the
lumbar region or under Poupart's ligament.As the statistics prove, the most usual route for discharge to take
place is by the thoracic cavity, especially the right lung.Some time
in advance of an opening in the diaphragm a localized pleuro-pneumonia
occurs, adhesions form between the pulmonary and costal pleura, and a
channel is tunnelled out for the passage of the pus to a bronchus.The
discharge of pus suddenly occurs after some days of cough and bloody
expectoration.Even in favorable cases the amount is so large that the
patient has extreme difficulty in disposing of it, and in unfavorable
cases, the quantity being large, the patient's life is ended by apnoea.In still other cases an extensive purulent accumulation may form in the
pleural cavity, the lung is compressed, and all the phenomena of an
empyema superadded to those of a hepatic abscess.In a case reported by
Westphalen[109] all the bile secreted by the patient came out by an
opening in the fifth intercostal space.The empyema thus induced may
indeed be the principal lesion, as in the case of the late Gen.Breckenridge, on whom thoracentesis was performed by Sayre of New York,
and in a case reported by Lower.[110] So far from this being uncommon,
as asserted by Thierfelder, when an abscess of the liver approaches the
diaphragm inflammatory symptoms begin on the pleural side, and thus
pyothorax may occur in advance of the perforation of this septum.[Footnote 109: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.Med._, 1873, Band xi.[Footnote 110: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1864, p.The opening of an hepatic abscess into the pericardium is rare, since
in Waring's collection of 300 fatal cases there was not one.When it
does occur, pain is experienced about the heart; the action of the
organ becomes irregular; praecordial anxiety and oppression are felt;
suffocative attacks occur; and very soon the symptoms of pericarditis
arise.Perforation of the ascending vena cava or of the hepatic vein
happens in about 2 per cent.When a quantity of pus is
thus turned into the circulation, disastrous results follow, not so
much from the infective nature of the pus as from the sudden increased
pressure within the vascular system and the labor imposed on the heart,
already failing.The escape of the pus into the peritoneal cavity occurs in about 11 per
cent.of the cases of spontaneous evacuation, according to Waring.Of
the 162 fatal cases collected by Rouis, 14 opened into the
peritoneum--about the same proportion as Waring gives.When discharge
takes place into the peritoneum, the patient passes into a condition of
collapse, or peritonitis is excited and rapidly proves fatal.In rare
instances the inflammatory reaction is restricted to a small area,
ulceration takes place through the abdominal parietes, and thus
discharge is effected.An opening may be made into the intestine or into the pelvis of the
kidney.In the former case pus is discharged by stool or by vomit, and
often in enormous quantity; in the latter by the urine, frequent and
{1017} painful micturition, with much pus, being the evidence of the
accident.In either case communication may be kept up with the abscess,
and the patient be worn out with the exhausting discharge maintained by
the intercommunication between the abscess and the canal through which
discharge takes place.Cases of hepatic abscess prove fatal without perforation.In Waring's
collection of 300 cases, 169 remained intact, in the words of the
author--that is, did not extend beyond the boundaries of the liver.Of
203 cases collected by Rouis, 96 did not extend beyond the liver.According to Thierfelder, about one-half of the cases of hepatic
abscess perforate the liver.These statistics therefore closely
correspond, and the general conclusion is very nearly expressed in the
formulated statement of Thierfelder.The duration of hepatic abscess cannot readily be expressed in figures.The acute cases terminate early by reason of the various complicating
conditions.The chronic cases are much influenced in their duration by
the presence of a limiting membrane, for if this be formed the duration
will be protracted over weeks or months; and those cases not thus
confined are necessarily of shorter duration.A period of latency may
result when the extension of the morbid process is thus hindered.Forming a conclusion from the general conduct of the cases, it may be
said that the duration of hepatic abscess is from two weeks to six
months.Of 220 cases collected by Waring, the average duration was 39
days.Rouis fixes the average duration in 179 cases at 60 days.Of
Waring's cases, the largest number (59) terminated in from 10 to 20
days; whilst Rouis places the maximum number (104) at from 11 to 60
days, the shortest duration of any case being 10 days, and the longest
480 days.The termination may be accelerated by the manner of discharge, as when
the abscess opens into the ascending vena cava, into the sac of the
pericardium, or into the peritoneal cavity.In my own cases, carefully
selected for these observations, death occurred in one during discharge
by the right lung, one within twelve hours after discharge by the
intestine, and one within ten days after discharge by the stomach and
intestine, the mortality of the whole being 75 per cent.In Waring's
collection of 300 fatal cases, 169 died whilst the abscess was still
intact--that is, in the liver.The mortality from abscess of the liver is very large.In Rouis's
collection of 203 cases, 162 died, 39 recovered entirely, and 2
improved; 80 per cent., therefore, proved fatal.According to De
Castro,[111] whose observations were made at Alexandria, Egypt, 93 in
208 cases died, this being 72.5 per cent.According to Ramirez,[112] of
11 cases of which an account is given in his memoir, 10 died and 1
recovered--a mortality of 90 per cent.40) also gives the
results arrived at by the Medico-chirurgical Society of Alexandria, who
collected 72 cases of abscess, of which 58 died, making the percentage
of deaths 80.5.Various circumstances besides the abscess affect the
result.An early successful operation, the mode of discharge, the
amount of hepatic tissue destroyed by the {1018} suppuration, the
extent of pre-existing lesions--especially ulcerations of the
intestinal canal--are important factors in the result.In respect to
some of these we have valuable statistical data.The discharge through
the lungs is the most favorable route, next by the parietes of the
abdomen, and lastly by the intestinal canal.One-half of those cases in
which discharge is effected by the right lung get well.This is my own
experience, and it accords with the observations of Rouis, of De
Castro, and others.Rouis gives the result in 30 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging by the right lung; of these 15 recovered.Of 25
cases observed by De Castro, discharging by the lungs, 19 recovered.Next to the discharge by the bronchi, the most favorable mode of exit
is externally, through the parietes of the abdomen; much less favorable
is by the stomach or intestine; but still more fatal is the discharge
into the cavity of the peritoneum.When the abscesses are multiple and
due to pyaemia, the termination is always in death.The numerous
lesions besides the hepatic accelerate the fatal issue.In the case of
large single abscesses the result is in a great measure due to
exhaustion from protracted suppuration.When in addition to the
formation of a great quantity of pus there is frequent vomiting and
rejection of aliment, the failure of strength is proportionally rapid.In favorable cases, after an abscess is evacuated through the right
lung, recovery takes place promptly.When the discharge occurs through
the abdominal wall, the process is much slower, and often fistulous
passages with several orifices, very slow to heal, are formed.Complete
recovery may ultimately take place.The recovery will be incomplete in
those cases with large loss of hepatic substance, especially when this
coincides, as it usually does, with catarrh, ulceration, and other
lesions of the intestinal tube.Again, the recovery will be incomplete
in those cases where there are imperfect healing of the abscess site
and a fistulous communication with the exterior.[Footnote 111: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, _loc.[Footnote 112: _Du Traitement des Abces du Foie, Observations
receuilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, _loc.cit._]

It is possible for the arrest and healing of a suppurative inflammation
of the liver to take place without discharge.Under such circumstances
the watery part of the pus is absorbed, the solid constituents undergo
a fatty metamorphosis, are emulsionized, and thus absorbed, and
gradually closure of the damaged area is effected by a
connective-tissue formation.We must, however, accept with caution
those examples of this process which are supposed to have occurred
because radiating cicatrices are discovered on the surface of the
liver.In a case of hepatic abscess discharging through the lung, known
to the writer, after death, which occurred fifteen years subsequently,
there was no trace of the mischief, so perfectly had repair been
effected.Radiating cicatrices are so often of syphilitic origin that
they cannot be accepted as proof of the former existence of an abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--He who finds the diagnosis of abscess of the liver easy
under all circumstances can have had but little experience with the
numerous difficulties in the way of a correct opinion.There are cases
so plain that the most casual inspection suffices to form a conclusion;
there are cases so difficult that the most elaborate study fails to
unravel the mystery.The maladies with which hepatic abscess may be
confounded are echinococcus of the liver, dropsy of the gall-bladder,
cancer, abscess of the abdominal wall, empyema, or hydrothorax, etc.As
regards echinococcus, the difference consists in the slow and painless
enlargement characteristic of echinococcus, and the absence of any
symptoms other than those {1019} due to the mere pressure of the
enlarging mass.In abscess there may be no apparent enlargement, or the
increase in the area of dulness may be very great, or after a period of
increase of size there may be contraction due to the formation of pus,
and hence limitation of the inflammation; finally, the accumulation of
fluid may be sufficient to cause dulness up to the inferior margin of
the second rib.There are no corresponding changes of size in the
echinococcus cyst.Furthermore, abscess of the liver large enough to be
recognized by the increased dimensions of the organ will be accompanied
by more or less pain in the right hypochondrium and by a septicaemic
fever.On the other hand, an echinococcus tumor is not accompanied by
fever, pain, or tenderness, and it has that peculiar elastic trembling
known as the purring tremor.The most certain means of differential
diagnosis is the use of an aspiration-needle and the withdrawal of a
portion of the fluid.The presence of pus with hepatic cells will be
conclusive of abscess, whilst a serous fluid with echinococci hooklets
will prove the existence of the echinococcus cyst.In cases of dropsy of the gall-bladder there are no febrile symptoms,
no chills, and the tenderness when present is limited to the pyriform
body, the seat of the accumulation of fluid, and no general enlargement
of the liver can be made out.At the point of swelling fluctuation may
be detected, or if the gall-bladder is filled with calculi the
sensation imparted to the touch is that of a hard, nodular body of an
area and position corresponding to that of the gall-bladder.Tapping
the gall-bladder, an easy and safe procedure, will resolve all doubts.When an impaction of a gall-stone is the cause of abscess, the clinical
history is eminently characteristic: there are attacks of hepatic
colic, after one of which the chills, fever, and sweats belonging to
hepatic abscess occur.The differentiation of cancer of the liver from abscess rests on the
following considerations: In cancer there is slow enlargement, with
pain; a more or less nodular state of the organ without fluctuation;
usually ascites; no rigors; no fever and sweats.In abscess the liver
may or may not be enlarged; there are rigors, fever, and sweating, and
the surface of the organ, so far as it can be reached, is smooth and
elastic, and it may be fluctuating.Cancer happens in persons after
middle life, develops very slowly, and is accompanied by a peculiar
cachexia; abscess occurs at any period, very often succeeds to or is
accompanied by dysentery and by the usual phenomena of suppuration.It is extremely difficult to separate an abscess in the abdominal wall,
in the right hypochondrium, or a tumor in this region, from an abscess
of the liver.The history of the case, the existence of a dysentery or
of an apparent intermittent or remittent fever before the appearance of
a purulent collection, will indicate the liver as the probable source
of the trouble.Attention has already been called to a case in which an
abscess of the liver was supposed by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of the abdominal wall.The history in this case of an obstinate
remittent fever, followed by the appearance of a tumor of the
hypochondrium and by a preliminary discharge at the umbilicus, clearly
indicated the nature of the trouble.In the absence of any history of
the case it is extremely difficult to fix the origin of a suppurating
tumor originating, apparently, in the depth of the right hypochondrium.Mistakes are frequently made in the case of an abscess developing in
{1020} the convexity of the right lobe of the liver and pushing the
diaphragm up to the third, even to the second, rib, and thus producing
conditions identical with empyema of the right thorax.Such instances
of hepatic abscess are peculiarly difficult of recognition, because,
the physical signs being the same as those of empyema, the
differentiation must rest on the clinical history.In cases of empyema
proper the effusion in the chest is preceded by pain and accompanied by
an increasing difficulty of breathing; in hepatic abscess there are, as
a rule, symptoms of disturbance in the hepatic functions, fluctuation
in the hepatic region, dysentery, etc., long anterior to any
disturbance in the thoracic organs.Again, empyema may be a latent
affection, without any symptom except some obscure pain and a
progressive increase in the difficulty of breathing; on the other hand,
abscess of the liver is preceded by symptoms of liver disease and of
associated maladies.A dry, purposeless cough is present in many cases
of abscess; a painful cough with bloody expectoration occurs when
preparation is making for discharge through the lungs.Errors of diagnosis are liable to occur in the consideration of
symptoms unquestionably hepatic in origin.Thus, the intermittent fever
accompanying some cases of hepatic colic, like the shivering fits and
fever which occur in cases of nephro-lithiasis, may be confounded with
the septicaemic fever of hepatic abscess.An attentive examination of
the attendant circumstances, especially a careful survey of the right
hypochondrium, can alone determine the nature of the symptoms.In all
doubtful cases the experimentum crucis of puncture with the
exploring-needle becomes a measure of necessity.When all diagnostic
indications are at fault, the needle of the aspirator may decide the
issue.An abundant experience has shown that a needle of suitable size
may be introduced into the right lobe without any ill result--often,
indeed, with distinctly good effects when there is no suppuration or
when pus cannot be detected.In the present state of our knowledge it
cannot be determined why puncture of the organ should be beneficial in
cases having the symptomatic type of hepatic abscess when none exists;
but of this fact there is no doubt.TREATMENT.--As the formation of pus is coincident with or causative of
the first symptoms, it is obvious that treatment directed to prevent an
abscess can rarely succeed.Yet it is probable that now and then an
abscess just forming has been arrested and healing effected.At the
onset of symptoms some large doses of quinine, with a little morphine
(scruple j of the former and 1/8 gr.of the latter), every four or six
hours, may have a decided curative effect.During the course of the
septicaemic fever, with its chills and febrile exacerbations, quinine
in full doses and alcohol according to the conditions present are
necessary remedies.As the symptoms develop saline laxatives are useful
until the formation of pus becomes evident, when all perturbating
treatment of the intestinal canal should cease.If dysentery be present
when the hepatic symptoms arise, it should be cured as promptly as
possible; and of all remedies for this purpose, ipecac given in the
usual antidysenteric quantity offers the best prospect of relief.For
the dysentery which succeeds to abscess, and is probably, in part at
least, dependent on portal obstruction, the mineral astringents, as
copper sulphate, are the most effective remedies.As far as
practicable, after an abscess has formed the intestinal canal should be
kept quiet, for any considerable disturbance will {1021} endanger the
escape of pus into the peritoneal cavity.Persistent vomiting is very
significant of pressure by an enlarging abscess in the stomach, and
usually signifies an abscess associated with impacted calculus.It is
important in such cases to maintain, as far as can be done, a quiescent
condition of the stomach, for the purpose of preventing rupture into
the peritoneal cavity and to favor the nutrition which is seriously
endangered by the repeated vomiting.Effervescent soda powders are very
useful; carbolic acid in solution, or creasote-water with or without
bismuth, is beneficial; champagne, very dry and highly effervescent,
has been, in the writer's hands, remarkably efficient.As food becomes
a most important need in such cases, milk and lime-water, wine-whey,
egg-nog, and similar aliments must be given in small doses and
frequently.Nutrient enemata, prepared from eggs, milk, and beef-juice,
with the materials for digestion--acid and pepsin--may be made to
supplement the stomach, but such efforts have a very limited utility,
owing to the state of the hepatic functions and to the obstruction of
the portal circuit.In all cases it is necessary to maintain the
strength by suitable aliment and the judicious use of stimulants.The
long-continued and profuse suppuration makes an enormous demand on the
vital resources of the patient, and this must be compensated by
suitable food-supplies.As the formation of pus has taken place in most cases when symptoms
have begun, the question of highest importance is, Shall the pus be
evacuated?The statistical evidence relating to this question becomes
then an extremely valuable guide.As in almost all cases of puncture of
the liver for the evacuation of an abscess some part of the liver
substance must be passed through, it is necessary to note how far this
can be done without inflicting permanent injury on the organ.Hammond
has punctured the liver in eight cases without the presence of an
abscess, and of these not one has presented any unfavorable symptom.The author has punctured the liver, penetrating well into the interior,
in two cases in which no abscess was discovered, but the symptoms of
hepatitis existed, with the effect to improve the symptoms.In
Condon's[113] collection of 11 cases there were 8 of abscess evacuated
by the trocar, and 3 of acute hepatitis in which abscess had not
formed, but in which the puncture procured the most decided
amelioration of the symptoms.We have heretofore referred to Hammond's
experience in the puncture of the liver in cases of hypochondriasis,
this condition appearing to depend in some instances on the presence of
abscess.In a number of instances abscesses did exist, but in many
others there was no apparent lesion of the liver, but in these cases
the puncture of the organ was without any ill result.Testimony to the
same effect is given by Ramirez,[114] who asserts that he had not known
a single instance in which any ill result followed puncture of the
liver.It may therefore be regarded as certain that exploratory
puncture of the organ for the purpose of diagnosis as well as for
treatment can at any time be performed with suitable precautions in
respect to the size, condition, and character of the instrument.[Footnote 113: "On the Use of the Aspirator in Hepatic Abscess," Dr.E.
H. Condon, _The Lancet_ (London), August, 1877.][Footnote 114: _Du Traitement des Abces du Foie, Observations
recueilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, p.The authorities of most experience are agreed that, provided with the
{1022} aspirator, the abscess may be punctured as soon as a purulent
collection can be ascertained to exist.The obvious reason for tapping
the abscess is its tendency to extend in various directions, destroying
the hepatic substance.In those examples confined by a limiting
membrane, after a time of inactivity ulceration begins, and the pus
seeks an outlet in some direction.The early evacuation by a suitable
aspirator becomes then a measure of the highest necessity.The good
effects of puncture with even such a crude instrument as the trocar is
well exhibited in the statistics collected by Waring.[115] In a
collection of 81 cases opened by the knife or trocar there were 66
deaths, making the percentage of recoveries 18.5.In these cases the
operative procedure was a final measure, and the mischief had been done
almost if not quite in its entirety.The statistics of Waring are
concerned with a period anterior to 1850.Although they demonstrate the
value of the trocar and evacuation of the abscess, as compared with the
results of the natural course of the disease, the far greater success
of the treatment by the aspirator is shown by the statistics of recent
times.Thus in McConnell's[116] 14 cases, also of India, in which the
aspirator was used to empty the sac, 8 recovered and 6 died.The
statistics of Waring may also be profitably compared with those of
Condon,[117] in which, of 8 cases of abscess evacuated by the
aspirator, 4 recovered, or 50 per cent.They may also be compared with
Sach's[118] cases, 21 in number, of which 8 recovered, or 38 per cent.,
and with the cases of De Castro[119] of Alexandria, who reports 22
large abscesses operated on, the proportion of cures being 31.8 per
100, and 10 small abscesses, the proportion of cures being 70 per 100.In a case seen in consultation with Collins, in this city, last year,
the aspirator was used by us about three months after the symptoms of
abscess declared themselves.About a quart of bloody pus was drawn off
at once, the opening sealed, and no subsequent accumulation occurred,
the patient entirely recovering, for after a year he was seen
(December, 1884) in complete health.From these data we draw the
important conclusion that early operation is desirable.This fact may
be formulated in the expression: In all cases of hepatic abscess use
the aspirator whenever the presence of pus is made out.When the
abscess is large, and especially when communication is established with
the parietes of the abdomen, a free opening, followed by the insertion
of a drainage-tube, is the proper method to pursue.If the pus
reaccumulates, it is good practice to inject the cavity with tincture
or compound solution of iodine after the pus is drawn off, provided the
dimensions of the abscess are not too great.[Footnote 115: _An Inquiry into the Statistics of Abscess of the
Liver_, _loc.cit._]

of the Liver treated by this Method," _Indian Annals of Medical
Science_, July, 1872, quoted.][Footnote 117: _Lancet_, _supra_.][Footnote 118: _Ueber die Hepatitis der heissen Lander, etc._, von Dr.[Footnote 119: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, par le Docteur S. V. de Castro (d'Alexandrie
d'Egypte), Paris, 1870, p.As regards the mode of proceeding, the following are useful rules:
Ascertain, if possible, the existence of fluctuation; locate the point
where the walls of the abscess are thinnest; insert an
exploring-needle, and if the depot of pus is reached substitute a
trocar having a sufficient calibre to evacuate the contents of the
abscess; observe antiseptic precautions in respect to each detail of
the operative procedure, and after the removal of the canula or needle,
if a drainage-tube is not necessary, close the {1023} wound
antiseptically.If drainage is necessary, keep the cavity empty and use
proper solutions to prevent septic decomposition.When an abscess of
the liver is pointing, the best place to puncture is where the abscess
is most prominent and it walls thinnest, but if the accumulation of pus
is encysted and there is no attempt at effecting an exit, the
exploring-needle should be passed into the interior of the right lobe,
the most usual site of suppuration.If pus be reached, a larger trocar
may be inserted to evacuate the cavity thoroughly.Repeated insertion
of the needle-trocar is preferable when the abscess is small, but when
the accumulation is large and sufficiently firm attachments to the
abdominal parietes exist, a drainage-tube will be necessary.In what direction soever discharge of an abscess may take place, the
general indications are to support the powers of life by food and
stimulants.It is useful, by
the application of a firm flannel bandage, to keep the liver in its
proper position and maintain it there.When pointing of an abscess
occurs, a large flaxseed poultice is a soothing and a mechanically
supporting application.DEFINITION.--By the term acute yellow atrophy is meant an acute
affection of the liver, characterized by rapid wasting or degeneration
of the organ, accompanied by the systemic symptoms belonging to an
acute acholia or cholaemia.It is an acute, diffused inflammation, with
atrophy of the proper gland-elements.It has been called icterus
gravis, malignant icterus, hemorrhagic icterus, malignant jaundice,
etc.HISTORY.--Cases having a more or less exact resemblance to acute yellow
atrophy have been occasionally reported from the earliest period.Amongst English physicians, Bright[120] was one of the first to give an
accurate account of the clinical history of some well-defined cases.Rokitansky[121] was really the first to define the disease from the
pathological standpoint, and it was he who designated it acute yellow
atrophy, this term being intended to signify the nature of the
objective changes.The first treatise ever published on the disease as
a distinct morbid entity was the monograph of Horaezek,[122] which
appeared in 1843.Amongst the French, Ozonam in 1847 was the first to
recognize and describe the disease as a distinct affection, although
Andral[123] had several years before mentioned an affection of the
liver which corresponded in some of its features to this affection.In
1862, Wagner[124] asserted that many of the cases of acute yellow
atrophy were only examples of acute phosphorus-poisoning, and that no
real distinction exists between the two affections.This statement has
been warmly disputed by various German observers, but there is no doubt
a close resemblance between the two affections.[Footnote 120: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1836, vol.[Footnote 121: _Handbook of Pathological Anatomy_, Am.[Footnote 122: Quoted by Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious
Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 123: _Clinique medicale_, 1839, tome ii.[Footnote 124: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1862, p.CAUSES.--There can be no doubt that acute yellow atrophy is a very rare
disease, since so few examples are found post-mortem.In the course of
a very large experience in autopsical examinations I have met with but
{1024} one characteristic example.[125] According to Legg, it is "one
of the rarest diseases known to man."[Footnote 125: _General Field Hospital_, December, 1863.]Several theories have been proposed to explain the occurrence of this
affection, but without success.It has been ascribed to an excess in
the production of bile, to stasis in the bile, and to a sudden
saturation of the hepatic cells with biliary matters contained in the
portal vein.That these supposed causes are really influential in
producing the malady can hardly be entertained.That there is a
peculiar poison which has a causative relation to the disease is
rendered probable by the fact that a condition closely allied to this
disease is produced by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other
poisons.Is it not a ptomaine generated under unknown conditions in the
intestine?Especially does the morbid anatomy of phosphorus-poisoning
nearly agree in all its details with icterus gravis--so nearly that by
many German authorities they are held to be identical.Age has a certain influence in the causation of this disease.It is
rarely seen in early life, Lebert in a collection of 63 cases having
found only 2 before ten years of age, yet there has been a well-marked
case at three, and Hilton Fagge reports one at two and a half years of
age.Nevertheless, much the largest number occur between fifteen and
twenty-five years of age, and the maximum age may be fixed at sixty.The influence of sex in the pathogeny is most remarkable.It is true in
Lebert's collection of 72 cases there were 44 men and 28 women, but it
is now known that he did not properly discriminate in his selection of
supposed examples of the disease.The statistics of all other observers
are opposed to those of Lebert.Thus, in Frerichs' collection of 31
cases, carefully sifted to eliminate error, there were 22 women and 9
men.Legg has also collected 100 cases of acute yellow atrophy, and of
these 69 were women or girls.The most active period of life--from
twenty to thirty years of age--is the usual period for the appearance
of this disease.More than one-half of Lebert's cases occurred between
fifteen and twenty-five; and of Frerichs', two-thirds happened between
twenty and thirty years of age.In Legg's collection of 100 cases, 76
were between fifteen and thirty-five years of age.What is the
condition of women at this period in life which renders them so
susceptible to this malady?There can be no doubt that pregnancy is the
great factor.Of 69 cases especially interrogated on this point,
examined into by Legg, in 25 pregnancy was ascertained to exist.In
Frerichs' collection one-half were women in the condition of pregnancy.The period of pregnancy at which the disease appears varies from the
fourth to the ninth month, the greatest number occurring at the sixth
month.So long ago as 1848, Virchow drew attention to the remarkable
changes in the liver due to pregnancy.Sinety[126] has studied the
effect of lactation on the liver, and has ascertained the existence of
fatty degeneration.There is a form of jaundice which accompanies
menstruation, as shown by Senator,[127] Hirschberg, and others.These
facts indicate a certain relationship between the sexual system of the
female and the liver, but they do not indicate the nature of the
connection, if any exist, between this condition and acute yellow
atrophy.[Footnote 126: _De l'Etat du Foie chez les Femelles en Lactation_,
Paris, 1873 (pamphlet).][Footnote 127: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1872, p.615, "Ueber
Menstruelle Gelbsucht."]The influence of depressing emotions has been supposed to be effective
{1025} in producing this disease, but it is more than doubtful if such
a relationship exists.Lebert, however, refers 13 of his cases to this
cause, but Legg, who bases his statements on the study of 100
carefully-recorded cases, is sceptical regarding the effect of such
influences.Syphilis has in some instances appeared to be the
principal, if not the only, pathogenetic factor, and Legg[128] compares
the action of the virus of syphilis to the effect of phosphorus,
mercury, etc.[Footnote 128: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The anatomical changes occurring in this disease
indicate the existence of a systemic condition: the lesions are not
limited to the liver, but involve various other organs.The changes in
the liver should be first described, since the name of the disease is
derived from the alterations in this organ.As the name indicates, the
lesions are atrophic, but not all examples show this.In some cases
there is little change in the size of the organ; in others the wasting
is extreme; certainly in all typical examples the liver is reduced in
size.The variations in size observed are probably due to the stage at
which the inspection is made: if early, the organ may not be reduced in
size, may be even somewhat enlarged by the deposition of new material;
if later, the atrophic changes will be more or less pronounced.When
the atrophy has taken place, the size of the liver is reduced to
one-half, even to one-third, of its original dimensions; it is then
soft, almost like pulp, and cannot maintain its shape, but flattens out
on the table.The capsule is much wrinkled and the color of the organ
is yellowish, variegated by islets of reddish or brownish-red color,
these spots being somewhat depressed below the general surface and
having a firm texture.On section the boundaries of the lobules are
either lost or have become very indistinct, the line of section being
bloodless.The knife with which the sections are made becomes greasy.In some instances ecchymoses are discovered under the capsule, and
rarely hemorrhagic extravasations in the substance of the liver.The
bile-ducts are found intact, as a rule.The greatest change in the size
of the liver is observed in the left lobe.The duration of the disease,
as has been indicated above, has a marked influence over the size and
condition of the liver.The atrophic shrinking of the liver occurs more
decidedly after the ninth day.In general, the tissue of the liver is
soft and pulpy in consistence.On microscopic examination the most
important alterations are seen to have occurred in the hepatic cells;
ultimately, these cells disappear, being replaced by fatty and
connective-tissue detritus; but before this stage is reached important
alterations have taken place in the form and structure of these bodies:
the cells become granular and fatty, and lose their sharpness and
regularity of contour, especially at the periphery of the lobule, but
ultimately all the cells within the lobule undergo atrophic
degeneration.In this atrophic degeneration of the hepatic cells, in
their fatty degeneration, and ultimately entire disappearance, consist
the real proofs of the disease.The red islets of tissue already
alluded to consist of the fatty detritus mixed with crystals of
haematoidin.More or less increase of the connective tissue is noted in many of the
cases--increase of connective tissue with numerous young cells formed
around the vessels and the bile-ducts (Waldeyer[129]).The changes in
the {1026} liver would surely be incomplete without some references to
the minute organisms which play so important a part in modern
pathology.Waldeyer was the first to demonstrate the presence of
bacteria in the pigment-remains of the hepatic cells.Other observers
have been unable to detect them, so that at present the parasitic
origin of this affection remains sub judice.Important changes also take place in the spleen, but the opinions on
this point are somewhat contradictory.Frerichs found the spleen
enlarged in most of his cases; Liebermeister, on the other hand, and
Legg,[130] find that the spleen is enlarged in about one-third of the
cases.When the atrophic changes occur in the liver, more or less
swelling of the splenic veins must occur in consequence of portal
obstruction.The peritoneum, especially the omental part, is the seat
of multiple ecchymoses, and the endothelium is fatty.The mesenteric
glands are usually swollen.More or less blackish or brownish fluid,
consisting of altered blood, is usually found in the stomach, and the
same, assuming a tar-like consistence, in the large intestine.Ecchymoses of rather small size are distributed over the stomach and
intestines.The epithelium of the stomach-glands is found granular and
disintegrating, and a catarrhal state of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane exists throughout.The secretions are never normal, and the
stools are wanting in bile or present a tarry appearance, due to the
presence of blood.[Footnote 130: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _supra_.]They consist essentially
in a granular and fatty degeneration of the tubular epithelium, whence
the altered appearance of the cortex.Multitudes of bacteria crowd the
pyramids.Ecchymoses also are found in the mucous membrane of the
pelvis of the kidney, in the bladder, and indeed all along the
genito-urinary tract.The muscular tissue of the heart is in a state of acute fatty
degeneration, beginning with a granular change which may at the outset
be of very limited extent and involve but few fibres.The endo- and
pericardium are studded with ecchymoses or marked by hemorrhagic
extravasations, and the pleura presents similar appearances, but not to
the same extent.The brain does not always show evidences of change, but in many
instances there are ecchymoses of the meninges; the walls of the
vessels are affected by fatty degeneration.The tissues of the body are more or less deeply stained with bile.The
pathological change on which the jaundice depends has been variously
stated, but the most probable explanation is that which refers it to
mechanical obstruction of the bile-ducts, either by catarrhal swelling
or fatty degeneration of the epithelium.Notwithstanding the prominence
of the hepatic symptoms, acute atrophy of the liver is probably only
one element in a constitutional morbid complexus.SYMPTOMS.--Acute yellow atrophy begins in two modes--the grave symptoms
preceded by mild prodromes, or the most serious symptoms appear at the
onset.The usual prodromes are
referable to the gastro-intestinal canal, and consist of loss of
appetite, nausea, vomiting, a bitter taste in the mouth, headache, and
general malaise.Indeed, the opening attack may be much like an {1027}
ordinary bilious seizure or acute gastro-duodenal catarrh or a sick
headache.In some cases the initial symptoms--nausea and
diarrhoea--appear to be induced by an indigestible article of food.Jaundice never fails to be present at some period, but is usually one
of the prodromic symptoms.It has no special characteristics by which
the gravity of the approaching seizure may be measured.It is usually
rather deep, and all parts are deeply stained, but the coloration may
be limited to the body and upper extremities.No change in pulse or
temperature, except the usual depression of both functions, is to be
observed; the urine is deeply stained with pigment, and the feces are
grayish, colorless, or parti-.The period of time elapsing before the serious symptoms come on is not
constant; from one week to several months have been the variations
observed.In a minority of the cases no prodromes have occurred, but
the grave symptoms have declared themselves at once.From the
appearance of the jaundice up to the onset of severe symptoms the time
has varied from two weeks to several months, but has rarely exceeded
three months.During this time there may be nothing to indicate the
gravity of the approaching symptoms; in fact, the case then, as at the
onset, seems to be one of simple gastro-duodenal catarrh associated
with catarrhal jaundice.The onset of serious symptoms is most usually
announced by dilatation of the pupil.If, therefore, in a case of
apparently simple catarrhal jaundice, especially in a pregnant female,
there should occur without apparent reason a marked and persistent
dilatation of the pupil, the possibility of the case being one of acute
atrophy should be apprehended.This symptom is not, alone, of
sufficient value to decide the character of the case, but then an
obstinate insomnia comes on, violent headache is experienced, there is
more or less confusion of mind, and jactitations or an extreme
restlessness occurs.When such pronounced nervous symptoms appear the
character of the attack is explained.Various divisions have been proposed to mark the type of the symptoms:
thus, the icteric period embraces the prodromal symptoms with jaundice;
the toxaemic period is that stage characterized by profound nervous
disturbances.Ozonam has divided the symptoms into those of the
prodromal period and those of the serious stage, the latter being
subdivided into the symptoms of excitation and those of collapse.There
may be no prodromal period, however; without any preliminary symptoms
the patient is suddenly seized with delirium and passes into a
condition of coma and insensibility, or the first evidence of serious
illness may be convulsions.It is probable, however, that in even the
most sudden cases mild prodromal symptoms had occurred, but were
overlooked.There is much variability in the symptoms of the toxaemic
period.There are three symptoms: excitement with delirium, sometimes
delirium ferox; coma, less or more profound; and convulsions.Legg has
numerically expressed the relative frequency of these symptoms thus: Of
100 cases of unquestionable acute atrophy, 76 had become comatose, 59
were delirious, and 32 had suffered convulsions.[131] According to the
same authority, delirium and coma were associated together in about
one-half of the cases, but in pregnant women coma often occurs alone
(Legg).Usually, when convulsions happen there has been either coma or
delirium.With these cerebral symptoms there are often present various
{1028} disturbances of motility and sensibility, such as local
convulsions, jactitations, hiccough, extreme restlessness, paralysis of
the sphincters, and incontinence of urine and feces or retention,
grinding of the teeth, exalted sensibility of the skin, or it may be
complete anaesthesia, severe itching of the surface, etc.[Footnote 131: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

During the toxaemic period, and directly dependent on the retention of
excrementitious matters in the blood, hemorrhages occur from the mucous
surfaces, from wounds, and into the various serous membranes.A changed
state of the blood being present in all cases of this disease, the
proportion in which extravasations take place is high--in about 71.3
per cent.according to Liebermeister, and 80 per cent.The latter author regards these estimates as rather low.When
hemorrhage occurs in the stomach in small amount, it presents itself as
coffee-grounds or as black vomit, and in the intestine in the form of
black, tarry stools or melaena.Hemorrhage may also occur from the
surface of an ulcer, from a fresh wound, a leech-bite, etc.; but the
most usual form of extravasation of blood after the gastro-intestinal
is epistaxis or bleeding from the nose.Women who abort, as they are
very apt to do when this disease comes on, may suffer from frightful
hemorrhage, and deaths have been thus caused.Various opinions have
been expressed as to the cause of the hemorrhagic condition--by some
attributed to the changes in the composition of the blood; by others to
the alterations of the vessel walls; both factors are doubtless
concerned.During the prodromic period the temperature of the body, as in the case
of ordinary uncomplicated jaundice, is rather depressed below normal,
sometimes as much as two degrees; but when the toxaemic stage comes on
the body-heat rises to a variable extent, but usually over 100 degrees
F. In some cases no febrile movement can be detected; in others a very
considerable elevation of temperature occurs, but very rarely attains
to 105 degrees or 106 degrees F. The pulse becomes very rapid, in some
instances rising to 140; but without any apparent cause it may fall
suddenly to 70 or 80, and these fluctuations may take place several
times a day.The rise of temperature and a very rapid pulse may come on
in the final coma only; and immediately after death, as Legg points
out, the body-heat may attain the maximum elevation.As the toxaemic period develops the tongue becomes dry, glazed,
fissured, sordes form on the teeth and lips, the breath becomes fetid,
and the breathing may assume the Cheyne-Stokes type.The nausea and
vomiting of the prodromal period persist, and the ominous
coffee-grounds appear in the rejected matters, or grumous masses--clots
acted on by the gastric juice--are brought up.Black, pitch-like, or
tarry stools, the result of hemorrhage, are passed toward the
end--involuntarily when liquid.When no blood is present the stools are
grayish and without bile.Constipation may be the condition instead of
diarrhoea in about one-third of the cases.Various eruptions have been observed on the skin, such as petechiae,
roseola, eczema, etc., but their very variety, as their occasional
appearance, indicates their accidental relationship to the disease.The urine is much altered in character, but it is usually acid in
reaction, although it has been observed neutral or alkaline.The
specific gravity is at or nearly normal, and it has a deep-brownish or
bilious hue {1029} due to the presence of bile-pigment.The most
important change in the composition of the urine is the diminished
quantity of urea or its entire disappearance; the phosphates, and
especially the chlorides, are also usually diminished in amount; and
albumen and leucin and tyrosin appear to a lesser or greater extent,
together with hyaline, fatty, and granular casts.Although the observations are somewhat contradictory, it seems pretty
definitely established that the blood is more or less altered in
composition, morphological and chemical.The red corpuscles are
diminished in amount, and often deformed; the white corpuscles are
increased; and excrementitious products--urea, leucin, tyrosin, and
cholesterin--are found in greater or less quantity.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Although, as a rule, the course of
acute atrophy is rapid, it is not invariably so.In some instances the
prodromic symptoms have continued through several months, but,
according to Thierfelder, one-half of the cases terminate in from three
to five weeks, and in only 10 per cent.The course of the disease is extremely rapid in pregnant
females, rarely extending beyond the second week.An extended course of
the disease is due to delay in the prodromic stage, the toxaemic period
being always absolutely and relatively shorter.In the condition of
pregnancy the danger is increased by the hemorrhages, and the early
termination is due chiefly to this factor.When the duration of the
disease is protracted and its evolution normal, the accumulation of
hepatic excrementitious matters sets up cerebral disturbance, which
becomes a pronounced feature of the case.As in the
course of the disease the hepatic cells undergo solution and
disintegration, their restoration can hardly be regarded as possible,
certainly not probable.Any curative result must, then, be wrought in
the prodromic period, when the diagnosis must be viewed with some
mistrust.DIAGNOSIS.--George Harley[132] maintains the singular doctrine that
acute yellow atrophy is only the "sporadic form of the contagious
jaundice of the tropics," or yellow fever.He bases his opinion on the
identity of their symptoms, pathological anatomy, mortality, and
contagious character; for he affirms that acute yellow atrophy may
exhibit contagious power in temperate climates.[Footnote 132: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.As acute yellow atrophy comes on as an ordinary catarrhal jaundice, it
is impossible to distinguish it from the latter affection during the
prodromal period.When cerebral symptoms, black vomit, and tarry stools
appear, the area of hepatic dulness very decidedly diminishes, and
leucin and tyrosin replace urea in the urine, acute atrophy may be
suspected.Acute phosphorus-poisoning, as regards its symptomatology and morbid
anatomy, does not differ from acute yellow atrophy, and many cases of
the latter have been mistaken, it is supposed, for the former.To
distinguish between them the history of the case must be carefully
ascertained.When, after the prodromal symptoms, which may not be accurately
diagnosticated, there occurs a rapid decline in the area of hepatic
dulness, hemorrhages take place from the mucous surfaces, stupor and
delirium {1030} supervene, and urea disappears from the urine, being
replaced by leucin and tyrosin, there can be no difficulty in coming to
a conclusion: the case must be one of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--It was formerly supposed that a case of acute yellow
atrophy must necessarily prove fatal, but this opinion must now be
modified, since examples of cure of supposed cases have been reported
from Oppolzer's clinic,[133] by Lebert,[134] by Harley,[135] and
others.As at the onset the symptoms cannot be distinguished from a
bilious attack or from catarrhal jaundice, the treatment must be
appropriate to these states.When the serious symptoms begin, a large
dose (scruple j) of quinine should be at once administered, and half
the quantity at regular intervals to keep up the cinchonism.Phosphate
of soda, with some arseniate and such mild hepatic stimulants as
euonymin, iridin, etc., should be given to maintain a gentle aperient
action.Experience has proved that active or drastic cathartics do harm
rather than good; on the other hand, mild laxatives, especially those
having cholagogue action, seem to do good.[Footnote 133: Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

[Footnote 134: _Ibid._]

[Footnote 135: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.Important symptoms arising during the toxaemic period require remedies
to combat them.Nausea and vomiting, and also diarrhoea, are best
relieved by carbolic acid and bismuth in combination.Hemorrhage
requires, when intestinal, the chloride and perchloride of iron; when
from other mucous surfaces, ergotin, gallic acid, and other
haemostatics.The depression of the vital forces should be treated by
small and frequently-repeated doses of alcohol, by quinine, by iron,
and, under some conditions, by digitalis.After the disintegration of
the hepatic cells has been produced no remedies can be of any service.Until this occurs, however, it seems to the author well worth while to
attempt to stay the destruction by the administration of those remedies
which, by their accumulation in that organ, indicate a special affinity
for its tissue.These drugs are phosphorus, antimony, gold, silver, and
mercuric chloride.By the timely administration of one or more of these
would it not be possible to stay the progress of the atrophic
degeneration?The Liver in Phosphorus-Poisoning.DEFINITION.--Poisoning by phosphorus may seem to be a toxicological
question rather than a merely hepatic disease, but as the morbid
complexus thus induced is so similar to acute yellow atrophy that the
conditions are regarded as identical by many of our German colleagues,
it is necessary to enter into some details regarding it.PATHOGENY.--Phosphorus-poisoning occurs at any period from youth to old
age, but is most common from twenty to thirty years of age.Women seem
more inclined to effect self-destruction in this way than are men,
probably because phosphorus matches are so readily obtained.Children
may munch match-heads in a spirit of mischief.That form of chronic
poisoning seen in workmen in match-factories, and consisting in
necrosis of bone, etc., does not come within the scope of the present
inquiry.A body poisoned by phosphorus does not exhibit a tendency to
putrefactive decomposition within the usual period.The tissues are
more or less {1031} deeply stained by bile-pigment, and this coloration
extends to pathological fluids as well.The serous and mucous membranes
contain points of blood-extravasation, but they are especially numerous
in the serous membranes.Hemorrhages of this kind are due to two
causes--to the disorganization of the blood, and to fatty degeneration
of the arterioles.The heart is also more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration, the muscles granular, the striations obscure or
obliterated, and the whole soft and easily torn.The spleen is usually
enlarged--often, indeed, to twice its natural size.The liver presents
highly-characteristic alterations.When death occurs early the organ is
generally enlarged, infiltrated with fat, the connective tissue
undergoing hyperplasia; but in more advanced cases atrophy has taken
place, the cells have disappeared and are replaced by fat-granules,
crystals of leucin and tyrosin, connective tissue, etc.--in fact, the
changes characteristic of acute yellow atrophy.The jaundice has been
variously interpreted.As the bile-ducts in advanced cases are found to
contain no bile, but only a colorless mucus, the advocates of a
haematogenic jaundice hold that the jaundice is due to a failure of the
liver to excrete the biliary principles in the blood; whilst the
opponents of this view maintain the existence of an obstruction in the
ultimate ducts.Harley[136] has recently brought forward some strong
facts and arguments--which we believe can be successfully
controverted--maintaining the former view.The jaundice of
phosphorus-poisoning, if Harley's opinion prove to be correct, must be
regarded as a haematogenic jaundice.[Footnote 136: _Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

The mucous membrane of the stomach, as might be supposed, is more or
less ulcerated or in an advanced state of catarrh, and the gastric
glands are affected by fatty degeneration.The kidneys are affected in a similar manner to the liver; the
epithelium is fatty and sometimes detached, and the same process is
found to occur in the vessels and epithelium of the cortex.SYMPTOMS.--Not only in the morbid anatomy, but in the symptoms, do we
find that a very remarkable resemblance exists between acute yellow
atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning.As phosphorus is usually swallowed in
bulk, some hours may elapse before the local symptoms begin, for the
contents of the stomach and the tough mucus lining the mucous membrane
may, and usually do, prevent immediate contact of the poison with the
mucous membrane.When the stomach is entirely empty the symptoms may
begin in an hour or two.The symptoms produced may be arranged in two
groups--those due to the local irritation excited by the poison; those
due to its systemic impression.In the first group belong burning in
the gullet, pain, nausea, and vomiting.According to Lewin,[137] who
has collected a number of cases for analysis, vomiting occurs in 26 out
of 32 instances of poisoning.Some hours--often, indeed, three or four
days--then elapse before the systemic symptoms begin.Vomiting, which
was for the time being suspended, occurs again, and instead of the mere
contents of the stomach, containing more or less phosphorus, blood,
somewhat changed by the gastric juice--chocolate- or as
coffee-grounds--appears in the vomited matters.The evacuations from
the bowels may at first, as the contents of the stomach, appear
phosphorescent, and afterward exhibit the appearances due to the
presence in them {1032} of altered blood.At this time, if the liver be
examined it will be found somewhat enlarged and tender to pressure, and
on or about the third day jaundice appears; but it should not be
overlooked that jaundice, as Bamberger[138] has shown, may be postponed
to the second or third week after the phosphorus has been taken.[Footnote 137: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xxi.514 _et seq._]

[Footnote 138: Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_,
_loc.cit._]

In favorable cases the area of hepatic dulness decreases and the
jaundice declines.In the fatal cases certain nervous phenomena become
prominent.There occur drowsiness, developing into coma, with
intercurrent attacks of delirium which may be of a maniacal character;
convulsions, spasmodic attacks, dilated pupils, and involuntary
evacuations.The disorganization of the blood and the fatty change in
the vessels are exhibited in the hemorrhages from the gastro-intestinal
mucous membrane.The nervous phenomena are due chiefly to the retention
in the blood of various excrementitious matters which it is the
function of the liver to separate from the blood.Flint's theory of
cholesteraemia has been so abundantly disproved that no one upholds it
at the present time, but the cerebral symptoms are properly referred to
the retention of all hepatic excrement.The temperature in phosphorus-poisoning rises from 99 degrees to 102
degrees F., but it may reach in severe cases to 103 degrees to 105
degrees F., and at death or immediately afterward to 105 degrees, even
to 107 degrees F. The same fact is true of acute yellow atrophy.With
the jaundice the pulse declines, but in the further progress of the
case, especially toward the close, the pulse becomes rapid and small.The changes occurring in the urine are highly significant.The amount
of urea decreases as the symptoms increase in severity, and leucin and
tyrosin take its place.If the case tends to recovery the urea again
increases in amount, but if the tendency is in the opposite direction
the quantity of urea steadily diminishes.Bile acids and bile-pigment
are found in quantity, and albumen is present in small amount.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Phosphorus-poisoning is necessarily
an acute affection, but the duration of cases is much influenced by the
form in which the poison is taken.If in a liquid and diffusible form,
as oleum phosphoratum, the local and systemic symptoms will develop in
a few hours, but if in solid masses, as particles of match-heads, many
hours (six to ten) may elapse before the local irritation begins.The
proportion of cures in phosphorus-poisoning varies from one-fourth to
one-half of the cases.Much depends, however, on the promptness and
efficiency of the treatment.The prognosis is the more favorable the
earlier proper measures of relief have been instituted.If the case has
proceeded to jaundice, hemorrhages, black vomit, etc.without the
administration of suitable antidotes, little can be expected from any
kind of treatment.DIAGNOSIS.--The history of any case involved in doubt is indispensable
to a correct conclusion.The phosphorescent appearance of the matters
vomited or passed by stool may make the differentiation comparatively
easy; but if the case has passed beyond this stage,
phosphorus-poisoning can be separated from acute yellow atrophy only by
the history of the case.If the fact of the administration of
phosphorus is successfully concealed, no differentiation can be made,
since {1033} even the best authorities hold to the identity of the
toxic symptoms produced by this poison and of the morbid anatomy, with
the symptoms and lesions of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--The poison should be evacuated as quickly as possible by
emetics and proper diluents.The best emetics are sulphate of copper,
apomorphia, and ipecacuanha, the antimonial and mercurial emetics being
unsuited, since their effects are similar to those of phosphorus.Oleaginous protectives do not prevent, but really favor, the absorption
of phosphorus.Decoctions of flaxseed, slippery elm, acacia, etc.are
suitable demulcents and protectives.The fatty matter in food, eggs,
etc.will have an injurious effect by promoting the solution and
absorption of the phosphorus, and should hence be excluded from the
diet.The most effective antidote is oleum terebinthinae, and the most
suitable preparation is the French acid oil.Freshly-distilled
turpentine appears to be almost if not entirely useless.It is probable
that the American oil which is old and has been exposed to the air for
many months will answer the purpose, but it cannot be too strongly
insisted on that the turpentine which has proved to be efficient in
phosphorus-poisoning is the French acid oil.Turpentine when exposed to
the air absorbs oxygen as ozone, and to this principle are probably due
the curative effects of old turpentine.Phosphorus when acted on by
this agent is converted into a spermaceti-like substance entirely
devoid of toxic power.As rapidly as possible the poison should be
acted on by the antidote, and then the stomach should be evacuated,
using, caeteris paribus, the sulphate of copper, since this forms an
insoluble phosphide with any portion of free phosphorus, whilst at the
same time it empties the stomach of its contents.Although the
immediate results of the poison may be thus removed, the damage to the
red corpuscles and to the whole mass of the blood requires special
management.The success of transfusion, as practised by Jurgensen,[139]
proves that the substitution of fresh blood may save life when the
existing blood-supply is inadequate to the performance of its proper
functions.It follows that if the toxic effects of phosphorus have
continued for several days, blood-transfusion will be necessary in
those cases characterized by an inability to recuperate notwithstanding
the successful removal of the poison.[Footnote 139: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, No.For the inflammatory symptoms produced by the local action of
phosphorus, opium in some form is indispensable.This remedy is equally
valuable as a means of maintaining the vital resources and to prevent
the evil results of shock and inflammation.DEFINITION.--Under the term carcinoma of the liver are included primary
and secondary cancer of the liver.The malady with which we are now
concerned is the primary affection, occurring in the organ proper or in
some pathological new formation connected with it.ETIOLOGY.--Heredity is the most important factor.A careful
investigation of the reported examples demonstrates that from 15 to 20
per cent.owe their origin to hereditary influence clearly, and
probably {1034} considerably more are indirectly derived in this way
when the immediate connection may not be demonstrable.Next to
heredity, age must be regarded as the most important pathogenetic
influence, much the largest number occurring at from forty to sixty
years of age.It is a malady of advanced life, therefore, rather than
of youth or middle age.Excluding the female organs from consideration,
it is quite certain that sex has little special influence, and that
males and females are affected about equally.Primary cancer of the liver is comparatively infrequent, occurring in
not more than one-fourth of the cases.Frerichs collected 91 cases, and
of these 46 were secondary to cancer in organs having vascular
communication with the liver.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Under the term cancer of the liver are included
several distinct forms of morbid growth, but united in the
characteristic of malignancy.From the merely clinical standpoint this
characteristic is the most decisive bond of union between them, and
serves as the point of departure in the study of this affection.Primary cancer of the liver is divisible into two forms: 1, as a
single, defined tumor; 2, as an infiltration through the whole mass of
the organ.[140] Secondary cancer occurs in nodular masses, and with
extreme rarity as an infiltration.The form of cancer is really the
same; the differences in structure are only apparent, the variations
being due to the relative proportion of cells, fibres, and vessels.If
the fibrous stroma is abundant and the cells small in quantity, the
form of structure approaches scirrhus; on the other hand, if the cells
largely preponderate, the type is encephaloid; if vessels predominate,
it is called telangiectatic.The usual form in cancer of the liver is
the soft, cellular variety, encephaloid or medullary.When the
cancerous new formation is nodular, the masses vary in size from a pea
to a child's head,[141] and are numerous inversely as their size.When
the cancer occurs as a solitary tumor, it may attain to enormous
dimensions.It has a spherical shape usually, protrudes from the
surface of the organ somewhat irregularly, and the overlying peritoneum
is thickened, cloudy, and adherent from a local inflammation.The
central portion, whether there be one, several, or many nodules, is
depressed, giving an umbilicated appearance to the tumor; and this
central depression is found to be soft, almost diffluent, and full of
juice.The fibrous stroma which extends through this central soft
material has a reticulated arrangement and a shining, fibrous
appearance.The cancerous masses are not confined to these nodules, but
extend into the surrounding hepatic structure, push their way into the
portal (especially the hepatic) veins, block the ducts, and invade the
lymphatic glands in the fissure of the liver.[Footnote 140: Virchow, _Krankhaften Geschwulste_, _loc.cit._; Perls,
_Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.448 _et seq._;
Frerichs, _A Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.281 _et seq._]

[Footnote 141: Forster, _Lehrbuch der Pathologischen Anatomie_, by
Seibert, Jena, 1873.]When the cancerous new formation takes the form of an infiltration of
the organ instead of distinct nodules, the liver is usually uniformly
enlarged and its outlines preserved.[142] The peritoneum is opaque,
thickened, and adherent.The organ is traversed by fibrous bands, and
the {1035} intervening portion is a soft, juicy pulp, stained by the
imbibition of bile.In extreme cases hardly any portion of the proper
hepatic tissue remains, but is replaced by a cancerous new formation
having the same shape.[Footnote 142: Perls, _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lvi.448 _et seq._]

As regards the minute structure of cancer of the liver, it may be
regarded as a degeneration (cancerous) of the proper gland-cells and of
the epithelium of the bile-ducts.As cancer develops in the liver it is
to be noted that the cellular elements preponderate over the fibrous or
the stroma, and hence the new formation presents the characteristics of
softness, rapid growth, and a multitudinous cellular hyperplasia.As
regards the form of the new cells, it cannot now be doubted that they
are descendants of the secretory gland-cells and of the epithelial
lining of the ducts.According to some observers, it is to the
proliferation of the proper gland-cells that the new formations owe
their origin; according to others, to the hyperplasia of the cells
lining the ducts.As the growth of the new formation can take place
only through an adequate blood-supply, it becomes very important to
ascertain its source.There can be little doubt that primary cancer of
the liver receives its nutrient supply through the hepatic artery, in
connection with which new capillaries form in the pathological tissue.Secondary cancer of the liver is the usual form of the specific
manifestation.From the merely clinical standpoint the primary
affection is the more important.From the pathological point of view
the secondary implication of the liver may be a true metastasis or a
mere communication by contiguity of tissue.The most usual metastasis
occurs from epithelial cancer of the face (Schuppel), but the ordinary
communication of the new formation is from primary cancer of the
stomach, intestine, pancreas, mesentery, etc.The cancer elements, as
the author has several times verified, crowd the lymphatics and veins,
and through these channels reach the liver and other parts.As the
cancer elements in the case of secondary implication of the liver are
distributed chiefly by the portal vein, it follows that there must be
numerous secondary foci and multiple nodes.Cancerous infiltration
under these circumstances is the rarest possible form for the new
growth to take.The size and number of nodes forming in these cases of
secondary implication of the organ vary greatly--from two or three to
twenty, or a hundred, or even more.As regards the form, structure, and
ultimate behavior of the secondary formation, they do not differ from
the primary.As respects the relative proportion of stroma and cellular
elements--fibres and cells--they vary greatly, some presenting the firm
texture of a predominating fibrous stroma, others the softness and
ready diffluence of the excessive cellular production.The latter is
undoubtedly the usual condition, and when the nodular masses are
incised an abundant creamy juice exudes.With the development of these
nodules an increase in the size of the liver takes place and the organ
has an uneven and indurated feel.As the cancerous masses develop the
proper hepatic structure undergoes atrophy, and finally little is left
of the organ but the cancerous new formation.The blood-vessels,
lymphatics, and peritoneal investment are invaded, the first mentioned
most decidedly; and especially are organized exudations the favorite
seats of cancer new formations, those, for example, about the
gall-bladder and cystic duct resulting from repeated attacks of passage
of calculi.{1036} Secondary changes take place in the cancerous nodes.As the
cells develop pressure is brought to bear on the vessels supplying them
and on each other, with the result of fatty degeneration of the central
portion, which effects the change in the form of the nodules and in
their consistence, already mentioned.The blood-supply to the cancerous
nodes in the liver is derived from the hepatic artery, as Frerichs has
determined by carefully-made injections; they also are new formations
of exceedingly delicate structure, and form a network about the
periphery of each mass or node.By reference to these anatomical
considerations it is easy to understand the failure of nutrition of the
central portions of the nodes.Pigment cancers of the liver are rare as secondary formations, and
excessively infrequent as primary formations.They are, properly
speaking, melano-sarcomas (Schuppel).They are more often metastatic
than merely secondary--that is, transferred from different parts, as in
the case of melanotic sarcoma of the choroid--than due to neighboring
disease transferred by contiguity of tissue.This variety of cancer, so
called, takes the form of multiple nodes or of diffused infiltration,
the former more frequently; but both modes of development may go on at
the same time.The nodes vary in size from a pea to a child's head,
have a grayish, brownish, or blackish tint, and exude on section a
fluid not creamy like true cancer-juice, but rather watery and
containing black particles floating in it.In the case of diffuse
infiltration the pigment masses are thoroughly distributed through the
original hepatic tissue.In both forms the size and weight of the organ
are enormously increased.In the case of the melanotic infiltration the
whole organ is uniformly enlarged, reaching in a few months the
enormous size of twelve to twenty pounds.Sarcomas also occur very rarely as primary growths in the liver, but
secondary sarcomas are more frequent.There are fibro-sarcoma,
lympho-sarcoma, and osteo-sarcoma as secondary deposits, the first
being very firm in consistence, the second soft and medullary, and the
last of hard, bony consistence.SYMPTOMS.--We are especially concerned here with primary cancer of the
liver.The secondary disease is so obscured by the main and primary
lesion that a diagnosis may be impossible.Furthermore, the progress of
the original disease is that which demands immediate consideration.As,
therefore, the secondary implication of the liver is of relatively
trifling importance, and only an incident in the course of the main
disease, the matter for consideration now is primary cancer of the
liver.It is the fact that in some, even a considerable proportion, of the
cases the onset and progress of cancer of the liver are very obscure.For some time the symptoms may be of the vaguest description.The usual
history is this: A person of forty to sixty years begins to fail in
flesh and strength, becomes sallow, has disorders of digestion, pain
and uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, and the bowels are now
confined, now relaxed.The abdomen, notwithstanding the general loss of
flesh, increases in size, and the superficial veins are enlarged; very
considerable pain is experienced in the right hypochondrium, and often
extreme tenderness to pressure is a pronounced symptom.The pains are
not limited to the hepatic region, out extend widely from this point in
all directions.On palpation the {1037} liver is found to be enlarged,
its texture indurated, and its outline irregular and nodular, and
pain--often, indeed, quite severe--is developed by pressure.The condition of the liver on palpation is best ascertained by suddenly
depressing the abdominal wall with the tips of the fingers arranged in
a line.Displacing thus the movable bodies in the cavity, the liver is
quickly reached, and nodules, if they exist, are readily felt.If the
new formation has developed from exudations about the gall-bladder and
cystic duct, it may be felt by suddenly depressing the walls of the
abdomen over this organ in the usual position of the fissure.In the case of general cancerous infiltration of the organ, with the
remarkable enlargement which occurs in such cases, there will be
present an obvious distension of the right hypochondrium; the
intercostal spaces will be forced outward and the arches of the ribs
rendered more prominent; the area of hepatic dulness, both vertical and
transverse, will be increased; and the limits of dulness will move with
a full inspiration downward, and with a full expiration upward.This
mobility of cancer-nodules of the liver with the inspiratory and
expiratory changes serves to distinguish them from tumors of the
abdominal walls.Seen early, the changes in the size of a nodule or of
the liver itself may be noted from week to week,[143] especially in
cases of rapidly-growing cancer.[Footnote 143: Murchison, _Clinical Lectures_, p.As the cancerous new formations extend into the portal system within
the liver, obstruction to the portal circulation results from the
blocking of the blood-current.Also, interference in the portal
circulation arises by compression of the vessels from without, either
through the accumulation of cancer-products in the liver or by the
enlargement of the lymphatics in the fissure of the organ.In what way
soever it may be produced, the practical fact remains that ascites is a
frequent symptom, occurring in somewhat more than one-half of the
cases.It may be a clear serum
containing a small proportion of albumen; it may be  by bile or
be of a deeper greenish or reddish hue; it may contain flocculi of
lymph and numerous leucocytes floating in it; and the ordinary serum
may be rendered cloudy and be filled with shreds of exudation in
consequence of peritonitis, or bloody because of hemorrhage from a
softening nodule.When the fluid is considerable in amount the
difficulty of ascertaining the condition of the liver is greatly
enhanced, and symptoms due to the interference of the fluid with the
action of various organs are introduced into the complexus of morbid
signs.Especially is the upward pressure of the ascitic fluid, and the
consequent interference in the movements of the lungs and heart, a
source of considerable distress.First, a local and afterward a general
peritonitis ensues as a consequence of the extension outwardly of the
new formations to the peritoneal layer, and its implication by
contiguity of tissue or the rupture of a spreading fungous growth and
hemorrhagic extravasation into the cavity.The peritoneal complication
is not only a serious addition to the sufferings experienced by the
patient, but it adds to the difficulties of a diagnosis.In the case of
a celebrated savant who died of cancer of the liver (seen by the
writer) there was such a pronounced peritonitis that the diagnosis made
by the attending physician was chronic peritonitis.When this
complication occurs, there takes place {1038} a decided increase in the
local tenderness, and this increased sensibility to pressure quickly
extends over the abdomen, causing a general exquisite tenderness.Besides this tenderness characteristic of most cases of peritonitis,
distension of the abdomen and the decubitus peculiar to this state are
obvious symptoms.It is therefore clear that the occurrence of
peritonitis not only contributes to the severity and painfulness of the
case, but seriously complicates the diagnosis.It has been already stated that pain in the right hypochondrium is a
nearly constant symptom in cancer of the liver.With the initial
symptoms, uneasiness, heaviness, a sense of pressure in the hepatic
region are experienced, and as the case progresses more or less acute
pain develops as a rule.In cases of cancer
involving the deeper portion of the liver there may be little pain, and
in some rare cases of cancer involving the external part of the
liver--the capsule and peritoneum--but little pain is experienced.In
much the largest proportion of cases the pain is severe, and the
production of any considerable pain means the implication of the
hepatic plexus of nerves or the hepatic peritoneum.It follows, then,
that the pain in the former case is not limited to the locality of the
disease, but is more or less widely distributed through the anatomical
relations of the hepatic plexus, being felt in the epigastrium, the
walls of the chest, the shoulders, etc.In secondary cancer of the liver, following cancer of the stomach,
vomiting is a constant symptom, but also in those cases of primary
disease in which the left lobe is especially enlarged, relatively, are
nausea and vomiting pronounced symptoms.At the onset of the malady the
appetite fails and a gastro-intestinal catarrh is set up.More or less
catarrh of the bile-ducts also ensues.The interference with nutrition
thus occasioned is enhanced in those cases in which the obstruction of
the ducts is sufficient to prevent the escape of bile into the
intestine.Jaundice is not a constant symptom, occurring in little more
than one-third of the cases.When it occurs, the peculiar stools are
present and the intestinal digestion is deranged, as in cases of
ordinary obstruction to the ducts.In two cases of cancer of the liver
occurring in the writer's practice, and examined by post-mortem, there
were calculi present in the gall-bladder; in one case the principal
calculus was egg-shaped and the size of a pullet's egg.The nutrition rapidly fails from the beginning of cancer of the liver.The downward pace is accelerated when the gastro-intestinal digestion
fails and vomiting occurs after taking food.The skin becomes dry and
wrinkled, and if not jaundiced has a peculiar tint, varying in depth of
color from an earthy or fawn-like hue to a deep bronze.Failure of
strength is a pronounced symptom from the beginning, and is out of
proportion to the loss of flesh.As the wasting advances the decline of
strength is accounted for, but the feeling of weakness and the distaste
for exertion which occur so early are very significant signs of
internal cancer, although they do not indicate the position of the
neoplasm.The urine declines in amount as the case progresses.It is usually very
high-, contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, and other
forms of pigment produced by conditions not at present known.Sometimes
albumen is present, and leucin and tyrosin rarely.{1039} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As has been already set
forth, cancer of the liver may present so few really distinctive
symptoms as to escape recognition.Under favorable circumstances the
diagnosis may be comparatively easy.In forming an opinion it is useful
to review the whole course of the malady and draw conclusions not only
from the characteristic signs, but from the development of the symptoms
as a whole.A case of cancer of the liver occurs usually after the middle period of
life.The person so affected begins to decline in flesh and strength,
has uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, disorders of digestion, and
begins to have a pallid or earthy hue of the countenance.Presently,
much pain is felt in the hepatic region, the organ distinctly enlarges,
and some effusion of fluid and much flatus increase the dimensions of
the abdomen.Much tenderness, often exquisite sensibility, is produced
by pressure over the liver, and often over the whole abdomen.By
careful palpation nodules can be made out and their growth noted in
those cases free from peritoneal inflammation.The abdominal swelling
and tenderness incommodes the lungs, and a semi-erect decubitus is
assumed to relieve the pressure on them; the breathing becomes short,
catching, hurried, and painful, and sometimes a most distressing
hiccough is superadded to the other sufferings.Jaundice appears, or the earthy hue of the skin deepens
into a bronze discoloration.The case may be terminated by some
intercurrent disease--by an attack of pleuritis, pneumonia, by
peritonitis from rupture or perforation, by intra-peritoneal
hemorrhage, by an exhausting diarrhoea.The natural termination is by
gradual failure of the powers, by marasmus, the immediate cause of
death being due to cerebral anaemia, to failure of the heart from fatty
degeneration of the cardiac muscle, from thrombosis of the portal vein,
from the development of a hemorrhagic state, and hemorrhages from the
various mucous surfaces, etc.The duration is much influenced also by
the character of the cancer, whether scirrhous or medullary.The latter
are not only more rapidly growing, more destructive of the hepatic
tissue, and more rapidly distributed to neighboring organs, but more
quickly perforate the capsule and excite a fatal result by hemorrhage
or by peritonitis.The average duration of cancer of the liver is
variously stated.Having reference to my own personal observation,
controlled by the experience of other observers, the duration is from
three to nine months, one year being exceptional.There are cases in
which the symptoms are very acute, the progress rapid, the whole course
from the initial symptoms to the termination being completed in from
two to three months.It need hardly be observed that no case of cancer
of the liver has been cured.If
any case has seemed to be cured, it may be asserted with confidence
that cancer of the liver did not exist.DIAGNOSIS.--The differential diagnosis is concerned, first, with the
existence of cancer; second, with its form.As cancer causes
enlargement of the liver in two textural conditions--namely, uniformly
smooth, and nodular--it must be differentiated from other diseases
producing similar results.Amyloid disease and echinococcus cysts
present us types of the former; cirrhosis and syphilis, of the latter.The history of the amyloid disease and of the echinococcus cyst is very
different, and both {1040} develop much more slowly.Amyloid disease of
the liver arises simultaneously with the same form of degeneration in
other organs, and is connected with suppurative disease of some kind,
with syphilis, with chronic malarial poisoning, etc., and may occur at
any age.Echinococcus cysts enlarge painlessly and do not impair the
vital forces; the liver is elastic, and under favorable circumstances
presents by palpation the purring-tremor symptom.Cirrhosis may have to
be differentiated at two periods--during the time of enlargement,
which, however, is rather brief; and during the stage of contraction
and nodulation.The history in cancer and in cirrhosis is different:
the age, the habits of life, the rate of hepatic change, are opposed in
the two diseases; the diminution in size with nodulation is
characteristic of cirrhosis; enlargement with nodulation belongs to
cancer.The rapid progress of cancer, the wasting, the debility, the
cachexia, serve to distinguish it from all other affections of the
liver except acute yellow atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning; both,
however, are so different in history and development as not to require
differentiation.It may be quite impossible in latent cases to
distinguish primary cancer of the liver from secondary, but in those
examples of the disease occurring in the stomach, intestines, and
pancreas there is usually an antecedent history of the primary malady
which distinctly separates it in point of time and the character of the
symptoms from the secondary implication of the liver.Cancer of the
gall-bladder, and especially of the organized exudation about it, may
not be readily separated from cancer of the pancreas or of the
duodenum.In doubtful cases the history of attacks of hepatic colic
becomes an important element in making the differentiation.TREATMENT.--As we are not in possession of a cure for cancer, the
treatment of cancer of the liver must be palliative.Anodynes to
relieve pain, paracentesis of the abdomen to remove accumulation of
fluid which causes distress, carbolic acid to check nausea and
vomiting, and the usual haemostatics for hemorrhage, are the measures
most necessary.In fact, the treatment must be throughout
symptomatic--for the relief of symptoms as they arise.DEFINITION.--By amyloid liver is meant a deposit in the cells of the
organ, in its vessels and interstitial tissue, of a peculiar albuminoid
matter called amyloid because of a superficial resemblance to
starch-granules.Various designations have been applied to this
condition of the organ; thus it has been entitled waxy liver and
lardaceous liver, because of the apparent resemblance to wax and lard
respectively.CAUSES.--There exists in the blood a peculiar material, albuminoid in
form, applied in the normal state to the structure of
tissue--dystropodextrin, as it is called by Seegen--which, when
precipitated under certain conditions not now known, assumes the
peculiar appearance with which we are now familiar under the term
amyloid.The character of the amyloid matter was first distinctly set
forth in 1858 by Virchow, who also discovered the characteristic
reaction by which it can always be detected.The reaction to iodine
gave to the material the designation amyloid, or starch-like, by which
it is chiefly known.The {1041} circumstances inducing the deposit of
this material are by no means clearly understood.It has long been
known that suppuration, especially in connection with bone, has had a
distinct influence.Syphilis, especially the tertiary lesions
accompanied by pus-formation, has an evident causative relation.Chronic malarial infection has a more distant and doubtful, but still
recognized, power to develop this morbid state.Of the various causes
above mentioned, the most frequent is the suppuration of pulmonary
cavities.In regard to the influence of this, however, it must be
remembered that no form of suppurative disease is so common.The
relative frequency of the association between suppurating cavities and
amyloid disease is not greater than long-standing necrosis with an
extensive sequestrum is with the same state; but the actual number of
the former is greater.Amyloid disease of the liver is most frequent
between the ages of ten and thirty, but it may occur at any age, the
period in life being determined by the operation of the causes.Thus,
Frerichs' statistics are: under ten there were 3 cases, from ten to
twenty there were 19, and from twenty to fifty there were 37 cases.Men
are, relatively to sex, more frequently attacked, and in the proportion
of three-fourths, but this difference means, of course, the character
of men's occupations and their greater liability thereby to the
accidents and diseases incident to such employments.Besides the pathogenetic factors above mentioned, it may be well to
refer in this connection to the effect of long-standing neoplasms.It
has been found that amyloid disease is produced in some subjects by the
cachexia resulting from the slow development and persistence of such a
new formation.The special character of the neoplasm is of less
importance in respect to this condition than the constitutional
condition--the cachexia--induced by its slow growth and interference
with nutrition.Although long-standing disease, especially of a
suppurative kind, is known to be necessary to cause amyloid disease,
Cohnheim[144] has lately published some facts which seem to prove that
the degeneration may occur more speedily than has been heretofore
supposed.He has shown, contrary to the previously-accepted view, that
amyloid degeneration may follow in three months after the reception of
a gunshot wound.He records three cases in which the amyloid deposits
ensued in six, five, and three months, respectively.[Footnote 144: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.271 _et seq._, "Zur
Kentniss der Amyloidentartung."]According to the author's observation, a peculiar somatic type is
either necessary to, or at least is greatly promotive of, the amyloid
degeneration.If, for example, the same suppurative process occurs in a
person of a blond and lymphatic type and in another of brunette and
nervo-muscular type, the former will be much more likely to suffer from
amyloid change than the latter."The gelatinous progeny of albuminous
parents" is the mode of expression used to designate this particular
type.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--To use the term amyloid liver is rather
misleading, since this indicates the restriction of the morbid process
to the liver, whereas it is perfectly well known to be rather widely
distributed through various organs and tissues of the body.The term
amyloid is itself confusing, since the albuminoid material so
designated is not really starch-like.The corpora amylacea, so called,
differ materially from starch-granules, and still more from the amyloid
matter.According to {1042} Wagner,[145] these substances "have nothing
in common."In the study of the amyloid deposit it has not been
possible to separate it from the tissue in which it is imbedded; hence
the published analyses of this peculiar material are probably far from
correct.However, it has been rendered probable that the amyloid
deposit has close affinities with fibrin.One of the theories--that of
Dickinson of London--assumes that this material is fibrin deprived of
the potash associated intimately with it.According to Seegen,
dystropodextrin, a material existing in normal blood, agrees with
amyloid matter in its most essential characteristics.Although
Dickinson's theory is not tenable, it has served a useful purpose in
showing the close affinity of fibrin with this pathological product.What view soever may be entertained of its nature, it is certain that
the material to which we apply the term amyloid is of albuminous
origin.Under circumstances with which we are now unacquainted this
material is deposited from the vessels, and, instead of undergoing
organization and contributing to the structure of tissues, remains
unorganized and unappropriated.It is known that this deposition of the
amyloid material is related to the process of suppuration and to
certain cachexiae, but the intermediate steps remain unknown and
inexplicable.[Footnote 145: _A Manual of General Pathology_, by Prof.325 _et seq._]

The amyloid matter is first exuded into the coats of the finest
ramifications of the hepatic artery, and therefore the first appearance
of the disease is in the middle zone of the lobules.In this respect
pathologists are agreed: that the amyloid deposits first appear in the
walls of the vessels.Wagner maintained, in opposition to Virchow, that
the exudation is limited to the vessels and does not extend to the
hepatic cells, which perish by pressure and consequent atrophy.It seems most probable, however, that
the ramifications of the hepatic artery and all the capillaries of the
lobule are affected, and that the deposits in them lead to atrophic
degeneration of the cells.In consequence of this extensive implication of the vascular system of
the liver important changes occur in the size, density, and appearance
of the liver.The organ is greatly enlarged in all its diameters.When
felt through the walls of the abdomen its outline is distinct, it is
firm, even hard, to the sense of touch, and it projects from a finger's
breadth to a hand's breadth below the margin of the ribs.The increase
of size of the amyloid liver is very great, attaining in weight, on the
average, twice that of the normal organ; but this size may be largely
exceeded in exceptional instances.In respect to shape and outline the
amyloid liver does not differ from the normal organ; for although its
dimensions are increased, its relations to the parts adjacent are not
altered.The weight of the amyloid liver may reach ten, twelve, even
sixteen pounds avoirdupois.The color of the amyloid liver is very
different from that of the normal organ: instead of having the
reddish-brown tint, it becomes grayish, yellowish, or reddish-gray.In
consistence the amyloid liver is firm and rather elastic and doughy,
and on section the margins of the incision are well defined, even
sharp.A very characteristic feature of the cut surface is its
paleness, anaemia, or bloodlessness, and scarcely any blood is exuded,
even from the large vessels.The appearance of the incised surface of
the liver has been described by comparison with various substances:
according to one, it is waxy; according to another, it is lardaceous.A
thin {1043} section of a part of the liver far advanced in the amyloid
change is distinctly translucent, almost transparent; but a marked
difference is observable between the amyloid matter and the lobules
proper, even in the cases of extreme deposit.The lobules are separated
by an opaque yellow border, and the centre of each is marked by a spot
of a similar yellow color.The amyloid material is remarkable for its power to resist the action
of chemical agents and putrefactive decomposition.The test originally
proposed by Virchow--iodine--continues to be the most characteristic.Orth[146] suggests a method of applying it which is very excellent in
respect to the clearness with which the reaction is shown: A large,
thin section of the affected liver is placed in a saucer of water
containing some iodine, and after the reaction has taken place is laid
on a white plate.Iodine tincture, diluted or the compound solution, is
brushed over the affected region, when the amyloid matter assumes a
deep mahogany tint and the normal tissues a merely yellowish hue.The
distinctness of the reaction may be increased by brushing over the
iodized surface some dilute sulphuric acid, when the amyloid matter
takes a deep violet, almost black, color.[Footnote 146: _Diagnosis in Pathological Anatomy_, Riverside Press,
1878, p.Only a part of the organ--namely, the smaller vessels--may be involved
in the degeneration, and this may be restricted to patches or parts of
the organ.With the amyloid change there may be associated syphilitic
gummata, or the liver may be more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration or in cirrhosis.Those parts of the organ not invaded by
the disease are not often entirely normal; they are more or less
darkened in color by venous congestion, distinctly softer, etc.The
amyloid change is not limited to the liver, but extends to the kidneys,
lymphatic glands, the intestinal mucous membrane, etc.SYMPTOMS.--As the amyloid change in the liver is usually coincident
with a simultaneous alteration of other organs, and as the deposits
characteristic of the affection are dependent on long-previous disease
of an exhausting kind, it is not surprising that the subjects of this
affection present the evidences of a cachexia.To the effects of a
chronic malady we have added the complications growing out of the
amyloid change in the liver, associated, as it usually is, with amyloid
degeneration of other important organs.The symptomatic expression of amyloid liver is therefore mixed up with
various derangements that occur simultaneously, but especially with the
causes inducing the existing cachexia, with chronic suppuration of
pulmonary cavities, or in connection with diseased bone, with the
syphilitic cachexia, or with chronic malarial toxaemia.With what cause
soever the cachexia may be associated, the symptomatology of amyloid
liver is secondary to, or ingrafted on, the conditions produced by the
cachexia.The liver is enlarged in all well-marked cases from a
finger's breadth to a hand's breadth or more below the inferior margin
of the ribs; it is also firm to the touch, well defined, elastic, and
its margin rounded, but yet well defined.There is usually no
tenderness nor pain, and, without any uneasy sensations to indicate the
change taking place, the organ is found to have slowly enlarged,
sometimes to an extraordinary extent.Careful palpation may also
demonstrate an enlargement of the spleen.When the abdominal muscles
are relaxed and there is no swelling of the abdomen by flatus or
peritoneal effusion, the very considerable enlargement of {1044} the
liver can be readily ascertained.If the effusion is not so great as to
distend the abdomen unduly, the increased consistence and dimensions of
the liver can still be made out with comparative ease.The hepatic
functions are not always sufficiently disturbed to produce
characteristic symptoms.In a small proportion--scarcely one-tenth--of
the cases does jaundice appear, and when present it is due, usually, to
enlargement of the lymphatics in the hilus of the organ, and thus
directly compressing the hepatic duct.In the writer's experience,
although jaundice has not occurred, there was present a peculiar dark
earthy or bronzed tint of the skin, significant of chronic hepatic
troubles.Obstruction of the portal circulation is rather unusual, and
the explanation is to be found in the fact that the amyloid
degeneration occurs first in the radicles of the hepatic artery.In
about one-fourth of the cases ascites is present, but in a somewhat
larger proportion hemorrhoids, blackish, tarry stools, and other
evidences of portal congestion.When the intestinal arterioles are
attacked, an intractable colliquative diarrhoea comes on; the stools
are offensive, sometimes light from the absence of bile, sometimes dark
from decomposition or the presence of blood.When the stomach
arterioles are also involved, which is usual under these circumstances,
the blandest and simplest articles of diet will pass unchanged or
simply decomposed.Blood may be vomited sometimes in large quantity
from thrombic ulcers, but the matter ejected from the stomach when the
case is well advanced is a thin, watery fluid, faintly acid or neutral,
and greenish or brownish in color.An enlarged spleen is often present, produced by the same
conditions--by amyloid degeneration.The same change taking place in
the kidney, the urine becomes pale, abundant, of low specific gravity,
and albuminous.General dropsy supervenes in a majority of the cases
finally, due largely to the hydraemia; and of this condition ascites is
a part.In some cases enlargement of the abdomen is the first step in
the dropsical effusion, and may throughout be the most prominent, as
the author has seen.In other cases oedema of the feet and legs is the
first evidence of dropsy; in still others the dropsy is general from
the beginning.Amyloid liver may coexist with a fairly good state of the bodily
nutrition, but if digestion and assimilation be interfered with by any
of the causes above mentioned, the strength rapidly declines and
emaciation reaches an extreme degree.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As amyloid liver is never a
substantive affection, but secondary to some constitutional malady or
to long-continued suppuration, its course must be considered in
relation to the agency producing it.It is very silent in its origin
and progress, and causes no pronounced symptoms until it attains
considerable size and its functions are interfered with by the extent
of the deposits.The history of the affection to which it is secondary
therefore precedes the onset of the amyloid change and accompanies it
throughout.The enlarged organ, with the results of its enlargement in
altered functions of the abdominal organs, is a symptom superadded to
existing disturbances.The period elapsing in the course of a chronic
suppurative disease before the amyloid change occurs differs greatly in
different cases, and may be stated as from three months (Cohnheim's
case) to many years.Many of the cases terminate by an intercurrent
disease; others by uraemic {1045} convulsions; a very few by hemorrhage
from the stomach or intestines; and those pursuing their course
uninterruptedly, by exhaustion.By some a cure at the beginning of
the morbid deposits is regarded as possible, and examples of cures have
been reported.The writer has seen supposed cases of amyloid liver
terminate in recovery.There must always remain an impression that in
such instances an error of diagnosis was committed.Those of syphilitic
origin are probably more curable, but syphiloma of the liver may be
confounded with amyloid disease, and hence the cure may be referred to
the latter.DIAGNOSIS.--Amyloid degeneration of the liver may be confounded with
the various non-febrile enlargements of the organ.An important element
in making the differentiation is the history of suppuration in
connection with bone, with lung cavities, with constitutional syphilis,
with chronic malarial toxaemia, etc.From fatty liver, amyloid
degeneration is distinguished by the history as just sketched; by the
fatty tendencies of the body in the former, emaciation in the latter;
by the concomitant changes in the spleen, kidneys, and elsewhere; and
by the subsequent history, fatty liver terminating by a weak heart
usually, whilst the amyloid disease ends in the modes described in the
preceding paragraph.From hydatid disease, amyloid liver is
differentiated by the history, by the difference in the physical
characteristics of the enlargement, by the presence of the purring
tremor in the one, its absence in the other, and especially by the
subsequent course.In all doubtful cases the use of an aspirator-needle
and the withdrawal of some fluid containing the characteristic hooklets
of the echinococcus will serve to determine the nature of the growth.From cancer, amyloid liver is separated by the previous history, by the
nodular character of the enlargement, by the pain, and by the cachexia
and associated derangements.Whilst amyloid liver is secondary to
suppurative diseases, cancer is usually secondary to cancer of the
stomach or other organ within the limits of the portal circulation.TREATMENT.--As amyloid disease owes its origin to syphilis, to chronic
malarial toxaemia, to suppuration, these, so far as they are remediable
conditions, should be cured as speedily as may be, to prevent the
development of the amyloid disease or to arrest it if begun.Unfortunately, the condition of the liver is not recognized until the
morbid change is effected, and therefore practically irremediable.The treatment necessarily involves that of the morbid state to which
the amyloid deposits are owing.The syphilitic disease requires iodine
and mercury; the malarial, quinine, iodine and the iodides, eucalyptus,
iron, etc., according to the state of each case; and surgical diseases,
especially necrosis of bone, should be effectively treated by suitable
surgical expedients.The cause being removed if possible, what means,
if any, can be resorted to to cause the absorption of the amyloid
matter?The only specific plan of treatment hitherto proposed is that
of Dickinson,[147] based on his theory of the constitution of amyloid
matter; according to which the amyloid deposits consist of fibrin
altered by the separation of the potash and soda salts, which have been
eliminated in the pus.If this theory be admitted, the obvious
indication is to supply the alkaline materials.The cases reported by
Dickinson in which this theory was {1046} practically demonstrated were
not sufficiently improved to lend any empirical support to this method.[Footnote 147: _The Pathology and Treatment of Albuminuria_, p.214 _et
seq._]

The medicinal remedies which do any good are the iodides--notably the
iodides of ammonium, of iron, of manganese, etc., the compound solution
of iodine, and the double iodide of iron and manganese.As the
officinal ointment of the red iodide of mercury, rubbed in over the
splenic region, does so much good in chronic enlargement of the spleen,
it is probable that it will prove effective in this form of enlargement
of the liver.The writer has observed results from it in such cases
that justify him in strongly urging its employment.The method of its
application consists in rubbing perseveringly a piece of the ointment,
a large pea in size, over the whole hepatic area, and repeating it
daily until some irritation and desquamation of the skin is produced,
when it should be suspended until the parts will bear renewed
applications.Besides the topical application of the red iodide, this
remedy may be given internally with advantage without reference to
syphilitic infection.It seems to the writer probable that bichloride
of mercury may be as useful, as it is certainly more manageable.The
chloride of gold and sodium, arsenic in small doses, and the metallic
tonics, so called, may be useful carefully administered, especially the
first mentioned, which the writer believes has some real power over the
disease.As the hepatic functions are
much disturbed, if not entirely suspended, it is necessary to give
those foods which are converted into peptones in the stomach.As a
rule, fats, starches, and sweets are mischievous, and milk, meats,
oysters, and the nitrogenous foods best adapted to nourish the patient.If the diarrhoea should prove exhausting, the mineral acids, with
opium, are the best remedies.Nausea and vomiting are best relieved by
carbolic acid mixture, and hemorrhages by the solution of the chloride
or subsulphate of iron.Fatty Liver; Fatty Degeneration of the Liver (Hepar Adiposum).DEFINITION.--By the term fatty liver is meant a change in the organ
characterized by the excessive quantity of fat- or oil-globules
contained in the cells of the parenchyma.CAUSES.--The liver acts, under normal conditions, as a reservoir for
the surplus fat, which it gives out as the demand is made.It is not
only the fat brought to the liver by the blood which accumulates in the
organ, but it apparently possesses the power to transform certain
substances--albumen, for example--into fat.An important causative
element, therefore, is the quantity of fat present in the food
habitually consumed.This has been proved by the investigations of
Radziejewsky[148] and others, who have shown that the fat in the food
is stored up in the normal places of deposit, one of which, of course,
is the liver.Another causative element is the formation of fat from
the albumen of the hepatic cells in consequence of diminished
oxidation.In respect to both causes the consumption of oxygen is an
important factor.The insufficient supply of oxygen {1047} which is a
necessary result of a sedentary life leads thus, directly, to the
accumulation of fat in the liver-cells.A constitutional predisposition
is also an important factor.There are those who under certain
conditions of daily life store up large supplies of fat, and others who
under the same conditions continue lean.Women more than men are
subject to such inherited predispositions.[Footnote 148: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.Again, fatty liver occurs in the course of certain cachexiae, notably
phthisis.In this case the obstructive pulmonary lesions interfere with
the process of oxidation, and also maintain a constant hyperaemia of
the portal system.This condition of the liver also occurs in the
cancerous cachexia, in anaemia and chlorosis of long standing, in
chronic suppurative diseases, etc.The dyscrasia of chronic alcoholism
is a very common cause of fatty liver.At the same time that
hyperplasia of the connective tissue is taking place the fat is
accumulating in the hepatic cells.So great is the accumulation of fat
in the blood that the serum presents a milky appearance.This excess in
the quantity of fat is rather due to diminished oxidation, to lessened
combustion, than to increased production.Another causative element of
the fat-production in cases of alcoholism is the interference of
alcohol with the process of digestion and assimilation.Poisoning by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other metals sets up an
acute fatty degeneration of the liver.Pregnancy, lactation, and
suppuration also have the same effect, but to a slighter and less
permanent extent.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Fatty liver agrees with amyloid liver in that
the fatty deposits increase the size and weight of the organ.The
surface is smooth, the peritoneal investment unaltered, and the margins
rounded.Sometimes the organ is merely increased in thickness,
sometimes in diameter.It has a greasy feel and cuts like a mass of
fatty tissue.Examined at a low temperature--below freezing--it seems
like a mass of suet, the proper structure being almost extinguished in
the fatty metamorphosis.The outline of the lobules remains distinct
even in cases far advanced in the fatty degeneration, but in the
extreme cases it is obliterated, the cut surface presenting a uniformly
yellowish or grayish-yellow tint.The fatty liver is also wanting in
blood; it is dry, and on section only the largest vessels contain any
blood.When cardiac disease of a kind to produce congestion of the
venous system exists--for example, mitral or tricuspid lesions--the
same relative decrease in the quantity of blood in the liver is
observable after death, although during the life of the subject the
opposite condition may have been present.The cause of this
bloodlessness of the fatty liver is to be sought in the pressure
exerted by the growing fat-cells.Not all cases of fatty liver are advanced to the degree indicated in
the above description.From the normal size up to the maximum attained
by the most advanced fatty liver there are numerous gradations in the
quantity of fat and in the dimensions of the organ.Fatty degeneration
may accompany cirrhosis, in which the liver is contracted.The deposits
of fat may take place in particular areas.In cases of fatty liver per
se the deposit occurs within the liver-cells, as may be demonstrated on
microscopic examination, the initial change consisting in the formation
of granules in the protoplasm which ultimately coalesce, thus producing
{1048} fat-globules or cells.The fatty change in the hepatic cells
proceeds in a certain methodical manner from the cells at the periphery
of each lobule to the centre.The quantity of fat deposited in the
liver in cases of fatty change is very great.In the normal condition
of the organ fat exists, according to Perls,[149] in the proportion of
3 per cent.When the condition of fatty
liver exists the quantity of fat rises to 40, even 45, per
cent.--almost one-half.It is important to note, as was pointed out by
Frerichs, that in an inverse ratio with the increase of fat was the
quantity of water.[Footnote 149: _Virchow's Archiv_, _supra_.]That more or less fatty change in the liver is not incompatible with a
normal functional activity is quite certain, but the boundary between
health and disease is by no means well defined in respect to the
quantity of fatty change in the liver-cells.The liver, within certain
limits, is a mere reservoir of the surplus fat of the body, and hence a
variable, but not excessive, amount of accumulation of fat is not
incompatible with a normal functional performance of the organ.The
limits of a merely functional state and of a diseased state are not,
therefore, very clearly defined.In certain inferior animals, as
Frerichs has shown, a fatty condition of the liver is normal.SYMPTOMS.--The signs and symptoms of fatty liver are by no means well
defined.This state of the organ, as a rule, accompanies the general
tendency to fatty metamorphosis and deposit in the body.It is a
symptom in the course of phthisis, of chronic alcoholism, and of
various forms of metallic poisoning, but under these circumstances
there is no material change in the course of the symptoms produced by
this complication.As an independent affection it rarely, if ever,
exists alone.So far as its symptoms can be defined, they are referable
to the organs of digestion and assimilation and to the liver itself.The appetite is generally good, but distress after eating, acidity and
heartburn, eructations of acid liquid and of certain articles of diet,
are experienced.The stools are usually rather soft or liquid, wanting
in color, whitish or pasty, and occasionally dark, almost black, owing
to the presence of blood.The
discharges are often offensive from the decomposition of certain
constituents of the food, acid and burning because of the presence of
acetic, butyric, and other fat acids, or merely offensive because of
the formation of hydrogen compounds with sulphur and phosphorus.Notwithstanding the derangement of the stomachal and intestinal
digestion, the deposition of fat continues in an abnormal ratio.With
the increase in body-weight a decline in muscular power takes place.The respiration is hurried on the slightest exertion, and dyspnoea is
produced by any prolonged muscular effort.The circulation is feeble
and the pulse slow in the state of repose, but on active exertion the
pulse becomes rapid and at the same time feeble.The sleep is disturbed
by horrifying dreams, and only on assuming a nearly sitting posture can
the patient sleep with any degree of quietude.In these cases of fatty liver a very considerable mental inquietude,
despondency, even hypochondria and melancholia, result.The relation of
insufficient hepatic excretion to the mental state is yet sub judice,
but there can be no doubt that some connection exists.From the
earliest {1049} period hepatic derangements--as the term hypochondria
denotes--have been associated with certain disorders of the mind.This
relation certainly holds good in respect to the mental perturbation
occurring in cases of fatty liver.With a rotund countenance and a
well-nourished body there is associated very considerable mental
despondency.Without distinct jaundice the skin has an earthen or tallow-like hue,
the conjunctiva is muddy or distinctly yellow, and now and then
well-defined jaundice appears.The urine is rather scanty, high- because of the presence of
bile-pigments, and deposits urates abundantly.When jaundice
accompanies fatty liver the urine will be very dark, muddy, thick, and
will react to the usual tests for bile, urates, etc.The area of hepatic dulness is, as a rule, enlarged in cases of fatty
liver.The deposition of fat in the cells adds to the gross size of the
organ, and hence the inferior margin extends below the border of the
ribs to a degree determined by the amount of increase in its substance.If the liver can be felt, it is smooth, not hard and resisting, and is
free from nodules.Usually, however, owing to deposits of fat in the
omentum and in the abdominal walls, the outlines and condition of the
liver cannot be ascertained, and must remain merely conjectural.Rather, therefore, by implication than by direct examination can the
condition of the liver be ascertained.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of fatty liver, as an
element in a general change not of a toxic character, is essentially of
a chronic character.The fatty liver of acute phosphorus, antimonial,
and other forms of poisoning is acute and fatal, but it is not these
forms with which we are here concerned.Acting the part of a reservoir
of the surplus fat stored up in the body, which may be disposed of
under normal and physiological conditions, the fatty liver becomes by
careful management a normal organ again.The course, duration, and
termination will therefore largely depend on the nature of the
management pursued.A fatty liver cannot, then, be regarded as fatal,
or even as dangerous to life per se.The course and termination will
therefore be those of the associated condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the existence of fatty liver will not
be difficult in all those cases in which this condition may properly be
suspected; for example, in phthisis, in chronic alcoholismus, in
obesity, and in cases of habitual indulgence in eating and drinking.If
in these cases the organ is distinctly enlarged, is smooth, and is
flabby in outline; if at the same time the digestion is deranged, the
stools are light in color, there are hemorrhoids, flatulence, acid
indigestion, and torpid bowels,--a fatty liver may be reasonably
suspected.The subjects of fatty liver are usually obese, and present
the characteristics typical of that condition, or they are the victims
of alcoholismus or present the evidence of habitual indulgence in the
pleasures of the table.The differentiation of fatty liver from amyloid
degeneration, from cystic disease, and from other maladies causing
enlargement of the organ is made by reference to these points in the
etiological history--by a careful study of the condition of the organ
itself and of the organs associated with it in function.As the amyloid
liver is more likely to be confounded with the fatty liver, it should
be noted that the former is an outgrowth of the process of suppuration,
that the organ {1050} is hard in texture, and that amyloid change
occurs at the same time in other organs--conditions opposed to those
characteristic of the fatty liver.Cancer of the liver is accompanied
by a peculiar cachexia; the body wastes, and the enlarged liver is hard
and nodular instead of being smooth and flabby.TREATMENT.--When fatty liver is a symptom merely, its treatment is
merged into that of the primary condition.Thus, in phthisis and in the
various forms of metallic and phosphorus-poisoning the condition of the
liver is quite secondary.There are cases of obesity, however, in which
the fatty change in the liver is a part of the general morbid process,
and must be treated accordingly.There are still other cases in which,
without a decided tendency to obesity, the food habitually consumed is
of a fatty or fat-forming nature.The first requisite in the treatment
of fatty liver is to amend the diet.From the time of Hippocrates down
to Mr.Banting it has been recognized that the starchy and saccharine
constituents of the food, as well as the fatty, contribute to the
formation of fat.In arranging a dietary in cases of fatty liver this
fact should be regarded.Besides excluding the fats, saccharine and
starchy substances should be cut off.The diet should be composed of
fresh animal foods, game, fish, oysters, and such succulent vegetables
as lettuce, celery, spinach, raw cabbage (cole-slaw), etc.Amongst the
articles excluded should be bread, but the greatest difficulty is
experienced in its withdrawal, many patients declaring themselves
unable to live without it.In such instances a small biscuit
(water-cracker) may be allowed, but, as far as may be accomplished,
bread should be cut off from the diet.If there are acidity, heartburn, pyrosis, and regurgitation of acid
liquid, much good may be expected from the administration of diluted
nitric acid before meals, especially if there be considerable uric acid
in the urine.The simultaneous administration of tincture of nux vomica
will prove useful if the appetite is poor and the digestion feeble.When the complexion is muddy, the conjunctivae yellow, and the tongue
coated, excellent results are had from the persistent use of phosphate
of sodium.Even better results may be had from a combination of the two agents, a
teaspoonful of the pulverized phosphate being given with one-fortieth
of a grain of the arseniate of sodium.Alkalies, as lithium citrate,
solution of potassa, etc., are unquestionably useful as remedies for
obesity and fatty liver, but they must be administered with a proper
caution.Also, the permanganate of potassium has seemed to the author
to be especially valuable as a remedy for these states.Remedies to increase the activity of the portal circulation and
diminish congestion of the hepatic vessels are useful at the outset,
but the anaemia which succeeds renders their use improper at a later
period.Amongst the hepatic stimulants of great use in those cases
characterized by whitish, pasty stools, yellow conjunctivae, etc., are
resin of podophyllin, euonymin, baptisin, and others having the same
powers.Saline laxatives are also useful, but to a less extent.It must
be remembered, however, that these subjects are wanting in bodily
vigor, often suffer from weak heart, and always have flabby muscles, so
that they bear all depleting measures badly.The hepatic stimulant of
greatest utility in these cases is sulphate of manganese.The writer
has had excellent results from a {1051} combination of quinine and
manganese.For the general state, which denotes insufficient oxidation
according to the chemical pathologists, permanganate of potassium is a
remedy of value, as above mentioned.The best form in which to
administer this is the compressed tablet, and the dose usually is two
grains.As chalybeate tonics are indicated, the oxidizing power of the
succinate of the ferric peroxide, the remedy so warmly advocated by
Buckler, may be utilized with advantage.The combination of quinine,
iron, and manganese in pill form, or the syrup of the iodides of iron
and manganese, or the phosphate of iron, quinine, and strychnine, are
tonics adapted to the relief of the depression accompanying this
malady.AFFECTIONS OF THE BILIARY PASSAGES.Catarrh of the Bile-Ducts.HISTORY AND DEFINITION.--Although catarrh of the bile-ducts had been
incidentally referred to by some previous writers, notably by Stokes of
Dublin, Virchow[150] was the first to treat of this condition
systematically.Amongst recent writers, Harley[151] appears to be the
only one disposed to question the importance of catarrh of the
bile-ducts as a factor in the production of jaundice.Even in
phosphorus-poisoning the appearance of jaundice, at one time supposed
to be haematogenic in source, has been referred to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.[152] It seems probable that opinions have too decidedly
veered toward the importance of this condition as a factor in the
production of jaundice.[Footnote 150: _Archiv fur path.117 _et seq._]

[Footnote 151: _Diseases of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 152: Wyss, _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1867, p.CAUSES.--Catarrh of the bile-ducts has been referred to all those
causes which can excite a catarrhal process in any situation.Amongst the systemic may be placed peculiarities of
constitution or idiosyncrasy.A tendency to hepatic disorders is a
feature in certain types of constitution, and, as such types are
transmitted, the hepatic disorders seem to be inherited.In such
persons, possessing the so-called bilious nature, catarrh of the
biliary passages is not uncommon, and a special susceptibility to it
apparently exists.The atmospherical and other causes which in some
subjects will set up a catarrh of the bronchi will in the bilious type
induce a catarrh of the duodenum and bile-ducts.The malady is not
inherited; only the character of bodily structure which favors it under
the necessary conditions.Climatic changes and certain seasons, especially the autumn, are
influential causes.Exposure to cold and dampness, the body warm and
perspiring, will set up a catarrhal process in the bile-ducts and
intestine, especially in those having the special susceptibility which
belongs to certain bodily types.Malarial miasm is an especially active
cause in malarial regions.The writer has seen many examples in various
parts of the United States within the malaria-breeding zone.Other
miasmatic agencies are not without importance.The exhalations from the
{1052} freshly-upturned soil of some cities, the gases from cesspools
and sewers, and illuminating gas exert a causative influence.The bad
air thus made up has been happily called civic malaria.The most influential causes of catarrh of the biliary passages are
local in origin and in action: they are the agencies which induce
catarrh of the duodenum.Disturbances of the portal circulation should
be first named.Whenever obstructive lesions of the cardiac orifices
exist, whenever the pulmonary circulation is impeded by disease of the
lungs, the portal vein is kept abnormally full, and as a necessary
result of the stasis a catarrh of the mucous membrane follows.Congestion of the portal system may be a result of vaso-motor paresis.The abdominal sympathetic may be the seat of various reflex
disturbances: those of a depressing kind induce stasis in the portal
system.Certain medicinal agents have this effect, and prolonged and
severe cutaneous irritation, it is probable, may act on the portal
circulation in the same way.The action of cold on the peripheral
nerves may be similarly explained.Catarrh by contiguity of tissue is the most frequent factor.Catarrh of
the duodenal mucous membrane is the initial condition, and from thence
the process extends to the bile-ducts.Although the duodenum may be
alone affected, the usual state of things is a gastro-intestinal
catarrh, the stomach and the whole length of the small intestine being
simultaneously diseased.When the catarrhal process is thus diffused
the duodenal mucous membrane is most deranged, probably because the
acid and fermenting chyme is first received here, and what acridity
soever it may possess attacks this part in its greatest strength.It
must be remembered that the secretion of the duodenal glands and of the
pancreas and liver must also have an abnormal character; hence those
foods which in the healthy condition of things are digested in this
part of the canal undergo ordinary putrefactive decomposition and
furnish very irritating products.This observation is especially true
of the fats: the fat acids are in the highest degree irritating.The
digestive fluid of the duodenum has a more or less pathological
character, because the catarrhal process not only interferes with the
habitually easy flow of the gland secretions, but, extending to the
gland elements themselves, gradually alter their structure.Gastro-intestinal catarrh results from the misuse of foods and the
abuse of certain condiments and of spirits.Excess in the quantity of
starchy, saccharine, and fatty foods which undergo conversion and
absorption in the intestine, habitually consumed, decomposition of such
portions as escape proper digestion ensues, and the products of this
decomposition exercise an irritant influence on the mucous membrane.The daily consumption of sauces and condiments and of highly-seasoned
foods has a constant irritating action; but more influential than any
other causative agency is the abuse of malt liquors and spirit.Whilst
the latter acts more on the stomach and the liver proper, the former
affect more the duodenal mucous membrane and the bile-ducts.To these causative agencies must be added a pathological state of the
bile itself.Under conditions not now known the bile seems to acquire
acrid properties and set up a catarrh in passing along the ducts.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The area affected by the catarrhal process
varies greatly.The termination of the common duct for a short space
may be the only part affected, but with this there is always more or
less, {1053} sometimes most extensive and severe, duodenal catarrh,
followed by jaundice.The extent to which the common duct is affected
may be exactly indicated by the staining with bile, which extends down
to the point of obstruction.The catarrhal process may invade the whole
extent of the common duct, the cystic duct, gall-bladder, and the
ramifications of the tube throughout the organ.The first change observable is a more or less considerable hyperaemia
of the mucous membrane; but this is rarely seen, because the
examination cannot be made at the time when this condition is present.The epithelial layer is swollen, sodden, the cells cloudy, undergoing
rapid multiplication and desquamating.The cast-off cylindrical
epithelium, mucous cells, and serum make up a turbid mixture, which,
with bile, fills the smaller ducts, and may in places, especially at
the orifice of the common duct, form an obstruction sufficient to
prevent the passage of the bile; which may, however, be readily pressed
out with a little force.Especially near the end of the common duct the
mucus is apt to accumulate, and a plug of it, often tenacious and
somewhat consistent, obstructs the orifice.It is probable that whilst
catarrh is the chief cause of jaundice, it may also, by a merely
intermittent activity, cause the condition of biliousness--now so far
relieved as to permit the bile to descend into the intestine, now so
much obstruction as to prevent the escape of any considerable part of
that formed.When the common duct is the seat of the catarrhal process,
and the outflow of bile thus prevented, it accumulates in the
gall-bladder, which may be so far distended as to present a
recognizable tumor of pyriform shape through the abdominal parietes.When the catarrhal process invades the finer ducts the appearances are
somewhat different.There are no bile-stains along the course of the
common and cystic ducts, and the gall-bladder is empty, or at most
contains only some mucus, with altered bile.The tubes at or near their
ultimate ramifications contain a turbid mucus composed of cylindrical
epithelium and lymphoid cells, and tenacious enough to close them
firmly.More or less hyperaemia of the liver-structures proper, and
consequent increased dimensions of the organ, a more or less active
catarrhal condition of the duodenal mucous membrane, accompany the
changes in the finer ducts.SYMPTOMS.--There are marked differences in the behavior of the more
acute cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts and the chronic examples of
the same disorder.The former is held to be the most frequent cause of
jaundice, whilst the latter is an important element in the so-called
bilious state, in lithaemia, and as a secondary condition in some
cardiac and pulmonary diseases.Also, the morbid complexus of catarrh
of the bile-ducts includes the symptoms of duodenal and gastro-duodenal
catarrh.The acute form of this disease sets in with the symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh.Usually, after indulgence in too highly
stimulating food or in some article having a specially irritating
character, an attack of acute indigestion supervenes.The tongue is
more or less heavily coated, the breath heavy, the taste bitter, pasty,
or sourish, the appetite poor or actual repugnance to food, especially
to the offending articles, is experienced, and nausea, not unfrequently
vomiting, ensues.The epigastrium and the hypochondriac regions have a
heavy, overloaded, distressed, {1054} and sore feeling; there is some
tenderness to pressure; sometimes the gall-bladder, abnormally full,
may be detected by careful palpation; and the area of hepatic dulness
will usually be increased.The abdomen is more or less distended by
gases, and eructations of offensive gases (hydrogen and sulphur
compounds, volatile fat acids, etc.)Constipation exists when
the catarrhal process is limited to the duodenum, and the stools
consist of hard lumps having a light yellow, clay-, or whitish
appearance.When the whole extent of the small intestine is affected,
the stools will be soft, liquid, or watery, and will vary in color from
yellow to gray or white.In some cases the fecal matters will have an
offensive odor--the odor of decomposition--and considerable discharges
of very foul-smelling gas will attend the evacuations.This symptom
will occur when the intestinal digestion is suspended and the contents
of the bowel in consequence undergo putrefactive decomposition.During the initial period of the disorder the urine will simply be
high- and loaded with urates and uric acid, but when jaundice
supervenes the pigment will convert the urine into a dark,
coffee-, and somewhat thick liquid.With the onset of the malady symptoms referable to the nervous system
appear.Headache, dizziness, and hebetude of mind are present, and now
and then an attack of catarrh of the bile-ducts will have the objective
signs of an ordinary migraine or sick headache.Usually, however, as
the intestinal and hepatic troubles develop, headache and some mental
hebetude come on, but when jaundice supervenes the headache becomes
more severe, and very considerable mental depression, irritability of
temper, and moroseness are experienced.Chilly sensations, with flashes
of heat, are felt at the outset, but with the appearance of jaundice
the sensation of coldness predominates.In some cases, the intestinal
catarrh being extensive, there will be, after some preliminary
chilliness, a febrile movement, but this is never of a pronounced
character, and in the slighter cases of the disease or when the
catarrhal process is limited to the bile-ducts, there is no elevation
of temperature.With the first symptoms the pulse is somewhat
quickened, but as the bile acids accumulate in the blood they effect a
decided slowing of the heart's action, the pulse falling as low, it may
be, as 50 per minute.This lessened activity of the circulation is
accompanied by corresponding reduction of temperature, the body-heat
falling a degree or more.The most distinctive symptom of catarrh of the bile-ducts is jaundice.In the acute or quickly-developing form above described of catarrhal
icterus the symptoms of gastro-intestinal disturbance precede the first
indication of jaundice from five to eight days.Yellowness of the
conjunctiva and of those parts of the body exposed to the air is the
first manifestation; afterward the jaundice hue becomes general.The
tint varies in depth from a faint gamboge-yellow, only discernible in a
favorable light, to a deep greenish- or brownish-yellow.In the more chronic cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts the symptoms are
simply those of a gastro-duodenal catarrh, to which some hepatic
disturbances are superadded.Some abdominal uneasiness felt in the
epigastrium and in the right hypochondrium, especially in two to three
hours after meals; flatulence, sometimes accompanied by colic; {1055}
constipation, persistent or alternating with diarrhoea--in the one case
in hard lumps with more or less mucus adherent, in the other soft or
liquid, and in both cases having a rather golden-yellow color, grayish
or black and tar-like appearance,--such are the symptoms referable to
the intestinal canal.The disturbances in the hepatic functions
produced by the catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane of the ducts
are further exhibited in a somewhat sallow, earthy, or muddy
complexion, yellowish tint of the conjunctiva, high-, acid urine
loaded with urates and phosphates.Such subjects, although having, it
may be, a keen appetite, rather lose than gain in weight: they
experience lassitude, headache, much depression of spirits, and the
mental symptoms are most pronounced during the time intestinal
digestion is going on.In fact, the morbid complexus is rather that of
intestinal catarrh; nevertheless, the slight degree of obstruction to
the outflow of bile occurring in these cases has an influence both in
the intestinal digestion and in the nutritive functions.Any degree of
obstruction, as has already been pointed out, leads to serious
structural change of the liver, and this in turn produces well-defined
symptoms.Disturbances of the hepatic functions, even jaundice, accompany the
paroxysms of malarial fever.Without the occurrence of fever, catarrhal
jaundice may come on during the course of chronic malarial poisoning.Catarrh of the bile-ducts is the pathogenetic factor in these cases.More especially in malarial regions, but also in temperate and warm
climates, paroxysmal attacks, with or without jaundice, are
comparatively frequent.These acute seizures occur in those having the
chronic form of the malady, and are excited by sudden climatic changes,
by excesses in eating, especially by the use of improper articles of
diet.Considerable nausea, flatulence, and constipation or diarrhoea,
weight, tension, and soreness in the right hypochondrium and sometimes
in the shoulder, chilliness, general malaise, headache, and an
increasing icterode tint of the skin, constitute the complexus of
symptoms belonging to these cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Acute catarrh of the bile-ducts
with jaundice has a well-defined course--in its mildest form, with
little gastric or gastro-intestinal disturbance--lasting ten days or
two weeks; in the ordinary form, with the accompanying gastro-duodenal
catarrh, running its course in a month to six weeks.In the chronic
form, with acute exacerbations due to indiscretions in diet or to
climatic influences, the course of the disease is chequered by
vicissitudes, the result of the causes just mentioned, and its duration
must therefore be indefinite and, as a rule, protracted.Catarrh of the
bile-ducts, or catarrhal jaundice, usually terminates in health after a
period of functional derangement of the intestines and liver.Without
exhibiting any features of a special character, some cases do not pass
through this benign course: the intestinal catarrh sets up an
ulcerative process at one or more points in the duodenum; but more
especially the obstruction to the free course of the bile caused by the
catarrhal swelling of the mucous lining of the ducts induces structural
changes in the liver--an hypertrophy of the connective-tissue elements,
a sclerosis.DIAGNOSIS.--There are but two signs which indicate the nature of the
disorder, and only one that is really distinctive.Intestinal
indigestion with slight coincident biliary derangement is one, and
jaundice is the {1056} other.When, after the signs and symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh have declared themselves, jaundice appears,
there can be no question as to the nature of the case.The diagnosis is
more difficult in the chronic cases with exacerbations due to the
exciting causes above mentioned, for the persistence of the jaundice
will suggest the occurrence of some permanent organic lesion.The
differentiation of the various kinds of jaundice has already been made.TREATMENT.--Regulation of the diet is of the first importance.Those
foods requiring the intestinal juices for their solution and
absorption, and which cannot be properly digested when a duodenal
catarrh exists or when bile is absent, should of course be excluded
from the diet.These articles are the fats, starches, and sweets.The
mucus playing the part of a ferment, these substances are converted
into various secondary products of an irritating character.Flatulence
is caused by the evolution of carbonic acid gas and the hydrogen
compounds of sulphur and phosphorus; and acetic, butyric, and other
acids not only change the reaction of the intestinal juices, but are
directly irritating to the mucous membrane.In the acute cases a diet
of skimmed milk, taken hot and at three hours' interval, and after the
acute symptoms have subsided, in conjunction with some other aliment,
is the most appropriate mode of alimentation.Meats, fish, eggs, and
oysters are the chief articles of diet, besides the milk, during the
whole course of the more chronic cases; and to these may be added the
succulent vegetables, as lettuce, spinach, celery, raw cabbage, and
tomatoes.If, in consequence of irritability of the mucous membrane or
of idiosyncrasy, any article occasions distress, it should be omitted
from the diet.The medicinal management includes the administration of remedies for
gastro-intestinal catarrh.The treatment of catarrhal jaundice has been
discussed.When constipation exists, saline laxatives, especially
phosphate of sodium and Rochelle salt, are useful.If there be
diarrhoea, the most appropriate remedies are bismuth, with or without
carbolic acid, Hope's mixture, oxides of zinc and silver, and other
mineral tonic astringents.The propriety of the administration of special hepatic
stimulants--cholagogues--has been much disputed.When the disorder
consists merely in an obstruction to the outflow of bile, the utility
of stimulating the production of this secretion seems more than
doubtful.Much harm has been done by the indiscriminate use of mercury.Its power to increase the production of bile having been assumed, and
the quantity of bile present in the feces being manifestly less in
cases of catarrhal jaundice, it followed that mercury should be
employed in this disorder.Modern experience has quite demonstrated its
inutility in the mode and for the purpose to which it was formerly
devoted.Nevertheless, good effects are had from calomel in small doses
as a sedative to the mucous membrane.When there are nausea, headache,
vertigo, and constipation present, excellent results may be had from
the 1/20 gr.of calomel, exhibited at short intervals until
the bowels are moved.If calomel possessed the property formerly
ascribed to it, of stimulating the hepatic functions, it would be
contraindicated in catarrh of the bile-ducts.This contraindication
exists in respect to all hepatic stimulants.If there be decided irritability of the stomach and constipation,
{1057} Seidlitz powders may be given at regular intervals.Phosphate of
sodium in drachm doses is highly useful for the double purpose of a
laxative effect and to prevent the tendency to inspissation of the
bile, which is one of the most important results of catarrh of the
bile-ducts and gall-bladder.In the more chronic cases the persistent
use of sodium phosphate is to be highly commended.In this disease, especially as it occurs in gouty subjects, sulphate of
manganese is often decidedly serviceable.If anaemia and debility
coexist, this remedy can be combined with sulphate of iron and sulphate
of quinine--a combination which the writer has found peculiarly
effective under such circumstances.When oxidation is deficient and the
urates are present in the urine in excessive quantity, good effects are
had from the permanganate of potassium, a tablet containing two grains
being given four times a day.In the more chronic cases the salts of
silver, copper, and zinc are really very useful, especially the oxides
of silver and zinc; and of these the former is more efficient.Better
than any of those mentioned is arsenic, as arseniate of sodium or as
Fowler's solution, but the best results are had from small or medium
doses persistently used.If there be much intestinal catarrh and
consequent diarrhoea, bismuth and aromatic powder, oxide of silver,
Fowler's solution with a little opium, Hope's mixture, etc.It is in catarrh of the bile-ducts that nitric and nitro-muriatic acids
have proved useful, rather than in cirrhosis and other diseases of the
liver-tissues.They prevent fermentation, promote oxidation, and
increase the activity of the assimilative functions.When there occurs
active fermentation of certain foods, and consequently considerable
flatulence, excellent results are obtained from the members of the
antiseptic group--from creasote or carbolic acid, salicylic acid,
biborate of sodium, the benzoates, etc.To these may be added quinine,
the dose of which will be determined by the purpose for which it is
prescribed.So often is catarrhal jaundice of malarial origin that
quinine becomes a remedy of high importance in the cases occurring in
the malarial-forming zone.Certain special plans of treatment have been proposed for the cure of
catarrhal jaundice.One of the most effective of these is enemata of
cold water.By means of an irrigating apparatus the large intestine is
well distended with water once a day for several days.The first enema
has a temperature of 60 degrees F., and subsequent injections are a
little warmer.The increased peristalsis of the bowels and the reflex
contractions of the gall-bladder dislodge the mucus lining and
obstructing the gall-ducts.When the bile flows into the intestine,
digestion is resumed and the catarrhal inflammation subsides.But with
the irrigation method may be employed other remedies, as above
indicated.Faradization of the gall-bladder has been used successfully for the
expulsion of the stored-up bile and the removal of the mucus
obstructing the ducts.It is applied by means of one moistened sponge
electrode placed directly over the gall-bladder, and the other on the
opposite side of the body and posteriorly.A slowly-interrupted faradic
current is then passed.This expedient is not suitable when the case is
acute in character.{1058} Biliary Concretions; Gall-Stones; Hepatic Calculi; Hepatic
Colic.DEFINITION.--There are two classes of concretions which may occasion
symptoms: inspissated bile and regularly-formed gall-stones.Slowly-developing symptoms of jaundice from obstruction may arise from
the deposit of particles of inspissated bile in the hepatic ducts, or
sudden attacks of hepatic colic be due to the passage of concretions.When biliary calculi reach the intestines, certain kinds of disturbance
may be caused by their presence there.Under the term biliary
concretions must be considered, therefore, the mechanism of their
production, their composition, the symptoms caused by their passage
through the ducts (hepatic colic), and the intestinal disturbance due
to their retention in the bowel.Formation: Inspissated Bile.--Those concretions consisting of
inspissated bile are irregularly-shaped masses of a brownish,
greenish-brown, or reddish-brown color, friable and crumbling into a
gritty dust with slight pressure of the fingers.When recent and before
drying, they are softer, almost pultaceous, and may take the form of
the canal through which pressed.But as seen after drying they present
the appearance of a dark vegetable extract, dried and partly
pulverized.When examined as found in the gall-bladder or lodged in the
larger hepatic ducts or distributed in irregular fragments (gall-sand)
in the various hepatic passages, they present the shape, color, and
general characteristics of a partly-dried vegetable extract roughly
broken up, but still soft enough to take any shape from pressure.The
writer has seen them thus in situ accompanying regularly-formed
gall-stones in a case of gunshot wound of the liver.These masses of
inspissated bile differ from gall-stones in composition; they consist
of bile, but with a preponderance of the coloring matter.According to
Harley,[153] who has given a more correct account of these bodies than
any other systematic writer, their composition is as follows:

  Water    5.4
  Solids  94.6

The contents of the solids are--

  Bile-pigment                84.2
  Cholesterin                  0.6
  Salts (iron, potash, soda)  15.2

[Footnote 153: _The Diseases of the Liver, with and without Jaundice,
etc._, by George Harley, M.D., F.R.S., Philada., 1883, p.Some years ago, before I was aware of the nature of such concretions.I
detected a number in examining the stools of a patient who had in quick
succession many attacks of hepatic colic, but as the usual form of
concretion was looked for and not found, the relation of these bodies
to the symptoms in the case was not understood.I now recognize the
value of Harley's observations on these bodies.The biliary concretion which is properly a gall-stone has a definite
form and a more or less well-defined crystalline structure.The most usual form is octagonal or hexagonal or
polyangular, with smooth facets, corresponding to points of contact of
other calculi.Instead of smooth facets and sharp angles, the
concretion may be studded with irregularly-shaped masses.When there
are numerous {1059} calculi present, they have smooth surfaces and
rather sharp angles, made, not by attrition, as has been supposed, but
by deposition of the new material under pressure.When they have this
form there are many present, but the number of facets does not indicate
the number of calculi, and the absence of facets is not proof of the
absence of other calculi.The smooth opposing surfaces are not always
plane, but may be convex or concave to fit the shape of the adjacent
bodies.Calculi may be globular, ovoid, cylindrical, and truncated cones.The
largest in my collection is egg-shaped, and nearly filled the
gall-bladder which contained it, a little mucus free from bile-elements
only being present.If a concretion forms in a duct or a single one is
present in the gall-bladder, the shape is determined by the pressure of
the walls of the duct or of the gall-bladder, respectively.As found in
the stools, and still somewhat soft, the shape will represent the form
of the common duct through which it has been pressed.Such a soft,
recently-formed gall-stone will have the crystalline structure and
chemical constitution of these bodies, and will therefore differ from,
apparently, similar masses of inspissated bile.Although a round,
ovoid, or cylindrical calculus indicates the absence of others because
there are no evidences of mutual pressure and adaptation, a positive
conclusion cannot be reached in that way, for the gall-bladder may
contain numerous calculi of long-standing, and a recent concretion
formed in a duct be discharged with the usual symptoms.The number of calculi which may be present at any time or be produced
in the course of years ranges from one to several thousand.The number
is in inverse ratio to the size.One case[154] is reported in which
7802 calculi were found in the gall-bladder, but they must have been
very minute in size.Of the specimens now in my collection, there are
230 obtained from one gall-bladder, which they entirely filled; they
are nearly uniform in size, have an average weight of two grains, and
contain four, five, and six smooth facets.Another collection of
calculi removed from a closed gall-bladder contains 45, of large size,
distending the organ and forming a tumor which projected beyond the
margin of the liver.Hepatic calculi are rarely solitary; hence if one
attack of hepatic colic occur, others may be expected.[Footnote 154: Frerichs, _op.In color gall-stones vary from a clear white to a dark-brown, almost
black, tint.The most usual tint of the mature calculi in the
gall-bladder is that of the ripe chestnut.Long stay in the intestines
increases the depth of the color, until it becomes almost black; on the
other hand, detention in the gall-bladder has a slightly bleaching
action; but the real cause of difference of color is the presence or
absence of pigment.If composed of pure cholesterin, the color will be
whitish, opaque, or glistening and almost translucent.In size gall-stones vary from the smallest pea up to a hen's egg.When
several hundreds are contained in the gall-bladder, they will usually
be of the dimension of a medium-sized pea.Two large solitary
concretions in my possession are respectively 2 inches and 1-1/2 inches
in long diameter, and 1 inch and 3/4 of an inch transversely.Very much
larger calculi have, however, been recorded; thus, one mentioned by
Frerichs is 5 inches in length and 4 inches in circumference.The most
frequently {1060} encountered calculus, at least in this country, is
polyangular in shape and of the size of a large pea.Globular or ovoid
seems to be the prevailing form, and the dimensions that of a small
pea, in Germany, according to Frerichs and Von Schuppel, but this
statement must refer to the initial shape of these bodies.Not all hepatic calculi have defined mathematical forms, but may
consist of branching cylinders composed of irregular nodular masses,
not unlike the concretions of inspissated bile.As a rule, in each case
where the calculi are multiple there is uniformity of color, shape, and
composition.The
calculi obtained from each subject are in one case white, polyangular,
rather unctuous, and nearly equal in size; in another, chestnut-brown
in color, polyangular in shape, and varying slightly in size, but
uniformly characteristic in shape; and in a third, singular in number,
ovoid in shape, dark-brown in color.When fresh they contain
considerable water, and at all times are hygroscopic.Dried in the air,
they are composed of--

  Water    4
  Solids  96
         ---
         100

The solids consist of--

  Cholesterin                  98
  Pigment                       1
  Inorganic or mineral matter   1
                              ---
                              100

Such are the constituents, according to Harley, of the usual
concretion, the cholesterin calculus.But as other varieties are
encountered occasionally, it may be well to give the composition of
these.The following table by Ritter, to be found in _Robin's Journal_
for 1872 (p.60), is a correct representation of the contents of
different specimens:

---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----

The above may be regarded as the average composition, expressed in
round numbers.The variations from these figures will be comprehended
in two parts.A calculus consists of three several parts: the nucleus, the body, the
rind.A calculus of small or medium size may be a nucleus for the
formation of a large one.Usually the nucleus consists of a bit of
mucus, casts of the biliary ducts (Thudicum), inspissated bile, a
blood-clot, a liver-fluke or other parasite, as a desiccated
round-worm, or some foreign body, as a seed, or, as in one reported
example, a globule of mercury.[155] {1061} The central mass of mucus
may contain a large proportion of pigment or crystals of cholesterin or
lime-salts, giving it special characteristics.[156] There may be
several nuclei.Fauconneau-Dufresne reports an instance in which a
pyramidal concretion contained four, and Guilbert a globular stone with
five, distinct nuclei.Such examples of calculi having multiple nuclei
are produced by the adhesion whilst in a soft state of two or more, and
the subsequent addition of material to the conjoint mass, welding it
into a single stone.A few calculi are homogeneous throughout, composed
of nearly pure cholesterin, mixed intimately with a little coloring
matter and lime salts.The cholesterin calculus will have a somewhat
translucent appearance, will be a dead white or a yellowish-white, or
present a greenish- or brownish-yellow tint through the white.Even the
white calculus, apparently composed of nearly pure cholesterin, will be
found on section to contain traces of a nucleus.By long detention in a
gall-bladder whose duct is permanently occluded, and is therefore free
of fluid, the mucus nucleus may so shrivel as to leave a cavity which
is merely stained.One of my specimens--a solitary calculus of large
size--exhibits this peculiarity.[Footnote 155: Thudicum, J. L., _On Gall-stones_, London, 1863; also
Frerichs, _op.[Footnote 156: Cyr, Jules, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_,
Paris, 1884, p.11 _et seq._]

The body consists of cholesterin, nacreous or darkened by pigment,
deposited in radiating lines or in concentric layers, or in both
together.Pigment may be intimately incorporated with the cholesterin
or deposited between the layers of this substance, pure or nearly pure,
forming an alternating arrangement.The crust or rind usually is smooth, unctuous to the touch, firm, but
when broken with the finger-nail readily crumbles.When composed of
lime salts, or when the cholesterin is mixed with varying proportions
of these salts and of pigment, the surface is still smooth, but
thicker, firmer, and darker in color.The rind may not be smooth, but
studded with wart-like projections, or it may consist of several layers
of earthy matter separated by pigment.These layers may be very
friable, and readily crumble and fall off.In some instances the crust,
several lines in thickness, is the body of the calculus, and the cavity
contains only a light honeycomb of mucus and pigment.The specific gravity of gall-stones composed of crystallized
cholesterin is nearly that of water.Air-dried calculi will float on
water, but the recent ones, full of moisture, sink.The relation of the
weight of the calculus to that of the bile is more important.As the
specific gravity of bile ranges from 1020 to 1026, it is obvious that
on this fluid air-dried calculi will float, but, holding in the recent
state much water, ordinary gall-stones will sink.Those containing much
mineral matter will have a correspondingly high specific gravity--much
higher than bile.ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF HEPATIC CALCULI.--Certain conditions are
necessary to the formation of these bodies on the part of the bile and
on the part of the gall-bladder and ducts.Constituted for the most
part of cholesterin, which exists in such small quantity in normal
bile, there must be some change in the composition of this fluid to
increase the quantity or to diminish the solubility of that
constituent.It will conduce to a better understanding of the subject
to premise the composition of the bile: {1062}

  Bile contains, in 1000 parts,
    Water            860
    Solids           140

reaction become acid from any cause, the constituent cholesterin is
precipitated; and this occurs the more readily the larger the
proportion of this substance held in solution.Cholesterin is an
excrementitious material found in the blood and excreted by the liver.It represents in part, probably, the waste of nervous matter, but more
certainly of the fatty tissues in general.Conditions of the system in
which the metamorphosis of the fatty elements occurs more freely--as
obesity, advancing life, etc.--are accompanied by an increased
production and excretion of cholesterin.So long as the neutral state or the alkalinity of the bile is
maintained, the cholesterin will be kept in solution, although its
relative proportion may be in excess of the normal.A lack of the soda
constituent of the system is one factor, but the most important is a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane of the bile-ducts and
gall-bladder.The mucus formed plays a double role: it furnishes a
nucleus about which cholesterin crystallizes; it acts as a ferment and
inaugurates a process of acid fermentation which results in the
precipitation of cholesterin.When all the conditions favorable to the
separation and crystallization of cholesterin are present, any foreign
body may serve the purpose of a nucleus.The articles which have thus
served have been enumerated.A by no means infrequent combination is that of bilirubin with calcium;
and this may constitute the nucleus or form a part of the body or the
crust of a calculus.The mechanism of its formation is not unlike that
of the cholesterin concretion.Bilirubin is soluble in alkalies, and is
precipitated from its solution by acids.It follows that when acid
fermentation takes places under the influence of mucus, bilirubin may
be precipitated in combination with calcium.The salts of sodium and
potassium are much more abundant in bile than those of lime, but the
latter much more often enter into the formation of calculi because of
their slighter solubility.Other combinations of bile-pigments, mucus,
and the salts of the bile take place, but they are relatively less
frequent.The principal lime salt is the carbonate, and this combines
in varying proportions with the bile acids, the fat acids, and
bile-pigment.Certain physical conditions are not less important than the chemical in
the production of hepatic calculi.Accumulation of bile in the
gall-bladder, stasis, and concentration are essential conditions.If
bile remains long in the gall-bladder, it becomes darker in color and
more viscid, its specific gravity rises, and the relative proportion of
solids increases, doubtless because of the absorption of a part of the
water.The reaction--which, as has been stated, is in the fresh state
neutral or {1063} alkaline--becomes acid in consequence of a
fermentative change (Von Gorup-Besanez) set up by the mucus.If a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane exist, the mucus, epithelium,
and lymphoid cells cast off play the part of a ferment.The lime which
is so important a constituent of biliary concretions is not present
even in concentrated bile in sufficient amount to account for its
agency in the formation of these bodies, is furnished by the diseased
mucous membrane (Frerichs).Indeed, numerous crystals of carbonate of
lime have been seen in situ in contact with the mucous membrane in
cases of chronic catarrh.It follows, then, that catarrh of the biliary
passages has an important causative relation to that pathological
condition of the bile which precedes the formation of calculi.In this
connection we must not lose sight of the researches made by Ord[157] on
the action exerted by colloids on the formation of concretions.The
mucus is the colloid; cholesterin, lime, and soda salts are the
crystalloids.These latter diffusing through the colloid medium, the
resulting combinations assume spheroidal forms.The union of bilirubin
and lime salts illustrates the same principle.[Footnote 157: _On the Influence of Colloids upon Crystalline Forms and
Cohesion, with Observations on the Structure and Mode of Formation of
Urinary and other Calculi_, by W. Miller Ord, M.D., F.R.C.P.Lond.,
etc., London, 1879.]CAUSES.--We have here to consider the external conditions and the
general somatic influences which lead to the formation of biliary
concretions.Besides other
agencies due to advancing life, the increase of cholesterin is an
influential factor.The less active state of the functions in general,
diminished oxidation, loss of water, and concentration of the bile are
influential factors in determining the formation of hepatic calculi in
advancing life, as the opposite conditions oppose their production in
early life.Although not unknown in infancy, at this period in life and
until twenty years of age they occur but rarely.Fauconneau-Dufresne,[158] of 91 cases, had 4 in infants; Wolff[159] had
1 in a collection of 45 cases; and Cyr,[160] 2 cases under ten in a
group of 558 cases.The following table illustrates the influence of
age on the productivity of gall-stones:

p.[Footnote 160: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, Paris, 1884,
p.Although there is a general correspondence in the results of the
observations on the age most liable, there are differences.Thus, Cyr,
whose figures represent the experiences at Vichy, makes the age of
maximum liability from twenty to forty years--distinctly earlier than
any other observer; and hence it is necessary to bear in mind the
extreme latitude of his diagnosis.Of my own collection, 30 in number,
all doubtful cases {1064} excluded, there were 20 between thirty and
fifty years, and 10 between fifty and seventy.Of these, 22 occurred in
subjects between forty and sixty.The period of maximum liability is
about fifty years of age.Cyr refers the difference of his statistics
from those of other observers to the character of the patients.The
preponderance in the number of cases of hepatic calculi at or about the
fiftieth year is referable to the lessened activity of the nutritive
functions at this period, and to the increase in the relative
proportion of cholesterin in the blood in advanced life (Luton[161]).Charcot[162] maintains that after sixty biliary calculi are more
frequent, but owing to the physiological conditions then existing the
migration of these bodies is effected without notable inconvenience.[Footnote 161: Jaccoud's _Dictionnaire encycloped._, art."Voies
Biliaires;" _idem._, _Bull.de Therap._, March 15, 1866.][Footnote 162: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.According to most authorities, females are more liable to the formation
of gall-stones than are men.Thudicum, after an analysis of the
statistics given by the most experienced and celebrated authorities,
places the proportion at 3 to 2.Von Schuppel gives the same figures.Cyr, whilst recognizing this estimate as true of the great mass of
observations on this point, finds that in his own cases the
preponderance of females over males was even greater, being 4 to
1--inversely to the liability of the sexes to gout; but this excess is
to be explained by the character of the subjects falling under his
observation.Women are subjected to influences which favor the
formation of these concretions, such as pregnancy, sedentary habits,
diet of a restricted character, the use of corsets, and the somatic
changes at the climacteric period.The social state, by reason of the conditions associated with a good
position in life, has an influence in the production of calculi.Luxurious habits and indulgence in the pleasures of the table are
important factors, and hence this malady is encountered amongst the
better class of patients in private practice rather than amongst
laboring people in the hospitals.As the somatic conditions which exert a predisposing action, and the
social circumstances also favoring the formation of hepatic calculi,
are transmitted, heredity is by some classed among the etiological
factors, but it can only be regarded as indirect.Malarial influences unquestionably exert a very powerful influence as
this malady occurs in this country.Paroxysms of intermittent either
induce or accompany the seizures of hepatic colic, and chronic malarial
poisoning exerts a direct causative influence through the hepatic
disturbances and the gastro-duodenal catarrh which are associated with
it.Attacks of hepatic colic are extremely frequent in the malarial
regions of the West and South.It may be, however, that this malady is
frequent rather in consequence of the diet of pork than of climatic
causes, for it is probable that indulgence in such food plays an
important part in the formation of biliary concretions (Harley).Due
allowance made for diet, climate is yet, no doubt, an influential
factor.In warm, especially in malarial, regions the functions of the
liver are taxed to compensate for the increased action of the skin and
lungs; but this organ is, besides, affected by the poison of malaria,
and to the congestion caused by it is superadded a catarrhal state of
the bile-ducts and of the duodenum.A {1065} pathological condition of
the bile itself is first induced; then the fermentative changes set up
by the mucus cause the separation and crystallization of pigment and
cholesterin.Certain seasons favor the formation of biliary concretions, because
then the special influences which operate at all times are more active
and persistent.These seasons are fall, winter, and early spring, and
gall-stones are more numerous then in consequence of the activity of
the malarial poison, the character of the diet then employed, and the
lessened oxidation due to the more sedentary life.Climate is a factor
of some consequence, but not in the direction that might have been
supposed.Gall-stones are more common in temperate than in tropical
climates--a statement confirmed by the observation of the physicians of
India.They are, according to Harley, quite common in Russia, where
also they attain to extraordinary dimensions; but these circumstances
are not due to the climatic peculiarities of that country, so much as
to the diet habitually consumed, consisting so largely of fatty
substances.Of all the conditions which favor the production of gall-stones, none
are so influential as the bodily state and the associated dietetic
peculiarities.Those troubled with these concretions, as they have
occurred under my observation, have been either obese or have had a
manifest tendency in that direction.They have had a strong inclination
for the fat-forming foods, also for starchy, saccharine, and fatty
articles, such as bread and butter, potatoes, beans and peas, pork,
bacon, and fat poultry, etc.Harley thinks indulgence in bacon (p.Thudicum rejects this notion on chemical grounds,
for obesity and the free consumption of fat cannot be concerned in the
production of these bodies, because cholesterin is an alcohol.[163] The
agency of a fatty diet has been so strongly indicated in clinical
observations, and the relation of cholesterin to the fats so obvious,
that it can hardly be doubted the free consumption of fat in food
contributes directly to the formation of calculi.A catarrhal state of the duodenal mucous membrane
existing, and the bile excluded by swelling and obstruction of the
bile-ducts, fats are decomposed, and the fat acids, absorbed into the
portal blood, contribute to those chemical changes in the bile which
result in the precipitation of cholesterin.Beneke[164] traces a
connection between atheromatous degeneration of the vessels and the
formation of biliary concretions.A general increase in the amount of
fat in the body is usually coincident with the atheromatous change, and
at the same time the relative proportion of cholesterin in the bile
becomes greater.[Footnote 163: _A Treatise on Gall-stones_, p.Indulgence in the starchy and saccharine foods plays a part in the
formation of gall-stones not less, if not more, important than the
consumption of fats.A diet of such materials is highly fattening, and
if the necessary local conditions exist they readily undergo
fermentation, and thus cause or keep up a catarrh of the mucous
membrane.Too long intervals between meals, Frerichs[165] thinks, is more
influential than errors of diet in causing concretions.The bile
accumulates in the gall-bladder, and the condition of repose favors the
occurrence of those changes which induce the separation and
crystallization of cholesterin.{1066} Obstacles to outflow of every
kind have the same effect.The largest calculus in my possession was
obtained from a case of cancer of the gall-bladder which compressed,
and finally closed, the cystic duct.Sedentary habits have the same
mechanical effect, but, as already pointed out, insufficient air and
exercise act by lessening oxidation.Corpulent persons indulging in
rich food and avoiding all physical exertion, those of such habits
confined to bed by illness or injury, the literary, the well-to-do,
self-indulgent, lazy, are usual subjects of this malady.Any condition
of things which causes a considerable retardation in the outflow of
bile will have a pathogenetic importance, especially if the causes of
chemical change, the lessened quantity of taurocholic and glycocholic
acid, and an increased quantity of cholesterin, coexist.Moral causes,
as fear, anxiety, chagrin, anger, etc., have seemed to exercise a
causative influence in some instances (Cyr).[Footnote 165: _A Clinical Treatise on Disease of the Liver_, Syd.To the causes of retardation of the bile-flow mentioned above must be
added catarrh of the bile-ducts.This acts in a twofold way--as an
obstruction; a plug of mucus forming the nucleus.It has already been
shown that fermentative changes may be set up by the mucus, which plays
the part of a ferment, an acid state of the bile resulting.Situation of Gall-stones, and their Destiny.--The gall-bladder is, of
course, the chief site for these bodies, but biliary concretions and
masses of inspissated bile may be found at any point in the course of
the ducts.Single stones may be impacted at any point in the cystic,
hepatic, or common duct, or masses composed of numerous small calculi
may take the form of a duct and branches, making a branching calculus
of the shape and size of the mould in which it is cast.Such casts may
be hollow, thus permitting an outlet to the bile, or they may
completely close the tube, and a cyst form, the walls of which grow
thicker with connective-tissue deposits.Stones of very large size may
be thus enclosed, Frerichs having seen one the size of a hen's egg
formed about a plum-seed, which was the nucleus.In some rare instances
the major part of the larger tubes have been filled with inspissated
bile, through which the fluid bile could only be slowly filtered.Calculi are not often found in the hepatic duct, since they can only
lodge there in descending from the smaller tubes, and hence are too
small to become wedged in.The usual site, as has been sufficiently
explained, is the gall-bladder.At the entrance to the cystic duct and
at the terminus of the common duct in the duodenum are the points where
migrating calculi are most apt to be arrested.Spontaneous disintegration of gall-stones sometimes occurs.Cholesterin
being dissolved off of the corners and edges, the cohesion of the mass
is impaired and it falls apart in several fragments.By very slight
mechanical injury air-dried calculi will be broken up.In the
gall-bladder two factors are in operation to effect the disintegration
of the contained calculi: the movements of the body, by which the
corners and the borders are crumbled; the solvent action of the
alkaline bile on the cholesterin.When, however, these concretions are
made up of lime and pigment, their integrity can be impaired only by
the process of cleavage; no solvent action can take place.Various changes occur in the ducts or in the gall-bladder in
consequence of the presence of these concretions.Whilst a catarrhal
state of the mucous {1067} membrane of the ducts is an element of much
importance in the process by which concretions are formed, on the other
hand the presence of these bodies excites catarrh, ulceration,
perforation, and, it may be, abscess of the liver.When concretions
form or are deposited in the ducts, they cause inflammatory reaction,
the walls yield, and the neighboring hepatic structures may also be
affected by contiguity.The dilatation of the tube is usually
cylindrical, much more rarely sacciform.The neighboring connective
tissue may undergo hyperplasia and a more or less extensive sclerosis
occur.More frequently the calculus ulcerates through, and an abscess
is produced which will take the usual course of that malady.Very
rarely a calculus is found enclosed in a separate sac and surrounded by
healthy hepatic tissue (Roller).[166]

[Footnote 166: _Berliner klin.42, 1879; _ibid._, Nos.16, 17, and 19 for 1877, Fargstein.]As the gall-bladder is the usual place for the formation and storage of
gall-stones, the changes in connection with this organ are the most
important.The calculi may be so numerous or so large as to distend the
gall-bladder and cause it to project from under the inferior border of
the liver, so as to be felt by palpation of the abdominal wall.The
stones may be few in number and float in healthy bile, or they may fill
the bladder to the exclusion of fluid, the cystic duct being closed
permanently; or there may be, with one or more concretions, a fluid
composed of mucus, muco-pus, serum, and bilious matter.The mucous
membrane may be in a normal state, but this is rare; usually it is
affected by the catarrhal process, and atrophic degeneration has taken
place to a less or greater extent; the rugae are obliterated, the
muscular layer hypertrophied.When attacks of hepatic colic have
occurred, more or less inflammation of the peritoneal layer of the
gall-bladder and cystic duct is lighted up, and organized exudations
form, changing the shape and position of the organs concerned.It is
usual in old cases of hepatic colic to find the gall-bladder bound down
by strong adhesions, the cavity much contracted or even obliterated,
the cystic duct closed, and the neighboring portion of the liver the
seat of sclerosis.Such inflammatory exudations about the gall-bladder
may become the seat of malignant disease--of scirrhus.Several examples
of this have been reported, and one has occurred in my own practice.The contact of a gall-stone, especially of a polyangular stone, may
cause ulceration of the mucous membrane.This is the more apt to occur
if the muscular layer of the gall-bladder is hypertrophied, especially
if certain fasciculi are thickened and overacting, leaving intervening
parts weak and yielding to the pressure of the stone forced in by the
spasmodically contracting muscles.Finally yielding, the stone and
other contents of the gall-bladder escape into the cavity of the
abdomen.Adhesions to neighboring parts may prevent rupture.Such
adhesions are contracted with the colon, the duodenum, the stomach, and
other organs.In some rare instances the closed gall-bladder has
undergone a gradual process of calcification, the mucous membrane
losing its proper structure, the muscular layer degenerating, and a
slow deposit of lime salts taking place, the ultimate result being that
the biliary concretions are enclosed in a permanent shell.As above indicated, biliary concretions may remain where deposited for
an indefinite period.Very often they migrate from the point of
formation, the gall-bladder, into the duodenum, producing
characteristic {1068} symptoms called hepatic colic.As the size of the
ducts increases from above downward, obviously but little vis a tergo
is needed to propel the concretions onward.The chief agency in the
migration of these bodies is the discharge of bile.Common observation
shows that the symptoms of hepatic colic usually declare themselves in
two or three hours after a meal--at that time when the presence of the
chyme in the duodenum solicits the flow of bile.The gall-bladder
contracts on its contents with an energy in direct ratio to the amount
of bile present, and with the gush of fluid the concretion is whirled
into the duct.Once there, the cystic duct being unprovided with
muscular fibres, the onward progress of the stone must depend on the
flow of bile; and, as the canal is devious, this may not always carry
the concretion into the common duct.Just behind the neck of the
gall-bladder the duct makes an angle somewhat abrupt, and here also its
folds project into the canal, so that at this point the stone is apt to
lodge; but much depends on the size and shape of the calculus.If it
pass through the cystic duct, the inflammation resulting may close the
canal, several instances of which have fallen under my observation.The
next point where stoppage of the migrating calculus may, and frequently
does, occur is the orifice of the common duct in the duodenum.This
orifice has a funnel shape, the smaller extremity toward the intestine,
the object of this being to prevent the entrance into the duct of
foreign bodies from the intestine.A diverticulum is thereby made
(Vater's) in which a concretion may lodge, partly or wholly preventing
the escape of bile into the bowel.The various forces concerned in the
propulsion of the concretion onward from the common duct into the
intestine are the discharges of bile, the contraction of the few
muscular fibres in the walls of the duct, the respiratory movements,
especially forced expiration, coughing, sneezing, vomiting,
defecation--in fact, all of those acts in which the abdominal muscles,
the diaphragm, and the sphincters are simultaneously brought into
strong contraction.The symptoms produced by the migration and stoppage
of a concretion will vary according to the size and shape of the stone,
and the consequent diminution in the amount of bile discharged or its
complete arrest.In other words, the stone may be firmly wedged in,
completely closing the canal against the passage of bile, or it may lie
loosely in the diverticulum Vateri, acting as a sort of ball valve, now
permitting a gush of bile, and now stopping the passage-way more or
less tightly.The migration of calculi may take place by ulcerating through into
neighboring hollow organs.Usually the first step consists in stoppage
of the bile.To the accumulating bile mucus is added, and the
gall-bladder or the duct--usually the common or cystic duct--dilates,
often to a considerable extent, and, adhesions forming, discharge
ultimately takes place through some neighboring hollow organ.The
routes pursued by such fistulous communications are various.The organs
most frequently penetrated are the stomach, duodenum, and colon, less
often the urinary passages, and very rarely the portal vein.Numerous
examples of external discharge of calculi have been reported.The most
usual, as it is the most direct, is the fistulous connection of the
gall-bladder or common duct with the duodenum.Solitary stones of
immense size have been thus discharged.Murchison[167] gives references
to many interesting {1069} examples, and the various volumes of
_Transactions of the Pathological Society_ are rich in illustrative
cases.The symptoms produced by the migration of calculi by the natural
route and by ulceration into other organs will be hereafter considered.[Footnote 167: _Clinical Lectures on the Diseases of the Liver_, 2d
ed., p.487 _et seq._]

SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF GALL-STONES AT THEIR ORIGINAL
SITE.--Very large calculi or numerous small ones may be present in the
biliary passages without causing any recognizable symptoms.The
migration of these bodies by the natural channel and by ulceration into
the duodenum may also be accomplished without any local or systemic
disturbance.[168] That the retention of calculi may not induce any
characteristic reaction by which they may be recognized is probably due
to the fact that the gall-bladder, in which they chiefly form,
possesses but slight sensibility, and as it is in a constantly changing
state of distension or emptiness according to the amount of bile
present, it is obvious that a foreign body made up of the biliary
constituents, and having nearly the same specific gravity as the bile,
is not likely to cause any uneasiness or recognizable functional
disturbances.Furthermore, the slowness with which biliary concretions
form enables the organ to accommodate itself to the new conditions.The
lack of sensibility which is a feature of the gall-bladder, and which I
have had the opportunity to ascertain by actual puncture in an
individual not anaesthetized, is in some instances supported by a
general state of lowered acuteness of perception.There are great
differences in respect to readiness of appreciation and promptness of
response to all kinds of excitation in different individuals.To what
cause soever we may ascribe the lack of sensibility, the fact remains
that in not a few cases of gall-stones in the gall-bladder there are no
symptoms to indicate their presence.On the other hand, there are some
disturbances that have a certain significance.[Footnote 168: Amongst the numerous examples of this kind to be found
recorded may be mentioned the case reported by M. L. Garnier, Agrege a
la Faculte de Medecine de Nancy (_Archives de Physiologie normale et
pathologique_, No.176): An hepatic calculus, weighing 24.5
grammes, was discharged without any symptoms or even consciousness on
the part of the patient, a man of sixty years.He had had colic and
jaundice, but these subsided entirely, and there was no further
disturbance.As has happened in so many instances, this stone must have
ulcerated through into the bowel without causing any recognizable
symptoms.]The subjective signs are uneasiness--a deep-seated sensation of
soreness--felt in the right hypochondrium, increased by taking a full
inspiration and by decubitus on the left side.Pain or soreness,
sometimes an acute pain, is experienced under the scapula near the
angle, at or about the acromion process, and sometimes at the nape of
the neck.In one case under my observation within the past year a
patient who had had several attacks of hepatic colic, the usual
polyangular stones having been recovered, had from time to time severe
pain over the right side of the neck, shoulder, and scapula,
accompanied by a severe herpes zoster in the district affected by the
pain.This is of course an extreme example, but it is very suggestive
of the relation which may exist between hepatic disturbances and
shingles.Attacks of gastric pain coming on some time after food, and
not soon after, as is the case in true gastralgia, are usual in the
early stage of the disease--are constant, according to Cyr,[169] who
quotes approvingly an observation of Leared on this point.Migraine
{1070} or sick headache and vertigo occur in many cases, but it may
well be doubted whether these symptoms are not due to the accompanying
gastro-duodenal catarrh, which is a nearly constant symptom.Acidity,
flatulence, epigastric oppression, a bitter taste, a muddy rather
bilious complexion, and constipation are symptoms belonging to catarrh
of the gastro-duodenal mucous membrane.Some additional information may be supplied by
palpation.When the gall-bladder is distended with gall-stones, or is
in the enlarged state which occurs when the common duct is obstructed,
it may project beneath the inferior border of the liver far enough to
be felt.In thin persons a grating sound, produced by the friction of
the calculi, may be heard, the stethoscope being applied as palpation
is made over the hypochondrium.It is rare that these symptoms can be
elicited, since the calculous affection of the liver occurs for the
most part in persons of full habit, in whom the abdominal walls are too
thick to allow of the necessary manipulation.There may be also some
tenderness on pressure along the inferior margin of the ribs,
especially in the region of the gall-bladder.[Footnote 169: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE MIGRATION OF GALL-STONES BY THE NATURAL
CHANNELS.--A calculus passing into the cystic duct from the
gall-bladder causes the disturbance known as hepatic colic or bilious
colic, because of the jaundice which accompanies the major part of
these seizures.But jaundice is not a necessary element in these cases;
it is not until the concretion reaches the common duct that the passage
of bile into the intestine is interfered with.The gall-bladder has a
function rather conservative than essential, for its duct may be
permanently closed without apparently affecting the health.The time when an attack of hepatic colic is most likely to occur would
seem to be determined by the flow of bile; for this, as has been
stated, is the chief factor in moving calculi along the ducts.As, no
doubt, the presence of the chyme in the duodenum is the stimulus for
the production of bile and also for the contractions of the
gall-bladder, it follows that a few hours after meals is the time when
the attacks of hepatic colic would a priori be expected.This is in
accord with experience, but there are exceptions.In one of the most
formidable cases with which the writer has had to deal--the diagnosis
confirmed by the recovery of the calculi--the most severe attacks
occurred in the early morning.According to Harley,[170] colic from the
passage of inspissated bile occurs when the stomach and duodenum are
most nearly empty--from ten at night until ten in the morning--and this
he relies on as a means of diagnosis, but the exceptions are too
numerous to assign much importance to this circumstance.[Footnote 170: _On Diseases of the Liver_, p.The onset of pain is usually sudden, but it may develop slowly from a
vague uneasiness in the region of the gall-bladder; or after some pain
and soreness at this point, accompanied by nausea, even vomiting, the
paroxysm will begin with very acute pain.The situation of the pain is
by no means constant, and usually varies in position in the same case.The point of maximum intensity is near the ensiform cartilage, outward
and downward two or three inches, about the point of junction of the
cystic and common duct.From or about this region the pain radiates
through the epigastrium, the right hypochondrium, upward into the
chest, {1071} backward under the scapula, and downward and inward
toward the umbilicus.In some instances under my observation the most
acute suffering was located in the right iliac region, in others in the
lumbar region, and in still others in the epigastrium.The position of
the pain may be such as to draw attention from the liver, and thus
greatly confuse the diagnosis.In a well-defined attack the pain is
intense, shooting, and boring, irregularly paroxysmal; the patient
writhes in agony, screams and groans, rolls from side to side, or walks
partly bent, holding the part with a gentle pressure or rubbing with an
agonized tension of feeling.Meanwhile the countenance is expressive of
the intensest suffering, is pallid and drawn, and the body is covered
with a cold sweat.Nausea presently supervenes, and with the efforts to
vomit a keen thrust of pain and a sense of cramp dart through the
epigastrium and side.Very considerable depression of the vital powers
occurs; the pulse becomes small, feeble, and slow, or very rapid and
feeble.The patient may pass into a condition of collapse, and, indeed,
the pain of hepatic colic may cause death by sudden arrest of the
heart's action.The cases which prove fatal in this way are doubtless
examples of fatty heart, the degeneration of the cardiac muscle being a
result of the action of the same factors as those which cause
gall-stones to form, if the relation of general steatosis to these
bodies which I have set forth prove to be true.The pain is not
continuously so violent as above expressed: it remits from time to
time, and seems about to cease altogether when a sudden access of
anguish is experienced and the former suffering is renewed, and, it may
be, more savagely than before.The pain of an attack of hepatic colic
has no fixed duration.It will depend on the size of the calculus, on
the point where impacted, and on the impressionability of the subject.The severity of the seizures varies within very wide limits.The attack
may consist in a transient colic-like pain, in a mere sense of
soreness, in epigastric uneasiness with nausea, or it may be an agony
sufficient to cause profound depression of the powers of life--to
destroy life, indeed.The usual attack of hepatic colic is one in which
severe suffering is experienced until relief is obtained by the
exhibition of anodynes.Under these circumstances the subsidence of the
pain may be rather gradual or it may be sudden: in the former case, as
the effects of the anodyne are produced, we may suppose that the spasm
subsides and the stone moves onward, at last dropping into the
intestine: an enchanting sense of relief is at once experienced.Very
serious nervous disturbances may accompany the pain.Paroxysms of
hysteria may be excited in the hysterical; convulsions occur in those
having the predisposition to them from any cause, and in the epileptic.The onset of a severe seizure is announced by chilliness, sometimes by
a severe chill.Now and then the paroxysms commence with the chill, and
the pain follows.It occasionally happens that the attacks in respect
to the order in which the symptoms occur, and in their regularity as to
time, behave like an ordinary ague.In fact, there appear to be two
modes or manifestations of the attacks of hepatic colic in malarious
localities: those in which the phenomena are merely an outcome of the
passage of the calculi; those in which an attack of intermittent fever
is excited by the pain and disturbance of hepatic colic.To the first
Charcot[171] {1072} has applied the phrase fievre intermittente
hepatique.It is supposed to correspond pathogenetically to urethral
fever produced by the passage of a catheter.On the other hand, the
second form of intermittent can occur only under the conditions
producing ague.A calculus passing in a subject affected with chronic
malarial poisoning, the latent malarial influence is aroused into full
activity, and the resulting seizure is compounded of the two factors.The truly malarial form of calculus fever differs from the traumatic in
its regular periodicity and the methodical sequence of the attacks,
which occur in the order of an intermittent quotidian or tertian.During the attacks of hepatic colic, when protracted and severe, a
sense of chilliness or distinct chills occur, sometimes with the
regularity of an intermittent; but these differ from the seizures which
the chill inaugurates at distinct times, the intervening period being
free from disturbance.[Footnote 171: _Lecons sur la Maladies du Foie_, p.The fever which accompanies some severe paroxysms of hepatic colic has
a distinctly intermittent character, hence the name applied to it by
Charcot.There are two forms of this calculus fever as it occurs in
malarious localities: one intermittent, coming on during a protracted
case, and immediately connected with and dependent on the passage of
the stone; the other a regular intermittent quotidian or tertian, which
determines and accompanies the paroxysm of colic.A case occurring
under my observation very recently, in which these phenomena were
exhibited and the calculi recovered, proves the existence of such a
form of the malady.In this case with the onset of the pain a severe
chill occurred; then the fever rose, followed by the sweat, during
which the pain ceased, but much soreness and tenderness about the
region of the gall-bladder, and jaundice, followed in the usual way.At
the so-called septenary periods also attacks come on in accordance with
the usual laws of recurrence of malarial fevers.In many instances, probably a
majority, the pulse is not accelerated, rather slowed, and the
temperature does not rise above normal.The inflammation which follows
an attack of hepatic colic will be accompanied by some elevation of the
body-heat, and fever will occur when ulceration of the duct and
perforation cause a local peritonitis; but these conditions are quite
apart from those which obtain in the migration of calculi by the
natural channel.Nausea and vomiting are invariable symptoms of hepatic colic.First the
contents of the stomach are brought up, then some glairy mucus only,
with repeated and exhausting straining efforts; and with the sudden
cessation of the pain there may appear in the vomit a quantity of
bilious matter, the contents of the gall-bladder liberated by the
passage of the stone into the intestine.If bile is present in the
vomit from the beginning, it may be concluded that the obstruction is
not complete.The abdomen may be distended with gas--is
usually, indeed, when constipation exists.Free purgation gives great
relief.The stools are composed of scybalae chiefly at first, afterward
of a brownish offensive liquid, and when jaundice supervenes they
become whitish in color, pasty, and semi-solid.Now and then it happens
that a copious movement of the bowels takes place as the attack is
impending, but during the paroxysm no action occurs.Jaundice is an important, but not an invariable, symptom.It comes on
within the first twenty-four hours succeeding the paroxysm, and appears
{1073} first in the conjunctiva, thence spreading over the body
generally.The intensity of the jaundice depends on the amount of the
obstruction: if complete, the body is intensely yellow; and if partial,
the tint may be very light.The very slight degree of obstruction which
suffices to determine the flow of bile backward has been already
stated.There may be no jaundice, although all the other symptoms of
the passage of gall-stones may be present.Such is the state of the
case when a calculus enters and is arrested in the cystic duct.Under
these circumstances the natural history differs from that which obtains
when the obstruction is in the common duct and ends abruptly by the
discharge of the calculus into the intestine.After the persistence of
the symptoms of hepatic colic for a variable period without jaundice,
this sign of obstruction may appear, indicating the removal of the
stone from the cystic into the common duct.The symptoms accompanying
the jaundice--the hebetude of mind, the slow pulse, the itching of the
skin, the dark- urine--have been sufficiently detailed in the
section on that topic in another part of this article.The duration of the jaundice is different in different cases, and is
influenced by the degree and persistence of the obstruction.When the
obstruction is partial and the stone is soon removed, the jaundice will
be slight and will disappear in a day or two; on the other hand, when
the stone completely blocks the passage and is slowly dislodged, the
jaundice will be intense and will persist for ten days to two weeks.After the paroxysm has passed, if severe, the liver will be swollen,
more or less tenderness will be developed by pressure, and in some
instances, a local peritonitis coming on, there will occur the usual
symptoms of that condition.Although all the symptoms produced by the passage of biliary calculi
may be present, some uncertainty will always be felt unless the body
causing the disturbance is recovered from the feces.A
properly-conducted search is therefore necessary.As this is so often
done inefficiently and the calculus not found, an error of diagnosis
may seem to have occurred.Every stool should be examined in the mode
hereinafter described for a number of days after the attack until the
calculus is found.It should be remembered that only air-dried calculi
float on water.The stool, as soon as passed, should be slowly stirred
up in water sufficient to make a thin mixture, and all solid particles
removed for further examination, the thinner portion poured off, and
more water added from time to time until only solids remain at last.It
should not be forgotten that masses of inspissated bile, biliary sand,
may produce symptoms not unlike those due to gall-stones proper, and
hence all particles having the appearance of this material should be
examined chemically.Place some of the supposed bile on a white plate
and pour over it some drops of strong sulphuric acid, when the
biliverdin will take on a brilliant scarlet color.The discharge of particles of inspissated bile causes symptoms not
unlike those due to the migration of biliary calculi, but there are
points of difference.A strongly-marked case diagnosticated biliary
calculi, and in which masses of inspissated bile were discharged in
great quantity, will furnish the symptomatology to be now described.The onset of the paroxysms of pain is less abrupt than is the case with
gall-stones, and the attacks may occur at any time; the pain also
subsides more gradually, and hardly {1074} ceases at any time, but
revives every now and then, so that several days, even weeks, may be
occupied with one seizure.Jaundice is less apt to follow, and indeed
well-defined jaundice rarely occurs in this affection.There is much
swelling of the liver, also considerable tenderness, and relief is most
certainly afforded by free purgation, anodynes seeming rather to keep
up the disturbance, probably by checking the hepatic secretions.Attacks of hepatic colic may be expected to recur when a calculus with
multiple facets migrates, but the time when its associates may be
expected to move cannot be predicated on any data now available.Single
attacks may happen at intervals of weeks, months, or years.The
migration of one large stone may so dilate the ducts as to facilitate
the passage of those that remain behind, thus ensuring a recurrence of
the seizures at an early period.IMPACTION OF CALCULI AND MIGRATION BY ARTIFICIAL ROUTES.--The point at
which impaction takes place is an element of great importance.The size
of the calculus is far from being decisive as to the certainty of
impaction or as to the untoward results.A not unfrequent accident is
the blocking of the cystic duct at its opening, thus preventing the
influx or outgo of bile from the gall-bladder.If the stone does not
ulcerate through, in this position it does no damage, for the
gall-bladder, as has been stated, may be closed without any apparent
detriment.Just at the bend of the cystic duct, near its origin, is the
point where arrest of a calculus is most likely to take place.The next
most likely point is the duodenal end of the common duct.When
impaction occurs a local inflammation comes on, an exudation is poured
out, ulceration begins, and presently the peritoneum is reached.Adhesions usually form with the neighboring organs, but now and then
perforation takes place, and bile, pus, and the calculus are
precipitated into the peritoneal cavity.A fatal peritonitis follows,
as a rule; but rarely the inflammation is localized, and an abscess
forms which pursues the usual course of such accumulations; or
adhesions may take place about the site of the perforation and prevent
a general inflammation of the peritoneum.In this way a very large sac
may be produced, with the ultimate result of rupture into the general
cavity, although a fistulous communication may be established with some
neighboring organ, permitting safe discharge in this direction.A gall-stone impacted in one of the hepatic ducts or in the main duct,
ulcerating through, may form an abscess not distinguishable from other
solitary hepatic abscesses except by the presence of the concretion
causing the mischief and the absence of the usual conditions giving
rise to these accumulations of pus.It is probable that fatal abscesses
of the liver not infrequently are caused in this way in extra-tropical
countries.Adhesions forming to neighboring hollow organs or to the
external integument, such abscesses discharge, carrying out the
calculus with them.In this way may be explained the discharge by the
intestine of calculi much too large to have passed by the natural route
and unattended by the usual symptoms of hepatic colic.These
gastro-intestinal biliary fistulae extend from the gall-bladder and the
larger ducts to the stomach, to the duodenum, and to the transverse
colon; but of these the communication with the stomach is the least
common.The adhesion of the gall-bladder or common duct to the duodenum
or colon may be direct, exudations uniting {1075} the two parts without
the intervention of an abscess cavity, or such a sac or cavity may be
interposed.In some cases the discharge of biliary calculi is effected
through these routes with so little disturbance as to escape notice, or
the symptoms may be only vague indications of a local inflammation in
the neighborhood of the liver.Biliary fistulae communicating externally, caused by the migration of
calculi, are comparatively common.They have the clinical history, and
are usually treated as cases, of hepatic abscess.Sometimes hundreds of
calculi are thus discharged.In such instances it may be assumed that
communication has been established with the gall-bladder.Hepatic
abscess thus due to the migration of calculi may discharge into the
pelvis of the kidney, into the ascending vena cava, or through the
lung, but these places of outlet are comparatively uncommon.COURSES AND COMPLICATIONS.--Although symptoms cease for the time being
when the calculus passes into the duodenum, and although in most
instances no after unpleasant effects are experienced, there are cases
in which the presence of the concretion in the intestine proves to be
fruitful of mischief.Calculi of very large size--from a pigeon's to a
hen's egg--are also found in the intestine, without the occurrence of
symptoms indicative of their migration.It has been shown that this
silent migration of calculi from the liver-passages to the intestinal
is not uncommon.Hepatic concretions are distinguishable from the
intestinal by their crystalline form and by their composition.The
former are usually polyangular, and are composed of cholesterin
crystallized about a nucleus of bile-pigment, inspissated bile, or
mucus.After entrance into the intestine, lime salts and mucus are
deposited in successive layers, so that the form of the calculus is
modified and its size increased.The solitary ovoid concretion is most
frequently found in the intestine, without previous symptoms of hepatic
source, and, although increased in size in the intestine, it retains
its original shape.A specimen of this kind now in my possession
illustrates these points.It is composed of cholesterin crystallized in
radiating lines and concentric rings about a central nucleus of
inspissated bile.Around the hepatic concretion there have formed
layers of lime and mucus since it has reached the intestine, and after
drying this rind became brittle and was readily detached.The
polyangular calculus is apt to form the nucleus of a scybala-like mass
of feces; hence in the search for these bodies every such mass should
be broken up.An example of this has recently come under my own
observation.Concretions of all sizes, having reached the intestines,
as a rule pass down without creating any commotion, and are silently
discharged.Obstruction of the bowels is one of the results.A great may cases have
been collected by Murchison,[172] as many more by Leichtenstern,[173]
of impaction of the intestine produced by an accumulation of feces
about a biliary concretion.A calculus may be retained in a fold or
diverticulum of the small intestine, and may indeed cause a loop to be
formed which in turn readily twists, becoming an immovable obstruction.This mode of obstructing the bowels is less common than the simple
impaction.It is affirmed by some authorities, especially by Von
Schuppel, that obstruction of the bowels--impaction--is more often
caused by stones that have ulcerated through into the {1076} intestines
than by those that have descended by the common duct; and this
conclusion must be reached if jaundice has not been present.It is not
only the size of the calculus which determines impaction, as has been
stated: several may be agglutinated in one mass, and reflex spasm of
the muscular layer may be induced by their presence in the bowel.Nevertheless, some enormous concretions have been found in the canal,
and others have been discharged without special trouble.Hilton Fagge
exhibited to the Pathological Society[174] of London two gall-stones
passed with the stools, measuring 2-1/2 by 1-1/5 inches in long and
short diameter, and Fauconneau-Dufresne[175] refers to concretions of
the size of a hen's egg.Mention has been made of one in the writer's
possession of the size of a pullet's egg, which, until its discharge,
caused a train of characteristic symptoms.These immense bodies may
have ulcerated through from the gall-bladder or may have grown by
successive deposits of carbonate and phosphate of lime after reaching
the intestine.[Footnote 172: _Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, p.[Footnote 173: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 174: _Transactions of the London Pathological Society_, vol.cit._]

The symptoms caused by the presence of concretions in the intestines
are, when pronounced, sufficiently characteristic.At a variable period
after an attack or attacks of hepatic colic the disturbance begins.The
condition of impaction above referred to does not differ from ordinary
fecal accumulation.It is true that occasionally the intestinal
irritation due to the presence of these bodies in some instances
preceded the symptoms of impaction, but usually there is no evidence to
indicate that the stoppage of the bowel is due to anything else than
feces.The irritability manifested by the intestinal mucous membrane
when gall-stones are present varies remarkably.There may be only some
ill-defined pain which, as a rule, indicates the position of the
calculus, or it may be pain with a feeling of soreness, or it may take
the form of violent colic, with nausea, vomiting, and depression.In my
own cases pain was experienced at or near the ileo-caecal valve, where
one was lodged, and along the descending colon, where the others were;
the pain and soreness ceased when these bodies were discharged.In a few instances gall-stones are brought up by vomiting.The most
remarkable example of this is a case to be found in the _Transactions
of the Pathological Society_ (vol.129): A woman ninety-four
years of age vomited a stone the size of a nutmeg.In the reported
examples violent pain, nausea, and much vomiting preceded the discharge
of the calculus.Like other foreign bodies, a gall-stone may ulcerate through the
intestine, producing fatal peritonitis.Many conditions due to the presence of biliary concretions, and which
arise during their migrations, may be viewed as complications.Many of
those produced directly have been described as a part of the proper
course of the malady; others are local and reflex, and these may with
propriety be considered as complications.First in importance are those
due to obstruction and the local inflammation.The passage of a calculus along the duct excites an inflammation of the
mucous membrane, which by contiguity of tissue invades the peritoneal
layer if the stone is retained for a sufficient time, and especially if
it is immovably lodged.The stoppage in the flow of bile leads to
dilatation of the ducts, and a change takes place in the character of
that fluid, {1077} owing to the admixture of mucus with the bile and to
the pouring out of a pathological secretion: it loses the bilious
appearance and becomes a merely sero-purulent fluid.Serious changes
ensue in the structure of the liver, as was first suggested by O. Wyss
and Leyden, and afterward more especially by Wickham Legg[176] and
Charcot.[177] A ligature to the common duct in animals is followed in
so short a time as two weeks by hyperplasia of the connective tissue
and atrophy of the gland-elements.It has been ascertained that similar
changes ensue in man from the impaction of a calculus in the common
duct.Under these circumstances the size of the liver, as indicated by
the area of hepatic dulness, at first enlarges, and subsequently more
or less contraction, coincident with the atrophy, ensues.When the
cystic duct is obstructed the contents of the gall-bladder increase,
and become ultimately sero-purulent (dropsy).In some instances, the
walls of the abdomen being thin, a globular elastic tumor may be felt
projecting from beneath the liver.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports for 1873_.See also
_Treatise on Diseases of the Liver_, by the same author, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 177: _Lecons_.]Angiocholitis, or inflammation of the duct, is caused by the passage,
especially by the impaction, of a calculus.The inflammation may extend
by contiguity of tissue and involve the surrounding parts.Several
cases have been examined by the writer in which the gall-bladder and
the cystic and common duct were imbedded in a mass of organized
exudation.An extension of inflammation may take place, and be confined
to the hepatic peritoneum.Heavy organized exudations will form,
adhesions be contracted to the diaphragm, to the parietal peritoneum,
and to the neighboring organs, and the capsule, thickened and
contracting, will ultimately induce changes in the structure of the
adjacent part of the liver.When the inflammation extends to the
peritoneum there are the usual systemic symptoms, and locally acute
pain, increased by the respiratory movements and by pressure, and
assuming a constrictive character; nausea and frequent vomiting, and
often a very troublesome hiccough, caused, doubtless, by implication of
some branches of the phrenic nerve; constipation, etc.The relation of biliary colic to cancer of the biliary passages was
first noted by Frerichs, who ascertained the occurrence of gall-stones
in 9 out of 11 cases of cancer of these parts.Hilton Fagge[178]
reports a case of the kind, and the writer can add another from his own
observations.The most important of the reflex symptoms are those pertaining to the
circulatory system.The action of the heart becomes irregular in rhythm
and diminishes in force.The circulation of the bile acids in the blood
causes slowing of the heart's action, as has been set forth in the
section on jaundice; but that is a direct consequence, and is not a
reflex impression.Potain was the first to show that the structure of
the heart is affected.A mitral murmur is a recognized symptom in the
icterus of gall-stones, but Potain[179] has shown that the real seat of
this murmur is the tricuspid, and that the affection of the heart is a
dilatation of the right cavities.The physiological reason for this
condition of the heart is the rise of tension in the pulmonary artery,
which is secondary to irritation of the splanchnic nerves; and to this
factor is also due the reduplication of the first sound and the
accentuation of the second sound--characteristic signs of the cardiac
change in these cases.[Footnote 179: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affec.cit._]

{1078} There are certain reflex nervous troubles in cases of hepatic
colic, some of them of great importance.One of the lesser troubles is
herpes zoster.A very violent attack in the course of the distribution
of the first, second, and third cervical nerves has happened in a case
under the writer's observation.There have been reported from time to
time cases of sudden death during the paroxysms of hepatic colic, in
which a calculus lodged in Vater's diverticulum, at the intestinal
extremity of the common duct, was the cause of the accident.An
explanation of this result is to be found in the intimate nervous
communications between the liver and the heart through the solar plexus
and the large number of ganglia contained in Vater's diverticulum.The
most severe pain is felt as the calculus is passing through the orifice
of the common duct into the intestine, and here also the spasm of the
muscular fibre is most tense.The so-called crushing-blow experiment of
Goltz illustrates how intense suffering, such as the passage of a
gall-stone, can paralyze the heart through the solar plexus.The
depression of the heart's action does not always occur on the instant,
but it may be gradual--several hours, even a day or two, being occupied
in the suspension of activity.Leigh of Liverpool[180] has reported an
example of death in six hours in a female of thirty, previously in good
health; Cornillon,[181] another in a female of fifty-three, who died in
twelve hours from the beginning of the paroxysm; Williamson,[182] a
female of fifty-one years, who expired on the fourth day;
Habershon,[183] two, who died during the paroxysms at a period not
stated; and Brouardel, one which was the subject of a medico-legal
investigation.In the first case the calculus was yet in the
gall-bladder, the appearances indicating that persistent spasms had
occurred to force the calculus into the cystic duct; in the others in
which the position of the stone is mentioned, it was engaged in the
orifice of the common duct or had reached the intestine.[Footnote 180: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1867, vol.[Footnote 182: _The Lancet_ (London), vol.[Footnote 183: _Lectures on the Pneumogastric_, 3d Lecture.]In several instances sudden death has resulted from uncontrollable
vomiting induced by the paroxysms of hepatic colic.Trousseau[184]
mentions a case in which strangulated hernia and death ensued in
consequence of the violent vomiting brought on by the passage of a
calculus.[Footnote 184: _Clinique medicale_.]DIAGNOSIS.--Unless the distension of the gall-bladder is sufficient to
cause a recognizable tumor, gall-stones in that organ do not produce
symptoms by which they can be diagnosticated.If sudden attacks of
violent pain in the right hypochondrium, accompanied by nausea and
vomiting and followed by jaundice, have occurred from time to time,
then the presence of biliary concretions may be suspected if the
symptoms belonging to them are present in the intervals between the
seizures.The migrations of calculi produce symptoms so characteristic
that error is hardly possible.The only disorders with which an attack
of hepatic colic may be confounded are gastralgia and hepatalgia.As
regards the first, the distinction is made by the seat of pain, by the
absence of after jaundice, and by the lack of a concretion passed by
stool.As the diagnosis may depend on the finding a concretion, the
writer must again affirm the importance of a properly-conducted search
of all the stools passed for several days after the paroxysm.{1079} Hepatalgia is diagnosticated with great difficulty, for the pain
has the same seat, the same character, but as a rule it does not
terminate so abruptly, is not accompanied by such severe vomiting and
depression, jaundice is absent, and no stone can be found in the
evacuations.Both gastralgia and hepatalgia occur in the subjects of
neurotic disturbances--in the pale, delicate, and hysterical--whereas,
as a rule, hepatic colic happens to the obese, to the persons of active
digestion addicted to the pleasures of the table.The passage of calculi may be confounded with flatulent colic, with the
pain caused by lead and other mineral poisons, with impaction, internal
strangulation, local peritonitis, and similar causes of sudden and
violent pain.The differentiation is made by attention to the seat and
character of the pain, by the previous history, and especially by the
absence of jaundice and of a concretion.From renal colic the hepatic
is separated by the position of the pain, by the direction taken by it,
and by the retraction of the testicle, the irritability of the bladder,
and the appearance of blood in the urine--all characteristic symptoms
of the renal affection.TREATMENT.--The treatment of biliary concretions includes the remedial
management for the calculi in position, for the paroxysms of hepatic
colic caused by the migration of these bodies, and for the results and
complications.Treatment of the Calculus State: Of Inspissated Bile.--As the particles
of inspissated bile are deposited along the larger hepatic ducts, and
form in consequence of a deficiency in the amount of glycocholate and
taurocholate of soda, two methods of treatment are to be carried out:
free purgation by an active cholagogue to wash out the offending
substance, and the exhibition of a soda salt to promote the alkalinity
of the bile and the consequent solution of the bile-pigment.Harley's
method, which he strongly urges, consists in the administration of "one
or two drachms of sulphate of soda in a bitter infusion every morning
before breakfast, or from twenty to thirty grains of bicarbonate of
soda, along with a drachm of taraxacum-juice in a bitter infusion,
every night at bedtime at regulated intervals for a month or so,
according to the constitution of the patient and the severity of the
symptoms."As persons who suffer from inspissation of the bile are naturally
bilious, it is of the first importance in the prophylactic treatment to
regulate the diet.Indulgence in malt liquors, in fatty and saccharine
articles of food, must be forbidden.Acid fermentation in the course of
duodenal digestion should be prevented by withholding the starches and
sugars.Peptonized foods, given with an alkali, are highly useful.Milk, fresh meat, and the succulent vegetables are the proper
constituents of a diet for these subjects.Bread is one of the most
offending articles, and should be restricted in amount as much as
possible.Next to a suitable diet, systematic exercise is a measure of the
highest utility in these cases.A daily morning sponge bath of a weak
alkaline water not only maintains the skin in a healthy state, but also
promotes the oxidation processes of the body.The alkaline mineral
waters of Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, and other States, especially
of the Bethesda Spring of Wisconsin, may be drunk with great advantage
to accomplish the same purpose.{1080} We possess direct means for preventing inspissation of the
bile--remedies which act in the physiological way by increasing the
proportion of glycocholate and taurocholate of soda.Harley prefers the
sulphate and bicarbonate for this purpose, but my experience is in
favor of the cholate and phosphate of sodium, especially the latter;
for, whilst it plays the part of a soda salt, it exerts a decided
cholagogue action, thus effecting the results achieved by the combined
use of sulphate of soda and taraxacum.A cure may be confidently looked
for in this malady by the persistent use of sodium phosphate--drachm j
ter in die.It seems to act more efficiently when given dissolved in
hot water.The paroxysms of hepatic colic due to the passage of inspissated bile
are to be treated in the same way as when this condition of things is
caused by the migration of formed calculi.The action of cholagogue
purgatives is more decidedly beneficial in the attacks due to the
passage of inspissated bile.Biliary Calculi in Situ.--Notwithstanding their crystalline form and
firmness of texture, it is possible to effect the gradual solution of
biliary calculi.Outside of the body it is easy to dissolve a calculus
in chloroform, in Durande's remedy, etc., if time enough be given, but
the problem is a far more difficult one when the calculus is in
position in the gall-bladder or in a hepatic duct.As Trousseau[185]
has wisely observed, it is not safe to apply to conditions within the
body conclusions reached by experiments in the laboratory.Nevertheless, facts are known which justify the belief that an
impression may be made on concretions in the gall-bladder.The motion
of respiration and the voluntary actions of the abdominal muscles cause
more or less attrition and breaking off of the angles and margins of
the crystals, thus permitting the solvent action of the bile.If,
however, the bile continues in the state in which it was at the time of
the crystallization of the cholesterin, it will make no impression on
this substance.We have now the means of restoring its power to
dissolve crystallized cholesterin.As a necessary preliminary, fracture
of the crystals must be effected.This may be accomplished, when the
natural forces have failed to effect it, by manipulation of the
gall-bladder through the walls of the abdomen, but especially by
faradization.Excellent results have been achieved by this
last-mentioned expedient, but no satisfactory explanation has been made
of its methodus medendi, unless we accept the mechanical effect of the
muscular movements.In applying the faradic current an electrode is
introduced into the rectum, and the other, a sponge well moistened, is
placed over the gall-bladder.An interrupted galvanic current is
indicated, the electrodes in the position just mentioned, when a
migrating calculus is stopped on its way.Such an application has
rendered important service in a few cases.[Footnote 185: _Clinique medicale de l'Hotel Dieu de Paris_.]Except that calculi have been found in a state of decay, their angles
and edges broken, divided by cleavage, there is no evidence that they
have undergone solution when in situ, except the clinical evidence
which consists in a disappearance of the symptoms.The remedy of
Durande, which consists in a mixture of ether and turpentine--three
parts of the former and two of the latter--has been celebrated since
the close of the last century, and is yet much employed in France,
notably at Vichy.It {1081} is preferred by Cyr,[186] who advises its
administration in capsules taken immediately before meals.Chloroform
readily dissolves calculi out of the body, and hence it has been
proposed, and indeed much used, for the purpose of effecting their
solution in the gall-bladder; but, as Trousseau urges, there is no
warrant for the belief.Corlieu,[187] who first proposed its use, and
afterward Bouchut,[188] maintained that chloroform does exert this
solvent action, and reported cases in confirmation; but there are so
many sources of fallacy that such evidence must be viewed with
suspicion.It has usually been administered in small doses (five
minims) three times a day for a long period.That it is beneficial by
stimulating the flow of pancreatic secretion and by allaying spasms is
probably true, but that any quantity which can be administered in
safety will act as a solvent of cholesterin concretions cannot be
believed.[Footnote 186: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 187: _Gazette des Hopitaux_, 1856, June 19.][Footnote 188: _Bulletin gen.If solution of hepatic calculi is possible under any circumstances, the
most rational mode of effecting it would seem to be to restore that
condition of the bile which in the normal state maintains cholesterin
in the state of solution.Cholesterin is precipitated and crystallizes
about a nucleus when the glycocholate and taurocholate of soda are
deficient in amount.The agents most effective in restoring the solvent
power of the bile are the salts of soda, of which the sulphate is
preferred by Harley.In 1873 the cholate of soda was brought forward by
Schiff, who prescribed it in doses of 50 centigrammes (8 grains nearly)
three times a day, to be gradually increased until digestive or
circulatory troubles arose.This remedy, which is eminently rational
from the point of view above indicated, has apparently been of decided
service in many published cases and in the writer's experience.It will
be found, however, that five grains three times a day is as large a
quantity as can be easily borne.Another soda salt which in my own hands has proved in a high degree
effective is the phosphate.As has been explained when referring to its
use in cases of disorders due to inspissated bile, it has a distinct
cholagogue action, but the chief sources of its utility in this
affection are its chemical and resolvent powers.The usual quantity is
one drachm three times a day, dissolved in sufficient warm water.Bile itself, in the form of inspissated ox-gall, was formerly much
used, a scruple to a drachm being given three times a day, and not
without good results.It was also prescribed with chloride of ammonium.For the gastro-duodenal catarrh and the accompanying catarrh of the
bile-ducts this combination is sometimes useful.I have recently proposed a new expedient for effecting the solution of
hepatic calculi.This method consists in puncture of the gall-bladder
with a fine exploring-trocar, and the injection through the canula,
after withdrawing the stylet, of a suitable solvent.Durande's remedy,
chloroform, and other solvents can be introduced in this way without
injury to the parts.I have punctured the gall-bladder, removed its
contents, and explored its interior without damaging the organ in any
way and without leaving after traces.The measure proposed offers no
special difficulties in its execution.The Paroxysms of Hepatic Colic.--The pain of hepatic colic being {1082}
the most acute suffering known to man--in its severest form at
least--the most powerful anodynes are required.The measures employed
for relief of pain happen to be the most efficient for promoting the
expulsion of the calculus and for limiting, if not preventing, the
subsequent inflammation.As soon as the character of the seizure is
manifest a hypodermatic injection of morphine and atropine--1/8 to 1/2
grain of the former and 1/200 to 1/80 grain of the latter--should be
given; ether administered by inhalation if necessary; and by the
stomach chloroform, chlorodyne, or chloral.As the stomach is usually
exceedingly irritable, the subcutaneous injection of remedies is a
precious resource: this failing or contraindicated, relief may be given
by the rectal injection of laudanum or chlorodyne.As relief is often
afforded by the act of vomiting, the attempts to empty the stomach
should be encouraged, and to this end large draughts of warm water
should be given.Hot fomentations and mustard plaster should be applied
over the right hypochondrium, and an entire warm bath may be used if
available.Great relief is usually afforded by the action of purgatives.The
irritability of the stomach forbids the employment of drastic
purgatives, yet podophyllin resin is warmly commended by Dobell.It
must be given in small doses, and preferably dissolved in spirit.Calomel in one-grain doses, every four hours until it purges, allays
nausea and lessens the after-uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, but
mercurial treatment given with a view to a supposed cholagogue effect
only does evil by prolonged administration, especially if ptyalism is
induced.If evidences of portal congestion are present, such remedies
as euonymin, iridin, baptisin, and others of the cholagogue group give
good results.The most effective of the remedies of this kind is
ipecacuanha, given in purgative doses: the emesis induced by it favors
the extrusion of the stone, and the powerful cholagogue effect relieves
the portal congestion.Twenty grains at once, and repeated if need be
in three hours, is a suitable quantity.The various complications which may occur, and the results which follow
the migration of the calculus, require treatment adapted to the
conditions existing, and will be mentioned in the sections devoted to
these topics.Occlusion of the Biliary Passages; Stenosis of the Ductus Communis
Choledochus.DEFINITION.--By occlusion of the biliary passages is meant an
obstruction, internal or external, of the hepatic, cystic, or common
duct.The causes of the obstruction are various, but the results are
quite uniform; hence the term includes a complexus of symptoms of a
very distinctive type.Occlusion may be congenital or acquired: it is
the latter with which we have especially to deal.Stenosis signifies a narrowing which in its extremest form produces a
nearly complete obstruction; when the canal is entirely closed the term
occlusion is applied.Stenosis also may be congenital or acquired.PATHOGENY.--The conditions producing narrowing of a hepatic duct or its
complete obstruction are numerous, and some of them complex in their
relations.As regards the ducts themselves, the interference may {1083}
be entirely within the canal, or it may affect the walls, or it may be
wholly extraneous; as, for example, when a cancer of the pancreas
encroaches on the common duct.It will be convenient to consider the
causes of stenosis and obstruction from these points of view: 1,
internal; 2, of the duct walls; 3, extraneous.The most usual situations for the occurrence of those changes that lead
to occlusion by inflammatory adhesions are the beginning of the cystic
duct, obstruction of which is of little moment, and the end of the
common duct, which finally proves fatal.The passage of a large polyangular calculus may cause such irritation,
abrasion of the epithelium, and subsequent inflammatory exudation as to
effect a direct union of the opposing sides of the canal.This takes
place at the beginning of the cystic duct especially, since, owing to
the spasm of the gall-bladder and the absence of muscular fibres in the
walls of the duct, the stone crushes into, without passing through, the
canal.The inflammatory exudation thus excited may close the duct.Not
unfrequently the gall-bladder, full of calculi, is thus shut off from
the liver permanently.In one instance the writer has seen a calculus
wedged into the orifice of the cystic duct, whilst just beyond the
lumen was permanently obstructed by an organized exudation.Permanent
closure of the cystic duct is of far less consequence than of the
common duct, and may, indeed, be a conservative condition, as in the
case above mentioned, where numerous polyangular calculi may have
migrated, except the closure of the passage.The most usual point of obstruction in the course of the common duct is
the intestinal end, but various processes are employed to effect it.The first in importance is catarrhal inflammation.This seems the more
credible when it is remembered that to a simple catarrh of the mucous
membrane is due the temporary stoppage of the duct, producing jaundice
in much the largest proportion of cases.When the epithelium is
detached and granulations spring up from the basement membrane,
adhesions of the surfaces will readily take place, and the union may be
so complete as that all traces of the duct will disappear.It is
probable that in many, if not in most, of these cases the initial
condition of the canal is that of simple catarrh, the more positive
changes in the mucous membrane arising from peculiarities in the
tissues of the individual affected, or from local injury caused by the
passage of a concretion or irritation of pathological secretions of the
duodenum.Stenosis, and finally occlusion, of the common duct may arise from the
cicatrization of an ulcer.They
may result from catarrhal inflammation of a chronic type, much new
connective-tissue material forming, and in the process of
cicatrization, with the contraction belonging to it, the lumen of the
canal is so far filled up that the passage of bile is effectually
prevented.They may be produced in that state of the tissues which
accompanies certain cachectic and profoundly adynamic conditions, as in
severe typhoid fever.Such ulcers may also be due to the mechanical
injury effected by the migration of a gall-stone.In cicatrizing, a
tight stricture, impermeable to the passage of bile, may result, or the
lumen of the canal be entirely obliterated.In the latter case the duct
itself may disappear and leave no trace.An ulcer situated at the
duodenal end of the common duct and extending into the {1084} duodenum
may also in the process of healing so contract as to render the orifice
impermeable to bile.The same effect may follow the cicatrization of an
ulcer of the duodenum in the immediate vicinity of the orifice of the
common duct.Without the intervention of an ulcer as a means of explaining closure
of the common duct, this accident may be caused by a catarrhal
inflammation which effects denudation of the basement membrane, and
thence union may be produced by the mere contact of the
freshly-granulating surfaces.Congenital occlusion of the bile-ducts or
obstruction occurring in a few days after birth, it is probable, is
effected in this way, but no direct evidence of the process has thus
far been offered.During intra-uterine life, as at any period in
after-life, it seems necessary to the production of such changes that a
peculiar constitutional state must exist; otherwise, such a result
might happen to every case of catarrhal inflammation of the bile-ducts.The extent of the changes is further evidence in the same direction;
for not only are the walls of the duct in permanent apposition and
adhesion, but the duct degenerates into a mere fibrous cord, and in
some instances is nearly, even entirely, obliterated.[189]

[Footnote 189: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.The cystic or common duct--the latter to be chiefly considered--may be
occluded by the retention in its lumen of some foreign body.The
impaction of a biliary calculus has already been repeatedly referred
to, but there are some additional points demanding consideration.The
larger concretions may be stopped in the neck of the gall-bladder;
those small enough to enter the canal may be arrested at its bend
behind the neck, and the very entrance of the cystic duct may be
blocked, as in a case examined by the writer.The hepatic duct is very rarely permanently occluded.As the calibre of
this canal continuously enlarges downward, there is no point at which a
stone is likely to be arrested; nevertheless, it occasionally happens
that such an obstruction does occur.An example has occurred under the
observation of the writer, but the cause was a gunshot wound of the
liver.The most usual, and for very obvious reasons the most important, of the
sites where occlusion occurs is the common duct and at the termination
of the duct in the small intestine, the intestinal orifice.Just behind
and to the right of its orifice the duct is dilated into a fossa--the
diverticulum Vateri; and here concretions of a size to pass along the
common duct are stopped.It is not essential that the stone fit the
canal: it may do so and prevent any bile passing into the duodenum; it
may be a polyangular body, and, though wedged in, leave spaces through
which more or less can slowly trickle.Again, the diverticulum may contain numerous concretions,
which distend the canal greatly, but through the interstices of which
some bile can flow.Other foreign bodies very rarely close the intestinal end of the ductus
communis; thus, for example, a cherry-seed, a plum-seed, a mass of
raisin-seeds, may slip into the orifice after the passage of a
gall-stone has stretched it sufficiently.A much more common cause of
occlusion is an intestinal parasite, which crawls in and is fastened.The common round-worm is the most frequent offender, and much less
often liver-flukes find a lodgment there.{1085} The ductus communis choledochus may be closed by agencies acting
from without.They are various, but the most common are the
carcinomata.Primary cancer of the gall-bladder and gall-ducts,
although not of frequent occurrence, is by no means rare.It develops
in connection with the connective-tissue new formations produced by the
inflammation following the migration of large calculi.A very
instructive example has been examined by the writer.The patient, a
woman aged forty-eight, had had numerous paroxysms of hepatic colic,
and after death, which followed a protracted stage of jaundice by
obstruction, a large ovoid calculus, filling the gall-bladder, was
found, and an extensive organized exudation of inflammatory origin was
the seat of carcinomatous disease involving the cystic and common ducts
and closing the lumen of both.Cancer of the pylorus, of the duodenum,
of the pancreas, of the right kidney, and of the liver itself, not
unfrequently by exterior pressure permanently occlude the common duct.To this category of obstructing causes must be added enlarged lymphatic
glands of the transverse fissure, large fecal accumulations, tumors of
the ovaries and uterus, aneurisms of the abdominal aorta, and
especially aneurism of the hepatic artery, several examples of which
have been reported, and one has occurred in a case seen by the writer.The effects of obstruction are much less important when the cystic duct
is closed.The contents of the gall-bladder accumulate, constituting
the condition known as dropsy of the gall-bladder.A catarrhal state of
the mucous membrane is set up; the muco-pus formed mixes with the bile,
and the mixture undergoes fermentative changes which further alter its
character and impart to it irritating qualities, in consequence of
which the mucous membrane becomes more decidedly inflamed, and a still
more purulent fluid forms, so that ultimately the contents of the
gall-bladder are entirely purulent, and that organ may attain to
enormous size.Instead of a catarrhal inflammation leading to
suppuration, the mucous membrane may pour out serum abundantly, the
biliary contents and mucus disappear by absorption, and finally the
gall-bladder will be moderately distended by a serous-like fluid.No
further disturbance ensues, and the gall-bladder, thus shut off from
participation in the hepatic functions, ceases to give trouble.The results are far different when the obstruction occurs in the
hepatic or common duct, for then the bile can no longer perform its
double function of secretion and excretion--of contributing materials
necessary to digestion and assimilation, and excreting substances whose
removal is necessary to health.The liver continuing to functionate
after closure of the duct is effected, obviously the secretion of bile
continues to accumulate, and the irritation of the mucous membrane
causes a catarrhal state; mucus is poured out, and serum escapes from
the distended vessels.If the hepatic duct only is obstructed, the
dilatation will not involve the cystic duct and gall-bladder, but as
the common duct at its termination is occluded, usually the whole
system of tubes will be affected by the ensuing changes.The
alterations already described as occurring in the gall-bladder take
place in all the hepatic ducts.The bile-elements are absorbed, and the
fluid distending the whole system of hepatic tubes becomes finally a
semi-transparent serum or a very thin sero-mucus, having in bulk a pale
sea-green color.Although an intense jaundice {1086} coexists with the
obstruction, no portion of the bile escapes into the ducts.At the
beginning of the obstruction more or less bile is in the tubes, and
then the fluid will have a distinct biliary character; but as it
accumulates, first the bile-constituents disappear, then the
mucus--which at the outset was formed freely--is absorbed, and at last
only a colorless serum remains.This fluid, which has been examined
chemically by Frerichs, is found to be slightly alkaline, to have only
2 per cent.of solids, and to present no trace of any biliary
constituent.As the fluid accumulates the gall-bladder and ducts
dilate, sometimes to an enormous extent, the fluid they contain
amounting to several pints.The walls of the ducts grow thinner, and
may finally give way with the pressure or from external violence, the
fluid exciting an intense and quickly-fatal peritonitis.Important
changes occur in the structure of the liver also.With the first
retention of bile the liver conspicuously enlarges, and may indeed
attain to twice its normal size, but it subsequently contracts, and may
lessen in as great a degree as it had enlarged.Changes begin in the
glandular structure as pressure is brought to bear on the cells by the
enlarging ducts.The liver-cells become anaemic and the protoplasm
cloudy, but granular and fatty degeneration does not take place.Even
more important as an agency affecting the condition of the hepatic
cells is the hyperplasia of the connective tissue, which ensues very
promptly when an obstruction to the flow of bile arises from any cause,
as has been shown by Legg[190] and Charcot.[191] The liver on section
has a rather dark olive-green color, and is firmer in texture, owing to
the increased development of the connective tissue; the cells are
bile-stained and contain granules of coloring matter and crystals of
bilirubin, and although they are at first not altered in outline,
subsequently more or less atrophy is produced by the contraction of the
newly-formed connective tissue and the pressure made by the dilated
hepatic ducts.[Footnote 190: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.352
_et seq._]

[Footnote 191: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.205 _et
seq._]

SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms produced by occlusion of the cystic duct are
not sufficiently characteristic to be diagnosticated with any
certainty.When an attack of hepatic colic has slowly subsided without
jaundice, and an elastic tumor, globular or pyriform in shape, has
appeared from under the inferior margin of the liver in the position of
the gall-bladder, dropsy of that organ may then be suspected.As
paracentesis of the gall-bladder may be performed with ease, safety,
and little pain, the diagnosis may be rendered more certain by the use
of the exploring-trocar.Obstruction of the hepatic or common duct is accompanied by symptoms of
a very pronounced and distinctly diagnostic character.Without
referring now to the antecedent symptoms or to those belonging to the
obstructing cause, the complexus of disturbances following the
obstruction is the subject to which our attention must be directed.The
great fact dominating all other considerations is the stoppage of the
bile, whether this has occurred suddenly or slowly.Jaundice begins in
a few hours after the canal is blocked.At first there is yellowness of
the conjunctiva, then diffused jaundice, deepening into the intensest
color in two or three weeks, or, when the obstruction is sudden and
complete, in a few hours.At first the color is the vivid jaundice
tint, a citron or salmon or yellow-saffron hue, but this gradually
loses its bright appearance, grows darker, and passes successively into
a brownish, bronze-like, and ultimately a {1087} dark olive-green,
which becomes the permanent color.Under some moral emotional
influences there may be a sudden change to a brighter tint, lasting a
few minutes, but otherwise the general dark olive-green hue persists
throughout.In a few instances, after some weeks of jaundice, the
abnormal coloration entirely disappears, signifying that the liver is
too much damaged in its proper glandular structure to be in a condition
to produce bile.Such a cessation of the jaundice is therefore of evil
omen.Pruritus, sometimes of a very intense character, accompanies the
jaundice, in most cases appears with it, and in the supposed curable
cases it has persisted after the cessation of the discoloration.The
irritation may become intolerable, destroying all comfort, rendering
sleep impossible, and so aggravating as to induce a highly nervous,
hysterical state.The scratching sets up an inflammation of the skin,
and presently a troublesome eczema is superadded.In some of the cases
a peculiar eruption occurs on the skin and mucous membranes, entitled
by Wilson[192] xanthelasma.It has been carefully studied by Wickham
Legg,[193] who has ascertained the character of the changes occurring
in the affected tissues, and also by Mr.[194] As a rule,
this eruption appears after several months of jaundice, and manifests
itself first on the eyelids, then on the palms of the hands, where it
makes the most characteristic exhibit, and after a time on the lips and
tongue.It occurs in irregular plaques of a yellowish tint slightly
elevated above the general surface, and rarely assumes a tubercular
form.As was shown by Hilton Fagge, xanthelasma occurs more especially
in the milder cases of catarrhal icterus that had been protracted in
duration, but it is also occasionally seen in the jaundice of
obstruction.[Footnote 192: _Diseases of the Skin_, 6th ed., Lond., p.[Footnote 193: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.317
_et seq._]

[Footnote 194: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.According to the stage of the disease during which the examination is
made the liver will be enlarged or contracted; more or less tenderness
may be developed by pressure in the area occupied by the ducts, and a
tumor in a position to effect compression may possibly be detected.The
area of hepatic dulness will be increased in the beginning of all the
cases in which the obstruction is complete, but will remain normal so
long as the flow of bile persists despite the obstruction.When
enlarged, the liver can be felt projecting below the inferior margin of
the ribs, and with it, in most cases, the elastic globular body, the
gall-bladder.The state of the hepatic secretion, and in consequence
the duration of the obstruction, may be ascertained by puncture of the
gall-bladder and withdrawal of some of its contents for examination.The presence of unaltered bile will indicate recent obstruction; of
serum, will prove long-standing interruption of bile-production.The
presence of concretions in the gall-bladder will indicate the character
of the obstructing cause, and an increased amount of bile of a normal
or nearly normal kind will be conclusive evidence that the obstruction
is in the course of the common duct.In a fatal case of permanent
occlusion examined by myself the cystic duct was closed by inflammatory
adhesions and the common duct was stopped up by a calculus.The enlarged area of hepatic dulness will, in a protracted case, not
continue.The proper secreting structure, the hepatic cells, undergo
atrophy, {1088} and the increased connective tissue--to the development
of which enlargement of the organ is mainly due--contracts.The
ultimate result is that the liver becomes sclerosed, and is distinctly
smaller, the area of hepatic dulness diminishing to a greater relative
extent than the area of dulness due to hypertrophic enlargement.The
contraction of the liver goes on at the rate that several months are
required to make the result evident on percussion and palpation.Not
unfrequently, the contraction is too slight to affect the percussion
note of the right hypochondrium, and then, to realize the condition of
the organ, the history and rational signs must be closely studied.Whilst the liver thus varies in size, the gall-bladder remains enlarged
and projects from the under surface of the organ, elastic, globular,
and distinctive.The shrinking of the liver from around it makes the
impression of growing size; it may be increasing, indeed, but more
frequently the enlargement is merely apparent.Whether the liver be enlarging or diminishing in size, its functions
are impaired, or indeed entirely suspended.As the digestive canal
receives the bile immediately on its production, it will be best to
begin with the gastro-intestinal disorders which accompany occlusion of
the bile-ducts.The appetite is either wanting entirely and food is
loathed, or an excessive or canine appetite is experienced.The latter
belongs rather to an early stage of the disorder, and comes on after
the first disturbance of the stomach belonging to the immediate effects
of the occlusion.The former is the result of long-standing
interference with the primary assimilation.The tongue is coated with a
thick yellowish fur, which, drying, is detached in flakes, leaving the
mucous membrane beneath red, raw, fissured, and easily bleeding.The
taste is bitter, and the mouth has a pasty, greasy, and unclean
feeling.There is much thirst, and as a rule the patient experiences a
keen desire for acid drinks and for fresh fruits.The stomach is rather
intolerant of food, and nausea comes on as soon as it enters the
stomach.The mucus and stomach-juice accumulating over night, in the
morning there is much retching and nausea until the acid and rather
foul contents of the organ come up.When food is retained it causes
much distress, gases of decomposition accumulate, distending the
stomach and giving prominence to the epigastrium, and eructations of
offensive gas, with some acid liquid, occur from time to time.Similarly, in the intestines the foods undergo decomposition instead of
normal digestion; gases of putrefaction are evolved, the abdomen
generally is swollen, and flatulent colic results.Very irritating fat
acids are liberated by the decomposition of the fatty constituents of
the food, which, with the acid products of the fermentation occurring
in the starch and sugar of the diet, cause a sensation of heat and
distress through the abdomen.Usually, the bowels are torpid, but in
some cases the stools are relaxed, having the consistence and
presenting somewhat the appearance of oatmeal porridge.They may be
firm, moulded, even hard.The gas discharged and the stools are
offensive, with a carrion-like odor.Sometimes decomposing articles of
food can be detected in the stools by very casual inspection--always,
indeed, when the examination is intimate.An excess of fat is also a
characteristic of the condition induced by occlusion of the ducts,
especially when the pancreatic duct is closed, as does happen in cancer
of the head of the pancreas.{1089} A significant change in the color of the stools takes place.They lose their normal brownish-red tint and become yellowish or
clay- or white, pasty, or grayish.Sometimes the stools are very
dark, tar-like in color and consistence, or more thin like prune-juice,
or in black scybalae.The most usual appearance of the stools in
occlusion is grayish, mush-like, and coarsely granular.The very dark
hue assumed at times or in some cases signifies the presence of blood.A dark tint of the evacuations may be caused by articles of food, as a
greenish hue may be due to the use of spinach; a clay- tint to
the almost exclusive use of milk; a grayish tint to the action of
bismuth; a bilious appearance to the action of rhubarb; and many
others.When the occlusion is partial, although it be permanent,
sufficient bile may descend into the duodenum to color the stools to
the normal tint, and yet all the other signs of obstruction be present.The bile-pigment, not having an outlet by the natural route, by the
intestine, passes into the blood; all the tissues of the body and the
various secretions and excretions, notably the urine, are stained by
it, constituting the appearance known as jaundice or icterus.This
malady has been described (see ante), but it is necessary now to give a
more specialized account of those conditions due more especially to the
prolonged obstruction of the biliary flow.These are a morbid state of
the blood; changes in the kidneys and in the composition of the urine;
a peculiar form of fever known as hepatic intermittent fever; and a
group of nervous symptoms to which has been applied the term cholaemia.It has already been shown that but little pressure is required to
divert the flow of bile from the ducts backward into the blood.Changes
consequently ensue in the constitution of the blood and in the action
of the heart and of the vessels.The bile acids lower the heart's
movements and lessen the arterial tension; hence the pulse is slower,
softer, and feebler than the normal.Should fever arise, this
depressing action of the bile acids is maintained; and hence, although
the temperature becomes elevated, the pulse-rate does not increase
correspondingly.There are exceptions to this, however, in so far that
the heart and arteries are in some instances little affected, but it is
probable under these circumstances that there are conditions present
which induce decomposition of the bile acids.The most important result of the action of the bile on the constitution
of the blood is the hemorrhagic diathesis.Soon after the occlusion
occurs in very young subjects--at a later period in adults--the
occlusion having existed for many months, in some cases only near the
end, the disposition to hemorrhagic extravasations and to hemorrhages
manifests itself.From the surface of the mucous membranes, under the
serous, in the substance of muscles, the hemorrhages occur.Epistaxis,
or nasal hemorrhage, is usually the first to appear, and may be the
most difficult to arrest.The gums transude blood, and wherever
pressure is brought to bear on the integument ecchymoses follow.The
conjunctiva may be disfigured and the eyelids swollen and blackened by
extravasations, and the skin of the cheeks and nose marked by stigmata.Haematemesis sometimes occurs, but the extravasations into the
intestinal canal more frequently--indeed, very constantly--take place
in a gradual manner, and impart to the stools a dark, almost black,
tar-like appearance.In the same way the urine may contain fluid blood
and coagula, or it may have a merely smoky {1090} appearance from
intimate admixture with the blood at the moment of secretion.Both the bile-pigment and bile acids exert an injurious action on the
kidneys.In cases of prolonged obstruction not only are the tissues of
the organ stained by pigment in common with the tissues of the body,
but the epithelium of the tubules, of the straight and convoluted
tubes, are, according to Moebius,[195] infiltrated with pigment.In
consequence of the size and number of the masses of pigment, the tubes
may become obstructed and the secretion of urine much diminished.Other
changes occur, due chiefly to the action of the bile acids, according
to the same authority.These alterations consist in parenchymatous
degeneration.The urine contains traces of albumen in most cases, and,
according to Nothnagel,[196] always casts of the hyaline and granular
varieties stained with pigment.As the alterations in the structure of
the kidneys progress, fatty epithelium is cast off, and thus the
tubules come finally to be much obstructed and the function of the
organ seriously impaired.To cholaemia then are superadded the peculiar
disturbances belonging to retention of the urinary constituents.[Footnote 195: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, vol.[Footnote 196: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.326;
also, Harley, _op.One of the most interesting complications which arises during the
existence of obstruction of the bile-ducts is the form of fever
entitled by Charcot[197] intermittent hepatic fever.Although its
character was first indicated by Monneret,[198] we owe the present
conception of its nature and its more accurate clinical history to
Charcot.As has already been pointed
out, the passage of a gall-stone may develop a latent malarial
infection or a febrile movement comparable to that caused by the
passage of a catheter, and known as urethral fever.Charcot supposes
that true intermittent hepatic fever is septicaemic in character, and
can therefore arise only in those cases accompanied by an angiocholitis
of the suppurative variety--such, for example, as that which follows
the passage of calculi.Illustrative cases of this fever, one of them
confirmed by an autopsy, have been recently reported by E. Wagner,[199]
who is rather inclined to accept Charcot's view of the pathogeny.A
remarkable case has been published by Regnard,[200] in which the
angiocholitis was induced by the extension of echinococcus cysts into
the common duct.Whilst there are some objections to Charcot's theory,
on the whole it is probably true that this intermittent hepatic fever
is produced by the absorption from the inflamed surface of the ducts of
a noxious material there produced.It may be likened to the fever which
can be caused by the injection of putrid pus into the veins of animals.[Footnote 197: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.178 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 198: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 199: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.[Footnote 200: _Gazette med.49, 1873, quoted by Wagner,
_supra_.]Intermittent hepatic fever, as its name implies, is a paroxysmal fever,
having a striking resemblance to malarial fever, but differs from it in
less regularity of recurrence, in the fact that urea is below the
normal amount instead of increased, and in the effect of quinine, which
in the case of malarial fever is curative, but not curative in hepatic
fever.The paroxysms are sometimes quotidian, rarely double quotidian,
tertian, quartan, and even longer, and in the same case all of these
varieties may occur; on {1091} the other hand, there may be entire
regularity of the seizures.The severity of the chill, the maximum
temperature, and the amount of sweating vary within considerable
limits; there may be merely a slight sense of chilliness or a severe
rigor; the temperature may rise to 101 degrees or to 104 degrees F.,
and there may be a gentle moisture or a profuse sweat.There does not
seem to be any relation between the extent and severity of the local
mischief and the systemic condition.The period of onset of intermittent hepatic fever, and its duration and
mode of termination, are by no means readily determined.Cyr fixes on
the paroxysms of colic as the beginning, but he obviously confounds the
chill and fever caused by the passage of a calculus with the true
intermittent hepatic fever.In a carefully-observed case, the facts
confirmed by an autopsy, E. Wagner[201] gives the clinical history of a
typical example of this malady: Gall-stones were found in the duodenum,
in the common and cystic ducts, but the most important one was a
polyangular stone obstructing the hepatic duct.There was an ulcer with
thickened margin at the entrance to the gall-bladder, and the mucous
membrane of the common duct near the intestinal orifice had a smooth,
cicatricial aspect of recent origin, indicating inflammatory
ulceration.The conditions favorable to the production of a morbid
material of a kind to induce septicaemic fever were therefore present.The onset of fever occurred ten days after the last seizure, time being
thus afforded for the local changes necessary.The duration of the
fever in this case was five months, but the existence of pulmonary
phthisis with cavities will explain this apparently protracted hepatic
intermittent fever.The duration of the disease in its usual form is
uncertain, and ranges between a week and two months, or even three
months, according to Charcot.[202]

[Footnote 201: _Deutsches Archiv fur klinische Medicin_, Band xxxiv.[Footnote 202: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, p.Suspension of work by the liver necessarily involves retention in the
blood of various excrementitious matters.The attempt of Flint[203] to
establish the doctrine of cholesteraemia has not been supported by the
evidence of contemporary or subsequent physiologists.This theory
denies to the other constituents of the bile any morbific action, and
concentrates those disturbances known as cholaemia on the effects of
cholesterin.As uraemia signifies not merely the presence of urea in
the blood, but of all of the toxic substances excreted by the kidneys,
so the word cholaemia comprehends all the constituents of bile having
power to derange the organism by their presence in the blood.[Footnote 203: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, 1862, p.349 _et seq._]

By cholaemia is meant those disturbances, chiefly nervous, which are
due to the presence of biliary excrementitious matters in the blood,
and not less to the effect on nutrition of the absence of bile from the
process of digestion in the intestine.As the atrophic changes proceed
in the liver, the quantity of urea and uric acid in the urine
diminishes, and presently leucin and tyrosin appear.Amongst the means
of differential diagnosis of hepatic intermittent fever from malarial
fever Charcot mentions the quantity of urea present--in the former
greatly lessened, in the latter much increased.There is, however, a
source of fallacy here not mentioned by Charcot: that is, the
variations in the amount of urea due to destruction of the hepatic
secreting structure.It follows that as changes {1092} occur in the
kidneys, to the condition of cholaemia is superadded the derangements
belonging to uraemia.When the occlusion has existed for some time--a variable period, partly
due to peculiarities of individual structure--there come on certain
characteristic symptoms of nervous origin: headache, hebetude of mind,
dull hearing, obscure or hazy vision, xanthopsia; somnolence and
greatly increasing stupor, leading into coma; rambling and incoherence
of mind, passing into delirium; muscular twitching, subsultus; muscular
weakness, deepening into paralysis; and finally, it may be, general
convulsions.As these derangements of the nervous system develop, a
light febrile movement supervenes, so that the whole complexus has the
typhoid type, or, as it can be more definitely expressed, the patient
thus affected lapses into the typhoid state.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Occlusion of the gall-ducts is an
essentially chronic malady in the greatest number of cases.As a rule,
the causes of obstruction operate slowly, but to this rule there are
exceptions.Permanent occlusion may take place suddenly, as when a
gall-stone is impacted immovably in the common duct, or when a
round-worm makes its way into the duct and is firmly fixed there,
incapable of further movement.When occlusion is once effected the gradual changes occurring in the
liver lead to slow decline of the nutrition; the bile-elements
circulating in the blood poison it and set up alterations in the
structure of the kidney, and ultimately, the brain becoming affected,
the end is reached by convulsions and coma.Although permanent
occlusion, if unrelieved, terminates in death, a small proportion of
cases get well, either in consequence of giving way of the obstructing
cause or from the opening of a new route to the intestine.Thus, a
calculus lodged in the fossa of Vater may suffer such injury to its
outer shell as to yield to the action of solvents, or, suppuration
occurring around it, the stone may be loosened and forced onward, or
ulceration may open a channel into the bowel.An incurable malady
causing the occlusion, the termination in death is only a question of
time.There are several
factors, however, whose value can be approximately estimated.When the
obstructing cause is merely local--as, for example, a gall-stone or the
cicatrix of a simple ulcer--the duration of the case is determined by
the mere effect of the suspension of the hepatic functions.As the
eliminating action of the liver and the part played by the bile in the
intestinal digestion are necessary to life, it follows that the
complete cessation of these functions must lead to death.The rate at
which decline takes place under these circumstances varies somewhat in
different subjects.Probably two years may be regarded as the maximum,
and three months the minimum, period at which death ensues when no
other pathogenetic factor intervenes.DIAGNOSIS.--To determine the fact of occlusion is by no means
difficult: the persistent jaundice, the absence of bile in the stools,
and the appearance of the bile-elements in the urine are sufficient.It
is far different when the cause of the occlusion is to be ascertained.The ease and safety with which the exploring-trocar can be used in
cases of supposed obstruction of the cystic duct enable the physician
to decide with confidence points which before could only be matters of
mere {1093} conjecture.The writer of these lines was the first to
puncture the gall-bladder and to explore, by means of a flexible probe
passed through the canula, the course of the duct.[204] It is possible
in this way to ascertain the existence of gall-stones in the
gall-bladder, to find an obstruction at the entrance of the cystic
duct, to demonstrate the presence of echinococci cysts, and to remove
for microscopical examination pathological fluids of various kinds.More recently, Whittaker and Ransohoff[205] of Cincinnati have
attempted the detection of a gall-stone impacted at any point by the
introduction of an exploring-needle; and this practice has been
imitated by Harley[206] of London, but without any reference to the
pioneer and prior investigation of his American colleagues.The case of
Whittaker and Ransohoff survived the exploratory puncture, but Harley's
case proved fatal from traumatic peritonitis.Notwithstanding this
untoward result, Harley persists in the advocacy of this method.It
must appear to any one familiar with the intricate arrangement of the
parts composing the anatomy of this region a most hazardous proceeding,
and hardly to be justified in view of the superior safety and certainty
of my method.To explore the interior of the gall-bladder an
aspirator-trocar is introduced; any fluid intended for microscopical
examination is then withdrawn, and through the canula a flexible
whalebone bougie is passed.[Footnote 204: _The Cincinnati Lancet and Clinic_ for 1878-79; also, W.
W. Keen, M.D., "On Cholecystotomy," _The Medical News_, Sept., 1884.][Footnote 205: _Lancet and Clinic_, 1884.][Footnote 206: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1884.]When icterus comes on in a few days after birth and persists until
death ensues by convulsions and coma, there can be no doubt regarding
congenital absence or impermeability of the common duct.Permanent
retention-jaundice, accompanied by the characteristic symptoms of that
condition immediately succeeding an attack of hepatic colic, is
probably due to impaction by a calculus.When, at or after middle life,
in a patient with a history of former attacks due to gall-stones, there
begins a fixed pain in the right hypochondrium, and subsequently
retention-jaundice, the existence of a malignant growth in connection
with the cicatricial tissue and ancient organized exudation should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if subsequently a tumor
can be felt.If with a localized pain slowly-developing jaundice,
intestinal indigestion, fats and oils appearing unchanged in the
stools, and a condition of prostration more than is properly referable
to the derangement of the hepatic functions, come on in a man or woman
after thirty-five, cancer of the head of the pancreas should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if a tumor can be
detected in that situation.It should not be forgotten, however, that
in emaciated subjects the head of the pancreas may be so prominent as
to be mistaken for a scirrhous growth.A pulsating tumor of the right hypochondrium, accompanied by jaundice,
may be an aneurism of the hepatic artery.Pulsation may be communicated
to a bunch of enlarged portal lymphatic glands, which will compress the
common duct, but in this case, as the increase in the size of the
glands is due to caseous, amyloid, or cancerous deposits, there will be
found a source whence these morbid products are derived, and will
explain the nature of a tumor thus constituted.The differentiation of hypertrophic cirrhosis from occlusion of a
slowly-forming character is by no means easy.In both jaundice {1094}
gradually appears; in both the liver is enlarged, but in hypertrophic
cirrhosis much more than in occlusion; and in the latter the
gall-bladder is full--may indeed be distended--whilst in the former it
is empty or contains but little bile.The history of the case may
indicate the nature of the symptoms.Previous attacks of hepatic colic,
and the symptoms of occlusion supervening on the last, are highly
significant of calculous occlusion.TREATMENT.--To ascertain the nature of the occlusion is a necessary
preliminary to any exact treatment.In many cases this must remain a
mere conjecture, when, of course, the treatment is only symptomatic.When it is probable or certain that the duct is obstructed by a
calculus, two methods may be resorted to for its removal: one method is
to break up the calculus by mechanical means; the other is to effect
its solution by chemical agents.Fracture of an impacted calculus is not a merely fanciful expedient.If
the site of the obstruction is ascertained, an attempt may be made to
penetrate the calculus by an aspirator-needle passed through the
abdominal walls, according to the method of Whittaker and Ransohoff.The dangers attendant on this mere puncture are great, and a fatal
result has occurred in one of the very few cases in which it has been
done.Less severe and dangerous methods for attempting the
disintegration of a calculus should be first tried, as follows: Make
firm friction with the fingers along the inferior margin of the ribs
and toward the epigastrium and umbilicus, whilst the opposite side
posteriorly is supported by the hand spread out and applied firmly.A
strong faradic current sent through the region of the gall-bladder and
ducts has in several instances seemed to do good--indeed, to remove
obstructions.A calculus impacted may be dislodged either by the
fracture of its surfaces or by the strong muscular contractions of the
abdominal walls and of the muscular layer of the duct.Most calculi are
easily broken, and when the smallest breach is made in the external
crust disintegration follows; and some calculi are so friable as to
yield to slight pressure.Furthermore, the slightest solution in the
continuity of the rind disposes the whole mass to dissolve in suitable
menstrua.Mechanical rupture is so important a step in the process of
disintegration of an impacted calculus that so serious an operation as
section of the abdomen as a preliminary to it should be considered.The
cavity exposed, the obstructed duct is found, and its retained calculus
is mashed without section of the duct.I find one instance[207] in
which this was done as a subordinate part of a cholecystotomy, and the
breaking up of the stone proved to be easy of accomplishment.It is
also the method of Tait, who proposes to mash the calculus by means of
suitable forceps fitted with padded blades.[Footnote 207: Harley's case, _op.cit._]

I have suggested a means of effecting solution of an impacted calculus
which seems, on further reflection, well worthy of consideration.The
proposal is to inject, through a canula introduced into the
gall-bladder, one of the solvents of the cholesterin calculus before
mentioned.I have already used the canula as a duct for the passage of
an exploring-sound, and have by means of it explored the interior of
the gall-bladder.It is quite as feasible to inject through the canula
a solvent, successive charges of which can be thrown in and withdrawn
by the aspirator.{1095} That the usual solvents introduced by the stomach can effect the
solution of impacted calculi has been declared impossible by
Trousseau;[208] and with this conclusion I unhesitatingly agree.I have
already discussed this part of the subject, and need now only refer the
reader to that section.[Footnote 208: _Clinique medicale_, _loc.cit._]

The various causes of obstruction besides calculi do not offer an
inviting field for the exercise of therapeutical skill.Each case must
be treated according to the nature of the obstructing cause; hence to
make an accurate diagnosis is an essential preliminary to suitable
treatment.DISEASES OF THE PORTAL VEIN.Thrombosis and Embolism of the Portal Vein; Stenosis; Pylephlebitis.DEFINITION.--By the terms at the head of this section are meant the
various pathological processes which induce coagulation of the blood in
some part of the portal system.As the portal vein is made up of many
branches coming from the various organs of the abdominal cavity except
the kidneys, and as it empties, so to speak, into the liver, it is
obvious that various and complex derangements will ensue on the
formation of thrombi.CAUSES.--Thrombosis of the portal vein occurs under three general
conditions: the blood is in a readily coagulable state; the action of
the heart is weak and the blood-current sluggish; the circulation
through the vein is impeded by external pressure.The coagulability of
the blood is increased in diseases characterized by an excess of its
fibrin-producing constituents, of which cirrhosis of the liver may be
mentioned as one having this peculiarity.In chronic maladies of a
depressing kind there may be simply a weak action of the heart, or the
muscular tissue of the organ may be affected by a fatty and atrophic
degeneration.The external pressure by which the blood-current through
the vein is impeded may be caused by the newly-formed connective tissue
of Glisson's capsule, by enlarged lymphatics in the hilus of the liver,
or by tumors of various kinds.The first named of these causes of
compression--atrophic cirrhosis--is most frequently acting.Very
rarely, organized exudations of the peritoneum may be so situated as to
compress the portal vein.This result can only happen when the hepatic
portion of the peritoneum is involved.Pylephlebitis exists in two forms: the adhesive and suppurative.The
former results in changes not unlike those of simple thrombosis.The
blood coagulates in the affected part of the vessel, the clot is
organized, and the vessel ultimately forms a solid rounded cord which
is permanently occluded.The suppurative variety is so different in its
origin and in its results that it requires separate treatment, and I
therefore postpone the consideration of it to the next section.{1096} SYMPTOMS OF THROMBOSIS AND ADHESIVE PYLEPHLEBITIS.--It is a
remarkable fact that the biliary function of the liver is not
necessarily affected in cases of occlusion of the portal vein.It is
true, in advanced cases of cirrhosis, when the interlobular veins are
obliterated by the pressure of the contracting newly-formed connective
tissue, the functions of the liver are arrested in so far as the damage
thus caused extends.Notwithstanding the blocking of the portal,
sufficient blood reaches the hepatic cells by the anastomosis between
the hepatic artery and the interlobular veins--an anatomical connection
demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten.[209] So long as this anastomosis
continues bile will be formed, although the portal vein is occluded.[Footnote 209: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxvii.153, "Ueber
Circulationsstorungen in der Leber."]The most significant symptoms of thrombosis of the portal vein are the
sudden formation of ascites, which quickly assumes a very high grade,
and equally sudden passive congestion of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, enlargement of the spleen, and distension of the superficial
veins of the abdominal parietes.When these symptoms succeed to
cirrhosis of the liver, or appear after the formation of a tumor in the
hepatic region, or come on in the course of phthisis or chronic
inflammation of the hepatic peritoneum, the existence of thrombus of
the portal vein may be reasonably suspected.Coincidently with the occlusion of the portal vein the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane becomes the seat of a catarrhal
process, and to the fluid thus produced is added a much more abundant
transudation from the distended capillaries.Nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea result, the rejected matters being serous, watery, and in
many cases tinged with blood.Now and then quite a severe hemorrhage
takes place, and the blood is brought up by vomiting (haematemesis) or
is discharged by stool.Hemorrhoids form, and, in large masses
protruding, much pain is experienced, and free bleeding may result from
rupture of a distended vein.The veins of the abdominal parietes, which in the normal state are
invisible or at least not prominent, and which form anastomoses with
the portal, when the obstruction occurs dilate, sometimes to a
remarkable extent.The most important anastomosis is that between the
femoral and saphena and internal mammary and epigastric veins.When the
hepatic branches of the portal are closed, but the trunk remains
pervious, the parumbilical vein enlarges greatly, and, communicating
with the superficial veins of the anterior part of the abdominal walls,
forms a radiating network of tortuous veins to which is given the
striking title of caput Medusae.The most significant symptom of portal thrombosis is a quickly-forming
ascites.It is true, ascites is a common symptom in advanced cirrhosis,
but the rapid accumulation of fluid and the prompt filling of the
cavity after tapping distinguish that which arises from portal
thrombosis from all others.Besides its excessive extent, the ascites
presents the usual symptoms.Due to the same cause as the enlargement of the superficial veins, the
hemorrhages, the ascites, etc., there occurs considerable hypertrophy
of the spleen in many of the cases.It sometimes happens that the new
compensatory circulation and the hemorrhages from some part in the
{1097} usual route of the portal so dispose of the blood that the
spleen does not enlarge sufficiently to be readily made out.COURSE AND TERMINATION.--It is obvious that a condition such as that
induced by thrombosis of the portal must be comparatively quickly
fatal; but the cases vary in duration as the compensatory circulation
is more or less complete.Whilst the majority of cases terminate within
two weeks, instances of several months' duration are not unknown, but a
fatal termination, sooner or later, is inevitable in all cases.Coming on in the course of some chronic affection of the liver or some
obstructing cause exterior to the organ, there soon follow ascites,
nausea and vomiting, haematemesis, bloody stools of a liquid character,
enlargement of the spleen, distension of the abdominal veins, and the
distressing symptoms produced by an excessive accumulation of fluid in
the peritoneal cavity.DIAGNOSIS.--As there is no symptom of thrombosis of the portal which
may not be caused by advanced cirrhosis, the diagnosis rests on the
rapid production of the attendant phenomena and their conjoint
appearance.TREATMENT.--A symptomatic treatment is alone possible.The highly
irritable and congested intestinal mucous membrane precludes the
employment of hydragogue cathartics.Salines which cause outward
diffusion from the vessels are the only cathartics which can be used
with propriety.Action of the kidneys and of the skin must be
maintained.To this end the resin of copaiba in pilular form and
pilocarpine subcutaneously may be used.If the strength of the patient
will permit, leeches around the anus can be applied, and much relief
may be expected from free bleeding.It is probable that opening a
swollen hemorrhoid would give the same kind of relief as that caused by
a free hemorrhage.In any case the benefit derived from treatment must
be merely palliative and temporary.Suppurative Pylephlebitis.PATHOGENY.--Primary pylephlebitis rarely if ever occurs.On the other
hand, the secondary form is by no means uncommon; it succeeds to
ulcerative or purulent inflammation at some point in the circuit of
origin of the portal radicles.The most frequently-occurring cause is
ulceration and suppuration of some part of the intestinal tube, and
hence the most common result is multiple abscess of the liver.Pylephlebitis has often resulted from typhlitis; from ulcers of the
large intestine, as in dysentery; from such traumatic injuries as tying
hemorrhoids; from proctitis; from ulcers of the stomach and similar
morbid processes elsewhere within the range of origin of the portal
system.The inflammatory or ulcerative action
extends to and involves the walls of the veins, or some morbid material
diffuses through the vein walls.In either case coagulation of the
blood in the vessel ensues, and the clot undergoes a series of changes
resulting in the formation of emboli, which, carried into the main
current, are subsequently lodged in the hepatic capillaries.There are three steps in the morbid process: the changes in the vein
wall; the production and transformation of the thrombus; and the
formation of secondary suppurating foci in the liver.{1098} The appearance of the tunics of the inflamed vessels varies with
the stage at which they are examined.At first the walls of the vessels
are reddish from congestion, succulent, and swollen, infiltrated by
leucocytes and inflammatory exudation and the cellular elements
undergoing proliferation.The intima especially is much altered in its
appearance and structure, becoming thick, opaque, grayish or yellowish
in color, and having adherent to it a thrombus passing through its
characteristic changes.Ulceration of the intima then occurs, and the
purulent elements, with shreds of tissue, mingle with the degenerating
blood-clot, and ultimately there remains a purulent depot lined with
sloughing, even gangrenous, contents.Emboli detached from such
decomposing thrombus are arrested in the vessels of the liver, and
there set up a suppurating phlebitis, ending in an abscess formation,
or a quantity of pus from the original point of ulcerative phlebitis
passes into the portal vein, and is generally distributed through the
hepatic branches, here and there foci of suppuration being established
by the deposit of decomposing emboli.There may be numerous small
abscesses irregularly distributed through the liver, or there may be
one or two larger collections of pus.Very often the vessel whose
occlusion by a suppurating embolus has caused the mischief is
destroyed, and hence no communication with the abscess-cavity can then
be traced.These abscesses are not limited by a line of inflammatory
demarcation or by a limiting membrane, but the hepatic tissue adjacent
is congested and infiltrated with pus.Ulceration, abscesses, or purulent inflammation occurring at any point
within the area of origin of the radicles of the portal vein may induce
pylephlebitis and consequent hepatic abscess.There are two points at
which, suppuration established, secondary pylephlebitis is most apt to
occur: the caecum; the rectum.As respects the former, the symptoms of
typhlitis precede the hepatic disturbance; and as respects the latter,
usually dysentery, or rather proctitis, is the initial disease.In both
sources of the hepatic trouble the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
chiefly concerned--a fact explicable by reference to the sluggishness
of the circulation and the distended condition of these veins, whence
it is that thrombus is very readily induced.Numerous instances of
pylephlebitis following suppurative lesions of the caecum have been
reported.One of the most recent, and at the same time typical,
examples of such conditions is that published by Bradbury[210] of
Cambridge, England.The initial lesion was "an ulcer the size of a
split pea" situated near "the junction of the vermiform appendix and
caecum.""The hemorrhoidal veins and the inferior mesenteric above were
filled with breaking-down clot and pus," and "the liver contained many
abscesses of various sizes, the largest about the size of a lemon,
which had burst through the diaphragm."As is so often the case, the
ulcer of the caecum produced no recognizable disturbance, and important
symptoms were manifest only when the emboli lodged in the liver set up
suppuration, when there occurred the usual signs of hepatic abscess.In
the West and South hepatic abscess due to pylephlebitis, induced by
proctitis, with ulceration of the rectum, is a common incident.Various
examples of this kind have fallen under my own observation.The
relatively greater frequency of this form of pylephlebitis is due to
the fact above {1099} stated, that the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
voluminous, have a sluggish current, and are liable to over-distension
by pressure of feces and by external abdominal bands and clothing.Cases of a corresponding character arise from suppuration and
ulceration elsewhere within the portal circuit.Thus, Bristowe[211]
reports a case in which pylephlebitis resulted from an ulcer of the
stomach, the neighboring veins becoming implicated and the usual
results following.[Footnote 210: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, Sept.450,
"Proceedings of the Cambridge Medical Society."][Footnote 211: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of London_,
vol.When inflammation has begun in a radicle of the portal vein, it may
proceed to the liver by contiguity of tissue, the whole intervening
portion of the vessel being affected.Probably more frequently the
intra-hepatic portion of the portal is inflamed by emboli, and the
adjacent hepatic tissue then undergoes suppuration, as has been already
set forth.SYMPTOMS.--There being two points of disease--the primary lesion of the
peripheral vessel and the secondary results in the hepatic portion of
the portal--the symptomatology must have a corresponding expression.The stomach, the caecum, or the rectum, or some other organ or tissue,
being occupied by a morbid process, there will be a characteristic
complex of symptoms.Taking up the most usual primary disturbance, a
typhlitis or an ulcer of the caecum, there will be pain, tenderness,
and possibly fever, occupying in point of time the period proper to
such a malady and an amount of disturbance of function determined by
the extent of the lesion.The symptoms caused by a single small ulcer
of the caecum, as in the example narrated by Bradbury, may present no
characteristic features and may have little apparent importance, and
yet the lesion is productive of very grave consequences.When from any of the causes mentioned above a thrombus forms in a vein
of the portal system in consequence of the extension of the
inflammation about it, the case, what importance soever it previously
had, now takes on new characters.The onset of the inflammation of the
vein walls and the puriform degeneration of the thrombus is announced
by a chill--a severe rigor, or chilly sensations at least.At the time
of the chill, and sometimes before it, pain is felt, significant of the
lesion in the vein.When proctitis or typhlitis precedes the
pylephlebitis, pain appropriate to the malady is a significant symptom;
but the pain which comes on with the beginning of the inflammation in
the liver is a new sign.The most frequent sites of the pain are the
right hypochondrium and the epigastrium, but it may also be felt in the
left hypochondrium or in either iliac fossa.Unless there be diffuse
peritonitis the pain is accompanied by a strictly-localized tenderness
to pressure.The situation of the pain may afford an indication of the
vein attacked, and when there are two points at which pain is
experienced, one may originate at the first situation of the morbid
action; the other will be due to pylephlebitis.The fever succeeding the chill is decided, and in some cases may attain
to extraordinary height--a manifestation indicative of the pyaemic
character of the affection.The fever intermits or remits, with a more
or less profuse perspiration.The febrile phenomena are similar in
their objective expression to malarial fever, but there is an important
difference in respect to the periods of recurrence of the chills.The
paroxysms are very irregular as to time: there may a daily seizure at
different hours, or there may be several chills on the same day.In
other words, the {1100} paroxysms have the pyaemic characteristics
rather than the malarial.After a time the intermittent phenomenon
ceases, and there occurs a remission merely, the exacerbation being
preceded by chilliness and succeeded by sweating.The sweats are
characteristically profuse and exhausting.During the sweating the
temperature begins to decline, and reaches its lowest point just before
the chilly sensations during the early morning announce the onset of
the daily exacerbation of the afternoon and evening.The thermal line
exhibits many irregularities until the febrile movement assumes the
remittent type, when there occur the morning remission and nocturnal
exacerbation.The maxima may be from 103 degrees F. to 105 degrees,
even to 106 degrees.When the pain and chill come on, disturbances of the digestive organs
ensue.When a large vein of the portal system is occluded, the
remaining veins must be over-distended, and congestion of a part or of
all of the digestive tract will be a result.An acute gastric catarrh
is set up.The appetite is lost, the stomach becomes irritable, and
vomiting is a usual incident.Sometimes the disgust for food is
extreme, and the nausea and vomiting are almost incessant.The vomited
matters consist of a watery mucus mixed with thin bile after a time,
and now and then of a bloody mucus.Thrombosis of a stomach vein may
occur, to be followed by an acute ulcer, and from this considerable
hemorrhage may proceed, when the vomit will consist of blood.Such an
accident, happening to the mucous membrane of the intestine, will be
indicated by bloody stools if the ulceration is low down, or by
brownish, blackish, or chocolate- stools if higher up in the
small bowel.The tongue has usually a characteristic coating in these cases.Large
patches of a rather heavy and darkish fur form, and, cast off from time
to time, leave a glazed and somewhat raw surface.Sometimes there is a
profuse salivary flow, but more frequently the mouth is dry.The lips
are fissured or contain patches of herpes, and the buccal cavity may be
more or less completely lined by patches of aphthae.Diarrhoea is a usual symptom, the stools being dark when mixed with
blood, or grayish and pasty or clay- when there is jaundice.Three-fourths of the cases of pylephlebitis are free from jaundice.This symptom may occur at the onset when the common duct is obstructed
by a calculus, but in other cases it appears when the formation of pus
in the liver exerts sufficient compression of the hepatic ducts to
prevent the passage of the bile.When jaundice occurs, it is accompanied by the usual symptoms.The
urine, previously unchanged, is now  by bile-pigment, and the
alterations in the renal structure and function belonging to jaundice
also take place.It sometimes happens that the obstruction of the portal vein is
sufficient to cause enlargement of the superficial veins of the
abdomen, but the duration of the disease is usually too brief to permit
much deviation from the normal, except rarely.In the cases
characterized by the occurrence of diffuse peritonitis the abdomen will
present a swollen and tense appearance, and there will be acute
tenderness to pressure.The area of hepatic and splenic dulness is not
increased from the outset, but is evident, as respects the spleen, soon
after the obstruction at the liver, and as respects the liver when the
formation of abscesses occurs.{1101} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of pylephlebitis
is compounded of the disturbance at the original point of disease, and
of the secondary inflammation at the several points in the liver where
emboli set up purulent inflammation.There are, therefore, two distinct
symptom-groups, and a short intervening period in which the first is
being merged into the second.The duration is variable, but the extreme
limits are not remote from each other, the condition of pylephlebitis
terminating in from two weeks to three months, the shorter being the
more usual.The termination is death, doubtless invariably; for, as in
true pyaemia arising from other causes, the septic changes in the blood
are such as to preclude the possibility of a return to the normal
condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The main point in the diagnosis consists in the occurrence
of an evident local inflammation, followed by the signs of suppuration
in the hepatic region coming on subsequent to ulceration and
suppuration at some point in the peripheral expansion of the portal
system.Thus, when a proctitis with ulceration of the rectum has been
in existence for some time, there occur pain and tenderness in the
hepatic region, accompanied by an irregularly intermittent fever and by
profuse sweating, it can be assumed with considerable certainty that
emboli have been deposited in some one or more of the terminal branches
of the portal.The evidences of hepatic trouble--swelling of the organ,
jaundice, etc.--and of portal obstruction, which then supervene,
indicate with some precision the nature of the case.TREATMENT.--Although pylephlebitis wears a most unfavorable aspect, the
possibility of a favorable result should always be entertained by the
therapeutist.As absorption of medicaments must be slow--indeed, uncertain--by the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane when there is portal occlusion, it is
well to attempt treatment by the skin and subcutaneous connective
tissue.Gastro-intestinal disturbance--nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea--should be treated by a combination of bismuth, creasote, and
glycerin--remedies acting locally chiefly.Ammonia--the carbonate and
solution of the acetate--is indicated, and should be given for the
purpose of dissolving thrombi and emboli.Corrosive sublimate, carbolic
acid, and quinine can be administered by the subcutaneous areolar
tissue.Quinine may also be introduced by friction with lard, and in
considerable quantity.V. PARASITES OF THE LIVER.Echinococcus of the Liver; Hydatids of the Liver.DEFINITION.--The echinococcus is the intermediate or larval stage in
the development of the Taenia echinococcus--the completed
parasite--whose chief habitat is the intestine of the dog.As the
natural and clinical history of parasites is elsewhere treated of, the
subject is here confined to the development of echinococci cysts in the
liver, its ducts, and vessels.CAUSES.--The presence of echinococcus vesicles in the liver is due to
{1102} the migration of the embryo from the intestinal canal.As
Davaine[212] has ascertained by analysis of all the recorded examples
previous to the publication of his treatise, echinococci are found in
as large a proportion in the liver as in all the other organs combined.This statement is repeated with approval by Cobbold[213] and by
Heller.[214] The embryo, set free in the intestine from the food or
drink containing the ova, starts on its migration.There are several
reasons why the liver is selected for its habitat: it is the largest
accessible organ; the common duct and the portal vein offer the most
convenient roadway for reaching and penetrating its substance.The
exact route or routes of which the parasite avails itself in migrating
have not been definitely settled, although Friedreich has shown that
the portal vein is the medium of transmission of the Echinococcus
multilocularis.The comparative frequency with which the liver is
entered indicates that the portal vein is the favorite route of
migration.[Footnote 212: _Traite des Entozoaires et des Maladies vermineuses,
etc._, par C. Davaine, Paris, 1877, p.[Footnote 213: _Entozoa_, by T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S., London,
1874, p.iii of _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.PATHOLOGY AND SYMPTOMS.--The number of echinococci reaching the liver
varies from one to ten or twelve or more.They increase in size from
the time of their deposit in the organ, and ultimately attain to large
proportions.The rapidity of growth depends somewhat on the character
of the tissue in which imbedded, and the amount of disturbance of
function is determined by the position of the parasite in the organ.Echinococci may be deposited in any part of the liver--in the substance
of the organ, in the ducts, or in the vessels--but the most usual site
is near the capsule, and, developing outwardly in the direction of
least resistance, impart to the outline of the organ an irregular
contour.As the echinococci develop, the adjacent parts of the liver
pressed upon undergo atrophy, but the connective tissue of the organ
contributes to the formation of the dense capsule which envelops them.But as the increase in size is not rapid, although continuous, if the
cysts are situated at the periphery and adjacent to the capsule, they
may be present for many months without causing any distinct symptoms.In a case occurring under my own observation last year the only symptom
which attracted attention was an enlargement of the hepatic region, and
on examination a characteristic elastic, irregular, and painless tumor
could be readily detected by sight and touch occupying the right
hypochondrium and extending into the epigastric and umbilical regions.When the echinococci cysts impinge on the portal vein or on the hepatic
duct, there will be caused the usual results of such pressure--ascites
or jaundice, or both conditions may occur simultaneously, with
obstruction of both vein and duct.When the cysts develop downwardly,
the stomach and intestines will be displaced, and nausea and vomiting,
diarrhoea or constipation, and, it may be, considerable pain of a
colic-like character, will be caused.An upward development of the
cysts gives rise to more pronounced disturbances.The diaphragm is
pushed upward, the heart displaced, and the lungs, especially the
right, compressed.Occasionally the diaphragm is softened and
perforated by the pressure of the enlarging cysts, and the lungs are
ultimately tunnelled, the parasites being discharged by the bronchi.{1103} The growth of an echinococcus tumor may spontaneously cease, and
then retrograde changes take place, leading to its final disappearance.This arrest of development may occur without any obvious cause, but now
and then such a change from the ordinary course of tumors may be
effected by an external injury, as a blow on the abdomen, but more
frequently the death of the parasite is caused by ulceration into a
bile-duct, and the entrance of bile, which is a poison to these
hydatids.It sometimes happens that, opening into a duct of large size,
the daughter and granddaughter vesicles are slowly discharged through
it into the intestine, and thus a cure is effected.Inflammatory action
occurring in the cysts, adhesions may form and rupture into a
neighboring cavity take place.Direct communication may be established
with the intestine, or the cavity of the pleura or peritoneum be
entered, with results entirely disastrous.A necessarily fatal termination must also ensue when the hydatids
penetrate the ascending vena cava, but this accident is, fortunately,
very rare.The passage outward through the abdominal wall is an exceedingly
uncommon but fortunate issue of echinococcus of the liver, for in this
mode the hydatids may be discharged without much difficulty.The echinococcus vesicle is enveloped in a dense, resisting, and
elastic capsule, constructed out of the connective tissue of the part
in which it is deposited.The innermost layer of the vesicle is the
germinative (endocyst), and from its granular surface are developed the
brood-capsules and their scolices--_i.e._ the head with its suckers and
crown of hooklets.[215] Each vesicle may contain not only daughter, but
also granddaughter, progeny, numbering from a dozen up to many
thousands, and they will vary in size from the head of a pin to a
pullet's egg.It follows that the mother vesicles must also greatly
vary in size: they range from a large pin's head to a child's head.The
vesicles or sacs contain a clear, faintly yellowish, or opalescent
fluid, neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction, and holding in
solution a large per cent.of sodium chloride, but free from albumen.The specific gravity of the fluid ranges from 1007 to 1015, according
to the quantity of sodium chloride present.Succinic acid and also
haematoidin are usual constituents, besides the ingredients already
mentioned.[Footnote 215: _Entozoa_, Cobbold, p.273 _et seq._, chapter viii.]Although the form of hydatid or echinococcus cyst above described is
the usual one, there is occasionally produced an anomalous development
of the parasite, which from its resemblance to colloid cancer was
supposed to have this character until Virchow[216] unravelled the
mystery by demonstrating its true structure.This form of the parasite
is designated Echinococcus multilocularis.Its resemblance to colloid
cancer is the more striking because of the tendency of the interior of
the mass to undergo degeneration, to disintegrate, and to break up into
pus-sacs with greenish, cheesy, and bilious contents.An Echinococcus
multilocularis tumor is of almost stony hardness; it has a very dense
fibrous structure, intersected by cavities with thick gelatinous
contents.These minor cavities[217] are sacs of echinococci, but they
depart widely from the typical form, well-defined scolices being seldom
encountered.[Footnote 216: _Archiv fur Anat._, Virchow, vol.[Footnote 217: Carriere, quoted by Davaine, _op.{1104} Echinococci of the liver develop very slowly, and it is
characteristic of them to attain to very large proportions in most
cases without causing any very pronounced symptoms.There are certain
signs common to hydatids in any situation; there are others which are
due to particular circumstances.A hydatid tumor of the liver is smooth but somewhat irregular in
outline, and elastic, when it develops downward, extending below the
margin of the ribs.If, however, it grows upward, the area of hepatic
dulness extends in that direction beyond the usual limits; the
diaphragm is pushed up, the lungs forced upward to the left and
compressed, and the heart also displaced upward toward the left.The
extension of the tumor downward, in the direction of least resistance,
is more usual.If the walls of the abdomen are sufficiently thin, the
tumor large enough, and if made up of many daughter vesicles, there may
be evoked by palpation the very characteristic sign known as hydatid
purring.To produce this effect an oscillation must be caused by a
sudden impulse communicated to the tumor on one side, the hand resting
against the other side.This sensation is likened to the impression on
the eye of the vibration of a bowl of jelly.Even when there is a
well-defined tumor this symptom is comparatively infrequent, but if
present it is pathognomonic, since no other kind of tumor possesses the
property of oscillation and elastic collision of its several
constituents.When the tumor is so situated as to occlude the hepatic or common duct,
jaundice will be a symptom, and when the stomach is pressed upon there
will be epigastric oppression and nausea.If the vena cava is impinged
on or the portal vein, the usual results--ascites and oedema of the
lower extremities and of the scrotum--will be manifest.There is, of
course, nothing distinctive in these results.The Echinococcus multilocularis, situated in the substance of the
liver, causes the usual disturbances of a new formation in such a
position.Much of the hepatic tissue is destroyed by its growth, and
many of the minor ducts closed.Jaundice is an early symptom--the
first, indeed, in many cases--and is also one of the most persistent.It is present, according to Griesinger, in 10 out of 13 cases.The
usual gastro-intestinal disorders belonging to jaundice occur under
these circumstances; also the nervous disturbances of cholaemia.[218]

[Footnote 218: Davaine, _op.Enlargement of the spleen is a very frequent symptom, being present,
according to Davaine, in 11 out of 13 cases, and, according to Heller,
in 25 out of 29 cases, in which this fact was made the subject of
direct inquiry.Pressure on the vena cava causes oedema of the inferior extremities in
a small number of cases; and on the vena porta, ascites.There may
occur thrombosis of the portal, in which event the ascites will form
very quickly, and return as quickly after tapping.The usually placid course pursued by echinococcus of the liver may be
much modified by inflammation and suppuration.Having occurred, the clinical history
corresponds to other cases of hepatic abscess, and the reader is
therefore referred to the section on that topic for fuller information.DIAGNOSIS.--At the outset of echinococcus of the liver the {1105}
differentiation of the tumor from other tumors, and of the disturbances
produced by it as contrasted with the effects of other morbid growths,
becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.The size,
painlessness, elasticity, the purring tremor of the echinococcus tumor,
afford a sure basis for constructing a diagnosis, and as ultimately
developed they become the means of accurate differentiation from other
morbid growths of that locality.All doubt as to the nature of a given
hydatid tumor of the liver may be set at rest by the use of the
aspirator.The discovery of the characteristic hooklets of the scolex
in the fluid withdrawn from the tumor will be conclusive as to the
presence of echinococci.The hooklets may be absent, as in the case of
acephalocysts, but the fluid is characteristic in other respects: it
contains a large quantity of chloride of sodium and is free from
albumen.Very great difficulty is experienced in diagnosticating an echinococcus
tumor developing from the upper surface of the liver, pushing the
diaphragm and lungs upward and displacing the heart to the left.Whilst
the physical signs may be, and are, usually alike when the condition
calling for diagnosis has existed for some time, there are means of
differentiating in the history of the cases and in the initial
symptoms.The origin and growth of the echinococcus tumor are obscure and free
from constitutional disturbance; the onset of a pleuritic exudation is
marked by pain, fever, and hurried respiration and by physical signs of
a characteristic kind.It is true there are cases of so-called latent
pleurisy in which a hydrothorax forms without any well-marked
indications, but it will usually be found that some local pain, hurried
breathing, or other symptoms existed from the beginning.Those cases of
hydrothorax accompanying renal and cardiac diseases are readily enough
associated with their original cause.Echinococcus of the liver may be confounded with abscess of the liver,
but a differentiation can be readily made by attention to a few
considerations, except in the rare condition of the Echinococcus
multilocularis which has proceeded to suppuration.In this latter
condition there are no means of differentiation, since an
abscess-formation has already occurred, nor is there any need to
attempt a distinction without the occasion of a difference.Echinococcus differs from abscess in history, in the character of the
swelling, and in progress.Abscess of the liver is preceded by
paroxysms of hepatic colic, by inflammatory ulceration of some part of
the intestinal tract, or by local injury--traumatism.The onset of a
hydatid tumor is silent and painless.The swelling of the liver when an
abscess forms is not considerable at any time, and appears to be a
uniform enlargement of the organ, except when the pus tends to make its
way through the walls of the abdomen externally.An enlarging
echinococcus tumor is an obvious projection from the surface of the
liver at some point, and it does not have the characteristic
tenderness, the fluctuation of an abscess matured and ready to
discharge, and the constitutional disturbance; but it does have a
peculiar elasticity, and now and then may present that eminently
characteristic sign, the purring tremor.The use of the
exploring-trocar will usually suffice to clear up all doubts by the
withdrawal of the characteristic fluid of the hydatid cyst or of pus.DURATION AND TERMINATION.--The progress of an echinococcus {1106} tumor
is exceedingly slow, and the development of symptoms produced by its
extension is early or late according to its position and to the nature
of the parts impinged on.A spontaneous cure may take place under the
rather rare circumstances of an opening into the hepatic duct or one of
its principal divisions, and the gradual discharge of the cysts by this
outlet into the intestine.Next to this mode of termination, the most
fortunate direction taken by the enlarging cysts is through the walls
of the abdomen externally.When the growth is upward through the lungs,
the symptoms belonging to empyema or hydrothorax, with pulmonary
abscess, ensue, and the termination is fatal after a protracted course.Rupture into the peritoneal cavity is a fatal event.Ulceration into
the intestine, and the discharge of the cysts through the route thus
made, may effect a cure, but more frequently the fistulous
communication becomes a means of forming a fecal abscess.The result in any case of hydatids of the liver is much influenced by
the mode of treatment adopted and the period at which it is undertaken.As these parasites can be readily reached and destroyed by safe means,
obviously the more early the diagnosis is made and the treatment
carried out, the less the injury done to the hepatic structures and
neighboring parts.TREATMENT.--Prophylactic.--As the intestine of the dog is the natural
habitat of the Taenia echinococcus, and as the hydatid is the first
stage in the development of the ovum and the second in the life-history
of the parasite, the means of prophylaxis consist in preventing
contamination of human food and water with the dog's excrement, which
contains the ova of the parasite.In Iceland, where hydatid disease is
very prevalent, dogs and human beings living in the same huts and
obtaining their water-supply by melting the snow just about them,
contamination of food and drink must readily occur.In this country
such conditions cannot exist; nevertheless, cases of hydatids are not
infrequent.The chief, if not the only, source of contamination is
through the consumption of such uncooked vegetables as lettuce, celery,
cabbage, etc., in the folds of which the ova may be retained, and from
which an ordinary washing does not suffice to detach them.It follows
that such articles of food should be minutely inspected and cleansed
before being placed on the table.Boiling and filtration are the means of removing impurities of this
kind from potable waters.Therapeutical.--The remedial management of cases of Taenia echinococcus
is necessarily restricted to that stage in their development when by
increasing size the functions of organs begin to be affected.Internal
medicines given with the view to arrest the growth of the parasite are
useless.Formerly, such attempts were made and successes were claimed,
but it is now known that no medicine can act on organisms enclosed as
these are in a dense capsule.It is needless to occupy space with
therapeutical details of this kind, but mention may be made of the
agents that were supposed to be effective.Laennec held that baths of a
solution of common salt had a distinct curative effect.The internal
use of iodide of potassium and the local application of iodine paint
were believed to cure a case in St.George's Hospital, London, in the
practice of Mr.Kameela was, in Iceland, supposed to
have a curative effect, but notwithstanding this the physicians of that
island resort to very heroical surgical methods in the treatment of
this affection.{1107} The one means of relief consists in the removal of the vesicles,
either by suitable incisions or by compassing the death of the
parasite, after which the power of nature may be adequate to the cure.In Iceland large incisions are made into the tumor at its most
prominent part, and, although accidents are not uncommon, the results
in many cases are eminently satisfactory.The accidents are shock,
hemorrhage, and especially peritonitis.Under favorable circumstances
now no procedure is more satisfactory in its results than free incision
and drainage.The tumor should be prominent, adherent all round to the
peritoneum, and the walls of the abdomen thin to ensure complete
success without accident.At the present time, so great have been the
advances in abdominal surgery, this operative procedure may be
preferable in some few cases presenting the favoring conditions above
mentioned.Very simple expedients, however, suffice in most cases.This is now much practised in Iceland, and, as the
statistics show, with considerable success.Thus, Hjaltelin[219]
reports 100 cases cured in this way, and in his own hands this
expedient proved successful in 41 out of 50 cases operated on.In
Australia, where hydatid disease is also quite common, simple puncture
has effected a large proportion of cures,[220] and is the method of
treatment usually pursued.In England puncture has the approval of some
of the best authorities.[221]

[Footnote 219: Davaine, _op.[Footnote 220: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, August, 1873, p.[Footnote 221: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_ for 1872:
discussion participated in by Gull, Bryant, Greenhow, etc.]The mode of performing this operation consists in the introduction of
an exploring-trocar into the most prominent part of the tumor.It may
be withdrawn at once or be permitted to remain for a few minutes to
several hours.The dangers are suppuration in the sac and peritonitis;
but the former, although sometimes accompanied by severe constitutional
symptoms, is not likely to endanger life, and even formidable
disturbances due to the latter are usually recovered from.The facts
show that puncture very rarely indeed causes dangerous, especially
fatal, symptoms.An eruption of urticaria has been observed to follow
puncture with the trocar, and also aspiration, in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but it has no special significance.Since the introduction of the aspirateur, puncture and withdrawal of
the fluid by means of this instrument has been practised more
frequently, and this appears to be a more effective procedure, than
simple puncture with an exploring-trocar, although in most cases the
escape of the contained fluids suffices to destroy the parasite.The
aspirateur is less likely to permit the escape of fluid into the
peritoneal cavity or the entrance of air into a vein punctured by
accident.If puncture with the trocar or aspiration be practised, shall
all the fluid be withdrawn at once?The answer to this question may be
decided by the character of the sac.Does it contain daughter and
granddaughter vesicles?If so, one puncture may not permit the escape
of much fluid; but in any event it is the practice of the most
judicious and experienced authorities[222] to withdraw as much as
possible of the contents of the cysts at the first operation.Formerly,
a method practised by some French surgeons consisted in successive
tappings, a small quantity of fluid being drawn off each time.[223]
{1108} There is no good reason for this method of treatment now, and it
seems to have been discontinued.[Footnote 222: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 223: Davaine, _supra_.]Yet another method of treatment, but less effective than puncture or
aspiration, consists in injecting into the sac, after the removal of
its contained fluid, certain agents toxic to hydatids.A solution of
the extract of fern, alcohol, solution or tincture of iodine, and bile,
are the chief remedies thus employed.It has long been known that bile
is destructive of these parasites, and cases have occurred of
spontaneous cure in which the opening of the growing cysts into a
bile-duct has secured the entrance of bile and consequent arrest of
growth and atrophy of the hydatids.Several successful cases have been
reported in which the injection of aspidium (male fern) was the
effective agent, but the threatening symptoms produced by it, and the
comparative freedom of other methods of treatment from such
disturbances, do not recommend the injections of fern.In the case
reported by Pavy[224] the extract of fern was mixed with a solution of
potassa.[Footnote 224: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1865.]Injections of iodine in solution or in the form of tincture have been
more frequently practised than of any other material.Davaine,[225] who
finds it less successful than simple puncture and aspiration,
recommends, as affording the best results, a dilute aqueous solution of
iodine.Alcohol, a solution of permanganate of potassium, and various
antiseptic agents have been used to some extent, but none of them
possess any advantages over more simple measures.The latest proposal for the treatment of hydatid cysts, and probably
the most effective consistent with entire safety, is electrolysis.Originally suggested by Althaus[226] to those who first employed the
measure on any considerable scale, it had been mentioned thirty years
before by Budd, and appears to have been first practised in Iceland on
a single case.The first elaborate attempt to establish electrolysis on
a sound basis as a regular procedure was made by C. Hilton Fagge and
Mr.[227] They operated on eight cases, and all were
successful.The method consists in the introduction of two needles
connected with the negative pole, and the application of the
positive--a moistened sponge--on the exterior in the neighborhood of
the hepatic region.The strength of current employed by Fagge and
Durham was that furnished by a battery of ten cells, and which by
previous trial was found to decompose a saline solution.The two
electrolytic needles, connected with wires attached to the negative
pole, were introduced into the most prominent part of the tumor about
two inches apart.The current was allowed to pass about ten minutes
usually, sometimes a little longer, the sponge on the exterior--the
positive pole--being shifted occasionally.The tumor may be rendered somewhat more tense and
appear to be enlarged, but more frequently it becomes softer and is
lessened in size, the increase of size being due to the disengagement
of hydrogen gas, and the diminution caused by the escape of more or
less fluid.In one case
no symptom followed, and in this the result was regarded as doubtful,
although a cure was considered probable.In the others more or less
{1109} constitutional disturbance followed, the symptoms being pain and
fever, the temperature ranging between 100 degrees and 103 degrees F.
The duration of the fever was from two to nineteen days, the latter in
one case only.As has been observed in some of the cases treated by
puncture or by aspiration, a rash appeared on the skin--in some
instances scarlatinous, in others of urticaria.It is a curious
circumstance that an eruption of urticaria is reported to have appeared
in one subject in whom a rupture of the sac into the peritoneal cavity
is supposed to have occurred.[Footnote 226: _On the Electrolytic Treatment of Tumors, etc._, London,
1867.][Footnote 227: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, 1871, p.1 _et seq._]

Although so little change in the tumor occurs immediately after the
operation, yet it undergoes slow absorption, and ultimately disappears.The time occupied in the disappearance of the tumor varies from a few
weeks to many months, the difference being due probably to the
situation of the growth, those occupying the substance of the liver
requiring a longer time to fill up.Fagge and Durham report a case in which simple acupuncture was followed
by a result apparently as good as obtained by electrolysis, and other
similar experiences have been published.If the simple introduction of
a needle suffices to arrest the growth of a hydatid cyst and induce its
atrophy, of course the more complex procedures will be abandoned.The tendency of the treatment of hydatid cysts has constantly been
toward simplicity, and the success occurs in a direct ratio thereto.In
forming an estimate of the relative value of the methods of treatment,
the average of mortality of each plan becomes the most important
factor.Simple tapping and paracentesis, the most frequently adopted
mode of treatment, is not without immediate and remote danger.Of 46
cases carefully tabulated by Murchison,[228] there were 3 deaths
properly attributable to the operation; but the after
results--suppuration of the cyst and its consequences, peritonitis,
etc.--cannot be measured so accurately.About two-thirds of the cases
thus treated result in cure, and in a majority of these a single
operation suffices.The injection of the various substances which have
been employed for that purpose does not seem to increase the proportion
of cures, and their use distinctly enhances the dangers of the
treatment.At present, the decision as to the method of treatment to be
employed in any case should be made between simple tapping,
electrolysis, and acupuncture.Of these, the last mentioned, it can
hardly be doubted, is the method which is most desirable, for although
it has not been employed so largely as the others, thus far the results
have been better: the percentage of recoveries without accident has
been higher relatively than by other methods of treatment.As
acupuncture presents no special difficulties or dangers, and is but
little painful, it may be tried first, reserving more formidable
measures for the failures by this simple expedient.[Footnote 228: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]


Distoma hepaticum and Distoma lanceolatum (Liver-Flukes).The Distoma hepaticum, entitled by Linnaeus Fasciola hepatica, occurs
very frequently in herbivorous animals and occasionally in the biliary
{1110} passages of man.[229] It is, however, less important than the
Distoma lanceolatum, which, although much smaller than the former,
occurs in much larger numbers.[Footnote 229: Davaine, _Traite des Entozoaires_, Paris, 1877, p.240
_et seq._; also, Cobbold, _Entozoa_, p.Distoma hepaticum is a leech-like parasite from 25 to 30 mm.in length,
of a brownish color, smooth to the naked eye, but thickly covered with
minute spikes or spines to be seen with a low power, and provided with
a cephalic (entrance to oral cavity) and an abdominal sucking disk,
which are also organs of locomotion.The Distoma lanceolatum owes its
name to its lancet shape; it is smaller than D. hepaticum, measuring
about 8 mm.in length and half this or less in width; it is unprovided
with spines, but contains two suckers at the side.Both parasites are
hermaphrodite; the ova, according to Cobbold (p.166), have "an average
longitudinal diameter of 1/180, whilst their greatest transversal
measurement is about 1/270."These ova are capable of some movement,
provided as they are with a ciliated envelope.The disease known as the rot in sheep, and a peculiar cachexia entitled
by Davaine la cachexie aqueuse, are caused by the presence of distoma.The ova gain access to man through the use of unwashed cress, lettuce,
and similar vegetables eaten in the raw state, and in drinking-water.The number of reported examples
collected from all sources by the indefatigable Davaine is twelve.[230]

[Footnote 230: _Ibid._, p.253 _et seq._]

The larger distoma passes into the common and hepatic duct and
gall-bladder, whilst the smaller (lanceolatum) enters the finer
ramifications, and, there multiplying, several consequences may ensue.The irritation caused by their presence and development will excite a
more or less severe cholangitis, or, accumulating in sufficient
numbers, an actual obstruction will be induced, and jaundice and
structural alterations of the liver will in turn be brought on.The DIAGNOSIS of such a malady is, in the very nature of the case,
uncertain at best, and in most cases impossible.Nevertheless, it may
be made in rare instances.The existence of the rot may cast suspicion
on the mutton and kitchen vegetables so situated as to suggest the
possibility of contamination with the ova of distoma.Definite and
conclusive information will be afforded by the presence of the ova,
still more of the more or less fully-developed parasite, in the feces
of a patient effected by the symptoms of catarrhal jaundice or
occlusion of the biliary passages.By tapping the gall-bladder
parasites may be withdrawn.The SYMPTOMS are those common to cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts
(cholangitis), catarrhal jaundice, or occlusion of the passages, as may
be.As these have been detailed under their respective heads, it is not
necessary to repeat the observations already made.As regards the TREATMENT, in addition to the methods of management
recommended in such cases it may be stated that the use of certain
parasiticides offers a reasonable prospect of good results.Creasote,
bichloride of mercury, thymol, eucalyptol, oil of wintergreen
(gaultheria), and similar agents are rational remedies and should be
fairly tried.{1111} Parasites in the Portal Vein.The entozoon which by its presence in the blood causes the disease
chyluria also inhabits the portal vein.In some parts of the
world--Brazil more especially--this disease is exceedingly common.It
has occurred also in two or three instances in England, and the writer
has had a case within the past year (1884) in Philadelphia.The
parasites in this case were found in immense numbers in the urine.The blood of the portal vein sometimes is actually filled, and the
liver substance itself is penetrated, by them, but nothing is known of
the alterations they induce in these organs.When cases of haematuria
or chylous urine due to the Filaria sanguinis hominis occur, the
changes are not confined to the urinary organs, but often, doubtless,
involve the liver.There are no signs in the present state of our
knowledge by which the existence of these parasites in the portal vein
and liver can be determined.{1112}

DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS.BY LOUIS STARR, M.D.Until the middle of the seventeenth century the prevalent views upon
the functions and diseases of the pancreas were vague in the extreme.By some the organ was regarded simply as a cushion provided for the
protection of the neighboring blood-vessels and nerves; by others it
was looked upon as the seat of lesion in many very diverse diseases, as
ague, hypochondriasis, melancholia, and so on.In 1642, Wirsung's discovery of an excretory duct demonstrated the fact
that the pancreas was a special organ, and initiated the successful
investigation of the physiology and pathology of the gland.For many
years after this, however, little progress was made, and it is only
comparatively recent investigations that have furnished definite and
reliable information upon the subject.Even now our knowledge of the
clinical and pathological features of diseases of the pancreas is far
behind that of many of the other viscera of the body, the chief reasons
for this being the uncertainty in regard to the physiology of the gland
and the rarity with which its lesions are primary and uncomplicated.ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.--The pancreas is a long, somewhat flattened,
narrow, acinous gland, pinkish-white in color, and of looser texture
than the salivary glands, which it otherwise closely resembles in
structure.It is hammer-shaped, measures from six to eight inches in
length, one and a half inches in breadth, and about three-fourths of an
inch in thickness, and varies in weight from three to five ounces.The
gland is situated in the upper part of the abdominal cavity; the
expanded portion, or head, lies in the concavity of the duodenum;
thence it extends transversely across the epigastric and both
hypochondriac regions on a level with the first lumbar vertebra and in
contact with the posterior abdominal wall.As it passes toward the left
it gradually decreases in size, and the narrowest part, or tail, rests
against the spleen.Behind the organ are the crura of the diaphragm,
the aorta, the inferior cava, the superior mesenteric vessels, and the
solar plexus; in front of it, the stomach and the left lobe of the
liver.Its anterior surface alone is invested with peritoneum, being
covered by the posterior layer of the lesser omentum.The ascending
portion of the head is intimately connected with the duodenum by dense
connective tissue, and at times the descending portion, by extending
backward and outward, forms an almost complete ring around the gut; the
body is loosely attached by connective tissue to the posterior
abdominal wall, and the {1113} left extremity and tail are joined to
the left kidney and suprarenal capsule and to the spleen by loose
areolar tissue.The gland is supplied with arterial blood by branches
springing from the pancreatico-duodenal and splenic vessels; its veins
join the splenic and superior mesenteric veins; its lymphatics
communicate with the lumbar glands; and its nerves are branches from
the solar plexus.The principal excretory duct, the canal of Wirsung,
has at its widest part the calibre of a goose-quill.It begins by the
union of five small branches at the tail, and extends transversely
through the substance of the gland from left to right, nearer the lower
than the upper border, and the anterior than the posterior surface; it
is joined throughout its course by numerous small branches from the
acini, which enter it at acute angles.In the head the duct curves
slightly downward, and as a rule opens with the ductus choledochus into
the ampulla of Vater in the second portion of the duodenum; sometimes,
however, it has a separate opening into the intestine.A second,
smaller, duct runs from the ascending portion of the head, and usually
joins the main duct, but may also open independently.The acini of the gland are from.045 mm.in diameter, and
are composed of a very thin membrane lined with pavement cells.The
thin walls of the excretory ducts are formed of connective tissue and
elastic fibres, and are lined by a single layer of small cylindrical
epithelial cells.The terminal extremities of the ducts form a complete
network around the glandular cells, resembling the intralobular biliary
canaliculi.The acini are imbedded in a mass of adipose tissue which
contains the vessels and nerves.The topographical relation of the head of the pancreas to the ductus
choledochus is of clinical importance.As a rule (fifteen times in
twenty-two, Wyss), the bile-duct descends near the head, toward the
duodenum; frequently it runs through this part of the organ, being
either partially or entirely surrounded by the gland substance.Now,
when the bile-duct merely passes over the pancreas, any enlargement,
unless excessive, would simply push it aside, but when it passes
through the head, a comparatively slight amount of disease is
sufficient to close it entirely and cause jaundice.It is only since the observations of Bernard in 1848 that the
prominence of the pancreatic juice as a digestive fluid has been
recognized.It fulfils several important purposes: in the first place,
it emulsifies the fatty articles of food; secondly, it converts starch
and cane-sugar into glucose; and, finally, it supplements the action of
the gastric juice upon nitrogenous materials and completes their
digestion.Each of these changes is probably brought about through the
agency of a special ferment (Danilewsky).The pancreatic juice is not
secreted continuously.According to the observations of Bernstein,
there are two separate secretory flows following each ingestion of
food--one occurring shortly after the food enters the stomach; the
other a few hours later, corresponding in time to the passage of the
food from the stomach into the intestine, the latter being followed by
a period of rest until the next meal.Both the condition of nausea and
the act of vomiting arrest the secretion.When the vagus is divided and
the central extremity of the cut nerve is irritated, the secretion is
also arrested, and remains checked {1114} for a long time.The arrest
in each instance is attributed to reflex action of the spinal cord and
sympathetic nerve.At the same time, irritation of the mucous membrane
of the stomach caused by the presence of food increases the flow of
pancreatic juice, and so too does simple section of the nerves which
accompany the arteries.It would seem, therefore, that the gland is
under the influence of two sets of nerves from the vagus--one
inhibiting, the other exciting, its secretion.GENERAL ETIOLOGY.--Pancreatic disease occurs more frequently in men
than in women.No period of life is exempt from it, but it is most
commonly met with in the aged.The predisposing causes are
constitutional syphilis, pregnancy, and hereditary tendency.Among the
apparent exciting causes may be mentioned the habitual over-use of
alcoholic drinks, gluttony, the excessive use of tobacco, suppression
of the menstrual flux, the abuse of purgatives, excessive and prolonged
mercurial medication, and mechanical injuries, either prolonged
pressure or blows upon the epigastrium.As a secondary affection,
disease of the pancreas is associated with chronic diseases of the
heart, lungs, liver, alimentary canal, and abdominal glands, and the
organ may be the seat of metastatic abscesses and tumors.GENERAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The objective symptoms are--rapid and extreme
emaciation of the entire body; sialorrhoea; obstinate diarrhoea with
viscid stools; fatty stools; lipuria; and the presence of masses of
undigested striped muscular fibres in the stools.The well-established fat-absorbing and peptonizing properties of the
pancreatic juice furnish a ready explanation of the wasting of the body
which occurs when this secretion is arrested, diminished in quantity,
or altered in quality by disease.Emaciation is not a constant symptom
of pancreatic disease.A number of cases are mentioned by Abercrombie,
Claessen, and Schiff in which, notwithstanding disease of the gland and
complete closure of the duct, revealed by post-mortem examination, the
patients during life were not only well nourished, but even moderately
corpulent.In such instances it is probable that the digestive
functions of the absent pancreatic juice are more or less adequately
performed by the bile and succus entericus.When present, emaciation is
an early symptom; it is at the same time progressive, and is usually
very intense in degree, being most marked in those cases where there is
associated hepatic disease or obstruction to the passage of bile into
the intestine, where the disease of the pancreas interferes
mechanically with the processes of nutrition by pressing upon the
pyloric extremity of the stomach or upon the duodenum, and when the
organ is the seat of carcinomatous growths.In the last-named
condition, in addition to the perversion or arrest of the secretion,
the loss of flesh is attributable to the general causes of malnutrition
attendant upon carcinoma wherever situated.Sialorrhoea, or an excessive secretion from the salivary glands, is
noticeable as a symptom of disease of the pancreas only when there is
an associated lesion of the stomach, either of a catarrhal or cancerous
nature.Under these circumstances a quantity--six or eight
fluidounces--of a colorless, slightly opalescent, and adhesive and
alkaline fluid may be expelled from the mouth at once as an early
morning pyrosis; or by frequent and repeated acts of expectoration,
following a sudden filling of the mouth with fluid, a large bulk of
thin saliva may be expelled {1115} during the day.This hypersecretion
must not be looked upon as any indication of an especial sympathy
existing between the salivary glands and the pancreas, neither can it
be regarded as a pancreatic flux with a regurgitation of the fluid from
the duodenum into the stomach and thence through the oesophagus into
the mouth, since during the nausea that must always attend the passage
of the intestinal contents into the stomach the pancreatic secretion is
arrested, and since the liquid contains salivary, and not pancreatic,
elements.The diarrhoea pancreatica is the least constant of all the objective
symptoms; in fact, constipation is present in many pancreatic
affections, notably carcinoma.The fecal evacuations in this condition
are frequent, thin, viscid, and contain an abundance of leucin.Under
the microscope the leucin appears either in the form of concentrically
sheathed globules, or as small crystalline rods and scales collected
together in the form of wheels or aggregated in clusters.This form of
diarrhoea may be attributed to a hypersecretion from the pancreas.That the presence of fat in the stools is an important diagnostic
symptom of pancreatic disease is proved both by clinical and
experimental observations.The characters of these stools vary
considerably.The fat may appear mixed with the feces in small lumps,
ranging in size from a pea to a hazelnut, yellowish-white in color,
soluble in aether, and easily melted and burned.Again, after the
evacuation has become cool fat may be seen covering the fecal masses,
collected into a thick cake around the edges of the containing vessel,
or, when the feces are liquid, floating as free oil on the surface.Finally, the fat may be in a crystalline form, the crystals being
needle-shaped and aggregated into sheaves and tufts.It may be present only in small quantities, or may
even be entirely absent from the evacuations in those cases in which
the secretion from the pancreas is simply diminished, and the amount is
greatest in those instances where there is a simultaneous arrest of the
pancreatic and hepatic secretions.It must be remembered, too, that
even in health the stools may contain fat; this occurs when an excess
of oleaginous food is consumed and after the administration of castor
oil or cod-liver oil.These conditions must be eliminated, therefore,
in estimating the value of fatty stools as a diagnostic symptom; if,
then, at the same time, coincident disease of the liver can be
excluded, the symptom becomes almost pathognomonic.The appearance of
fat in the stools may be due not only to an arrest of the pancreatic
secretion, but also to pressure upon the large lymphatic trunks,
interfering with the circulation of the chyle and checking the
absorption of fat from the intestine.Usually, the amount of fat expelled is in direct proportion to the
quantity consumed, but occasionally the former greatly exceeds the
latter.In such cases there must be some other source for the evacuated
fat than the food; and it is probable that fat from the adipose tissue
passes into the blood, and thence through the mesenteric vessels into
the intestine.This theory would likewise account in part for the rapid
and extreme wasting, and for another less frequently observed
symptom--namely, lipuria.A case is recorded by Clark of medullary
cancer of the pancreas with nutmeg liver, and another by Bowditch of
cancer of the pancreas and liver in which lipuria was noted.The fat
was observed, after the urine had cooled, floating about on the surface
in masses or globules; differing, {1116} therefore, from chyluria, for
in this condition the fat is present in the form of an emulsion, and
gives the urine either a uniform milk-like appearance, or, after it has
been allowed to stand, rests upon the surface in a creamy layer.When the pancreatic secretion is arrested, most of the animal food
which has escaped gastric digestion will pass unchanged through the
intestine and give rise to another characteristic condition of the
evacuations--namely, the presence in the feces of undigested striped
muscular fibres.The amount of these fibres, and indeed their
appearance at all in any given case, will depend directly upon the
nature of the food consumed.SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS.--The subjective symptoms of disease of the
pancreas are abnormal sensations in the epigastrium, and pain.The abnormal sensations in the epigastrium are weight and pressure,
attended at times by praecordial oppression and discomfort.The feeling
of weight is usually deep-seated, may be intermittent or constant, and
is generally increased or developed by pressure.It is often influenced
by position, the assumption of the erect posture or turning from side
to side giving rise to a stretching or dragging sensation, as if a
heavy body were falling downward or moving about in the upper abdomen.The pain may be due either to an inflammation of the peritoneum
covering the gland or to pressure upon the solar plexus, and
consequently varies in character.When it depends upon localized
peritonitis, it is constant, circumscribed, and deeply seated in the
epigastrium at a point midway between the tip of the ensiform cartilage
and the umbilicus; it is rather acute, and is greatly augmented by
pressure.The second variety occurs in paroxysms, and is neuralgic in
character, the sharp, excessively severe lancinating pains extending
from the epigastrium through to the back, upward into the thorax, and
downward into the abdomen.These paroxysms--in reality attacks of
coeliac neuralgia--are attended by great anxiety, restlessness, and
oppression and a tendency to syncope.That calculi in the duct of
Wirsung, tightly grasped at the position of arrest, may give rise to
paroxysms of pain analogous to biliary colic, cannot be doubted, though
there are no positive facts in support of this view.PRESSURE SYMPTOMS.--When the pancreas becomes enlarged it encroaches
upon the neighboring blood-vessels and viscera, interferes with their
functions, and thus produces prominent symptoms.The ductus choledochus from its close relation to the head of the gland
is especially liable to become obstructed, with the consequent
production of chronic jaundice and the general effects of the absence
of bile from the intestinal canal.Pressure upon the portal vein gives
rise to enlargement of the spleen; on the inferior cava, to oedema of
the feet and legs; and on the aorta, occasionally, to aneurismal
dilatation of the vessel above the point of obstruction and to
subsequent alteration in the size of the heart.By encroaching on the
stomach an enlarged pancreas may cause either displacement of the
viscus or stenosis at its pyloric extremity, attended with occasional
vomiting of large quantities of grumous, fermenting liquid, pain,
constipation, general failure of health, and the distinctive physical
signs of dilatation of the stomach.The duodenum may also be pressed
upon and more or less occluded, and pain and vomiting occur several
hours after food is taken.Occasionally hydronephrosis is {1117}
produced, the accumulation being usually in the right kidney and due to
obstruction of the corresponding ureter.A sufficient number of cases have been collected to show that there is
an intimate connection between disease of the pancreas and diabetes
mellitus.One or other condition may take the precedence, melituria
occurring during the progress of pancreatic disease, demonstrating the
onset of diabetes, and the appearance of fatty stools in diabetes a
secondary involvement of the pancreas.Various theories have been
advanced to account for this association, but the true explanation
seems to be based upon the experiments of Munk and Klebs.By
experimenting upon dogs these observers found that extirpation of the
solar plexus produced either permanent or temporary diabetes, whereas
section of the hepatic and splanchnic nerves, removal of the pancreas,
or ligature of the duct of Wirsung was without effect.From the
intimate anatomical relation of the pancreas to the solar plexus it is
easy to understand how disease of the gland may give rise to
alterations in the nerve-structure, either by direct pressure or by the
extension of inflammation along the nerve-fibres connecting the gland
with the ganglia; and these alterations in time produce diabetes.In
the instances in which diabetes is the primary affection the condition
of the pancreas, as proved by post-mortem section, is usually one of
simple or fatty atrophy; and it may be assumed that a lesion of the
solar plexus is the cause of both diseases, the changes in the pancreas
being produced in a similar way to the atrophy of the submaxillary
gland after section of the vaso-motor nerves in Bernard's experiments.The same nerve-lesion may give rise to bronzing of the skin, and two
cases are recorded in which disease of the pancreas (cheesy
infiltration, cancer) was attended by this symptom.PHYSICAL SIGNS.--To make a successful exploration of the pancreas the
stomach and colon should be as far as possible empty, and the patient
placed in a position, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated and
the thighs drawn up toward the belly, to relax the abdominal muscles;
or if necessary this relaxation must be brought about by the
administration of aether.The knee-elbow position is often preferable
to the dorsal position in practising palpation.The condition of the gland giving rise to physical signs is one of
enlargement, affecting chiefly and primarily its head, and due
generally to the presence of some morbid growth.Inspection reveals either a diffuse bulging of the upper third of the
abdomen to the right of the median line, or a well-defined tumor
situated beneath the right costal border, about the line of junction of
the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions.Often the pancreatic
tumor does not come in direct contact with the abdominal wall, but
presses against and thrusts forward the left lobe of the liver,
producing simply a prominence in the epigastrium.In the first
condition palpation elicits an ill-defined sense of resistance; in the
second, the fingers readily outline a tumor, which is slightly movable,
rounded in shape, firm or fluctuating, with a smooth or nodulated
surface, usually tender to the touch, and often giving a false impulse
transmitted from the aorta lying beneath; and in the third, the smooth
surface and the sharp edge of the left lobe of the liver are easily
distinguishable.{1118} Percussion over a pancreatic tumor is commonly dully-tympanitic,
absolute flatness occurring only when it is very large and comes
directly in contact with the abdominal wall, pushing aside the stomach
and intestines.On auscultation a blowing murmur may, in some instances, be heard over
the tumor.These murmurs are due to pressure upon the aorta, and must
be distinguished from the sound produced in aneurism of this vessel.The various complications of pancreatic disease, such as dilatation of
the stomach, ascites, and secondary lesions of the liver, greatly
modify the physical signs, and sometimes entirely prevent an
exploration of the gland.INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Acute Idiopathic Pancreatitis.It occurs most frequently in males during and
after adult life, and the strumous diathesis appears to predispose to
it.Intemperance, the suppression of normal or morbid discharges, and
traumatism act as exciting causes.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The pathological changes may be divided into
two stages.In the first the gland is deep red in color, intensely
injected with blood, greatly increased in consistence, enlarged to the
extent of two or three times its normal size, and when an incision is
made the divided lobules feel firm and crisp.The interlobular tissue
is sometimes dotted with bloody points, and the same hemorrhagic
changes may occur in the connective tissue surrounding the gland.In
this stage resolution may occur or the inflammation may pass into
suppuration.At the beginning of the second, or suppurative, stage
numerous minute collections of pus are seen scattered throughout the
gland in the interacinous tissue; these gradually collect into a single
large abscess, and at times the whole gland is converted into a mere
pus-sac, the capsule being much thickened.In other instances the
formation of pus is entirely peripancreatic.The pus is usually
inodorous and creamy, but is sometimes grayish-white or greenish in
color; it then has a faint disagreeable odor, and occasionally is very
fetid.When mixed with pancreatic juice it becomes clear and yellowish
in color, and contains numerous minute curd-like masses.In the first stage secondary peritonitis may arise from a simple
extension of the inflammatory process, and bands of lymph are formed,
gluing the pancreas to the neighboring organs.In the second, fatal
acute peritonitis may result from the bursting of an abscess into the
peritoneal cavity.These abscesses also occasionally open into the
duodenum or stomach.Gangrene and peripancreatic sloughing occur very
exceptionally, and are probably due to extensive hemorrhagic changes.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The disease may be preceded for an indefinite
period by symptoms of impaired gastric or intestinal digestion, but its
onset is usually sudden.The attack begins with colic or continuous
{1119} deep-seated pain, starting in the epigastrium and extending
toward the right shoulder or the back, and quickly becoming very
intense.The pain is attended by pallor of the face, great
restlessness, praecordial anxiety, dyspnoea, and faintness.The tongue
is furred or dry and red; thirst is increased; the appetite is lost;
there are frequent eructations, nausea, and constant vomiting of a
clear, greenish, viscid fluid; the vomiting produces no sense of
relief, and even increases the epigastric pain.The bowels are
obstinately constipated.The epigastric region is tense, tumid, and
excessively tender, so that it is usually impossible to elicit the
physical signs of enlargement of the gland.There is moderate pyrexia,
with evening exacerbations, and the pulse is increased in frequency.These symptoms progressively increase in severity, and reach their
maximum intensity in from three to five days.The pulse then becomes
small, compressible, and irregular, the extremities cold, the face
hippocratic, and death takes place in a state of collapse.The fatal
termination is preceded by the symptoms of acute peritonitis in the
cases which are complicated by an extension of inflammation or the
rupture of an abscess into the peritoneal cavity.Recovery is quite possible in the early stage of the disease.On the
other hand, the course may be greatly protracted by a change in the
type of the inflammation, resulting in induration and enlargement of
the gland or in the formation of chronic abscesses.Again, when
peritonitis from extension has been confined solely to the portion of
the peritoneum that covers the gland, and has resulted in the formation
of fibrinous bands binding the pancreas to the adjacent viscera, the
symptoms of pancreatitis will on subsiding give place to those of
obstruction of the stomach, duodenum, or bile-duct.DIAGNOSIS.--The diseases most likely to be confounded with acute
pancreatitis are biliary colic and the catarrhal form of acute
gastritis.From biliary colic it is distinguished by the absence of rigors,
jaundice, enlargement of the liver, and a tender pyriform tumor
corresponding in situation to the gall-bladder and due to its
distension with accumulated bile.The pain in both affections is sudden
in its onset, and very similar in character and distribution; but when
caused by the passage of a gall-stone it usually begins either after a
heavy meal or after some severe muscular exertion or shaking of the
body--circumstances inoperative in the production of the pain of
pancreatitis.The pain, too, in the former condition is less severe at
first, increases gradually in severity, is more paroxysmal, is at the
outset lessened by pressure, and is often temporarily relieved by the
act of vomiting.The attacks at the same time are rarely isolated, and
all doubt is removed when the pain ceases suddenly and a calculus is
discovered in the feces.Acute gastric catarrh is almost always traceable to the ingestion of
some irritant substance, usually alcohol or food of bad quality.This
history, together with the liability of the attack to occur during the
course of chronic dyspepsia, the comparatively trifling severity of the
pain, the headache, the irregularity of the bowels, the condition of
the urine, which is either high- or deposits lithates
abundantly, and the tendency of the affection to become chronic, are
the points of distinction between this and the pancreatic disease.{1120} Acute inflammation of the stomach, or gastritis proper,
resulting from corrosive poisons, presents a train of symptoms entirely
different from those of acute pancreatitis.TREATMENT.--Absolute rest is essential.The diet should consist of milk
guarded by lime-water and of meat-broths, this food being administered
in small quantities--one to two or three fluidounces of the milk and
lime-water or half as much broth--at proper intervals.In the early
stage an effort must be made to reduce the inflammation by the
application of ice to the epigastrium or of leeches to the same region,
or preferably to the anus.The excessive pain demands the free use of
opium.The nausea and vomiting may be relieved to some extent by
directing the patient to swallow small lumps of ice, and by the
employment of iced carbonic-acid water and the effervescing draught;
and the tendency to constipation may be overcome by enemata.Later in
the course of the disease, if the epigastric tenderness permits of it,
light linseed poultices should be placed over the upper abdomen.During
the stage of collapse alcoholic stimulants and the application of heat
to the extremities are necessary.The occurrence of acute peritonitis
or other complications and sequelae demand appropriate treatment.In this condition the pancreas may be the seat of either acute
parenchymatous inflammation or of metastatic abscesses.Acute parenchymatous degeneration of the muscles, kidneys, liver, and
so on is recognized as a frequent lesion in the acute infectious
diseases, particularly typhoid fever; and it is under these
circumstances, and in association always with similar changes in some
of the organs mentioned, that parenchymatous degeneration of the
pancreas takes place.Metastatic suppurative inflammation is very rare: it has been observed
in cases of disease of the testicles after the operation of extirpation
of these organs, and occasionally in puerperal peritonitis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--In parenchymatous inflammation the gland at
first is hardened, swollen, and reddened, and on section presents a
reddish-gray surface, with indistinctness of the glandular structure,
due to the amount of swelling of the acini.Under the microscope the
gland-cells are found to be enlarged; they contain several nuclei,
their protoplasm is infiltrated with fatty granules, obscuring the
nuclei to a certain extent, and their outline is well defined.These
alterations are most marked in the head of the gland.After a time the
hypertrophy of the cells, by pressing upon the blood-vessels, produces
an anaemic condition and the organ becomes pale; in the advanced stages
softening occurs.Metastatic suppurative inflammation leads to the formation of a single
large abscess or to multiple minute purulent collections.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--Parenchymatous degeneration gives rise to no
distinctive symptoms.Its occurrence in typhoid fever or other
infectious disease may be suspected when after prolonged hyperpyrexia
there are enlargement of the liver and spleen and albuminuria.The
appearance of jaundice (from pressure) increases the probability of
involvement of the pancreas in the general gland-change.{1121} The development of rigors, alternating with flushing, during the
course of one of the lesions liable to be attended with metastatic
abscesses in the pancreas might suggest the formation of pus in the
gland, but an absolute diagnosis is impossible.Several cases are on record pointing to the possibility of a metastasis
of mumps from the parotid gland to the pancreas.In these the
disappearance of the parotiditis was followed by symptoms resembling
those of idiopathic pancreatitis--namely, thirst, fever, loss of
appetite, anxiety, and burning in the epigastrium, with deep-seated
pain extending toward the right side; in addition there was diarrhoea,
with numerous, yellowish, watery stools.In one case that resulted
fatally the secondary diarrhoea suddenly ceased and the parotid
swelling reappeared.At the autopsy the pancreas was found to be
swollen, reddened, engorged with blood, and indurated.Such a
metastasis, however, must be very infrequent, and more extended
observations are necessary to establish its course and clinical
features.The first form of acute secondary pancreatitis may be a comparatively
unimportant complication of the acute infectious diseases, or, together
with the parenchymatous degeneration of other organs, may form a
distinct element in the fatal issue of these diseases.Metastatic abscesses are prone to be followed by ulceration and the
formation of fistulous communications with the neighboring viscera.TREATMENT.--The management of secondary inflammation of the pancreas is
regulated solely by the indications derived from the originating
disease.Inflammation of the connective tissue of the gland usually occurs after
adult life, and depends upon a variety of causes.The secondary form, due to long-continued venous engorgement resulting
from lesions of the cardiac valves and from chronic disease of the
lungs or liver, is the most frequently observed.Other causes are closure of the duct of Wirsung, the retained secretion
producing pressure upon the glandular tissue; the extension of
inflammation from adjacent organs, as the bile-duct when there is an
impacted gall-stone, or the stomach and duodenum, especially in cancer
and perforating ulcer, where the floor of the ulcer is formed by the
pancreas; the pressure of tumors, as aneurisms of the abdominal aorta
and coeliac axis; chronic alcoholism; and syphilis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The lesion may be limited to the head or to
isolated portions of the gland, or be uniformly distributed.The
general changes are a hyperplasia of the interacinous connective
tissue, with subsequent contraction and atrophy, or, in extreme
instances, entire destruction of the glandular elements proper, the
organ becoming granular and firmer and tougher than normal.A section
shows a pale surface, studded at intervals with white spots, from which
little cheese-like and fatty masses may be squeezed, and, when there
has been intense hyperaemia, with minute collections of reddish pigment
and small hemorrhagic cysts, indicating previous interstitial
hemorrhages.{1122} When the contraction causes closure of the small excretory ducts
or of the duct of Wirsung itself, the section shows secondary cysts and
beaded canals.In exceptional instances of acquired syphilis the pancreas is the seat
of gummata or sclerosis, but in congenital syphilis hyperplasia of the
glandular connective tissue frequently occurs, being usually associated
with specific lesions of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and general
glandular system.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--As chronic pancreatitis rarely attains a
sufficient degree of development to interfere seriously with the
function of the organ, the disease is usually latent, or masked by the
symptoms of the originating lesion in secondary hyperplasia, or by the
associated diseases of the abdominal viscera in alcoholism and acquired
syphilis.When due to hereditary syphilis, the foetus is stillborn or death takes
place soon after birth, and there are no characteristic symptoms.Occasionally, however, especially when it depends upon a complete
obstruction of the duct of Wirsung, a diagnosis may be made from the
presence of emaciation, fatty stools, and melituria, with epigastric
pain of a neuralgic character, and the discovery of a deep-seated,
dense tumor extending transversely across the epigastrium.The duration is indefinite, and varies greatly with the cause.While a
return to the healthy condition is possible during the early stage of
the lesion, the usual course is similar to that of chronic interstitial
inflammation in other organs.TREATMENT.--The management, when a diagnosis can be made, must be
guided mainly by the etiological indications.The restoration of the
functions of the heart, lungs, or liver when these organs are at fault,
the abstinence from alcohol in the drunkard, and an energetic use of
mercurials or iodide of potassium in syphilis, are of the first
importance in arresting the disease.A persistent course of mild
purgatives and of cathartic mineral waters is serviceable.Pain should
be relieved by belladonna or opium.The diet must be simple and
digestible, and if an arrest of the pancreatic secretion be indicated
by the appearance of fat in the stools, an effort should be made to
supply the deficiency.For this purpose pancreatin, prepared by
precipitation by alcohol from a watery extract of a calf's or pig's
pancreas, may be used.[1] The pancreatin may be given in doses of from
five to fifteen grains, in the form of a pill or in capsules, and at an
interval of two hours after food is taken, or the same quantity of
pancreatin may be added to the food a few moments before it is eaten.Probably the best substitute is a watery infusion of the gland
containing all its soluble principles.To prepare an active infusion
the pancreas must be taken from the animal during the act of digestion.It is then freed from its surrounding fat, and macerated for two hours
in four times its weight of water at a temperature ranging between 25
degrees and 30 degrees C.(58.3 degrees and 61.1 degrees F.).Another
plan is to beat a calf's pancreas in a mortar with six fluidounces of
water until a milk-like fluid is obtained, and strain.One-third of the
infusion obtained by either method is administered after each meal, an
entire pancreas being thus used every twenty-four hours.[Footnote 1: One gramme of pancreatin is sufficient to emulsify fifteen
grammes of fatty substances, to convert eight grammes of starch into
glucose, to digest fifty grammes of fibrin, twenty grammes of
syntonine, and thirty-three grammes of boiled albumen (Raymond).]{1123} The extractum pancreatis,[2] as it is now furnished to the
profession, is a very useful preparation.It may be employed to
peptonize milk, milk-gruel, and broth, or be given in combination with
bicarbonate of sodium at a fixed interval after each meal, as in the
following formula:

  Rx.pancreatis,    drachm j;
      Sodii bicarbonatis, drachm ij;
  M. et.S. One powder to be taken two hours after each meal.[Footnote 2: That prepared by Fairchild Brothers & Foster of New York
has proved the best in my hands.]Peptonized milk is prepared by putting into a clean quart bottle 5
grains of extractum pancreatis, 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
a gill of cool water; shake, and add a pint of fresh cool milk.Place
the bottle in water not so hot but that the whole hand can be held in
it without discomfort for a minute, and keep the bottle there for
exactly thirty minutes.At the end of that time put the bottle on ice
to check further digestion and keep the milk from spoiling.Peptonized milk-gruel is made of equal parts of any farinaceous gruel
and fresh cold milk.To a pint of this combination 5 grains of
extractum pancreatis and 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium are added,
and the whole allowed to stand in a warm place for thirty minutes, when
the process of digestion must be arrested by placing on ice.Peptonized broth is made in the following way: Take one-fourth of a
pound of finely-minced raw lean beef or mutton or chicken, and one-half
pint of cold water; cook over a slow fire, stirring constantly, until
it has boiled a few minutes.Then pour off the liquor, beat the meat to
a paste, and put both into a bottle with a half pint of cold water.Add
30 grains of extractum pancreatis and 20 grains of bicarbonate of
sodium; shake well, and set in a warm place (110-115 degrees) for three
hours, shaking occasionally; then boil quickly.Finally, strain or
clarify in the usual way and season to taste.MORBID GROWTHS OF THE PANCREAS.Cancer is probably the most common of the chronic affections of the
pancreas.It is usually secondary, being due to an extension of
carcinoma of the stomach, duodenum, liver, or abdominal lymphatic
glands, but there are enough cases on record to show that it may be
primary.It has been discovered in the foetus at birth, but the vast
majority of cases occur after the age of forty.Nothing is known as to the influence of inherited
tendency in the production of the disease, and as little of the
exciting causes, though some authors attach much importance to
prolonged pressure upon the epigastrium and to blows and contusions on
the upper part of the abdomen.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--Primary carcinoma may be either {1124}
scirrhous, encephaloid, or colloid, the first being the variety most
frequently observed.The lesion begins in the head of the gland in the form of several small
nodules which gradually coalesce.Sometimes the whole gland becomes
involved in the new formation; again, isolated nodules may be scattered
throughout its substance, and exceptionally the growth is limited to
the tail or middle portion.When the head alone is involved, the
remainder of the gland either remains healthy, undergoes fatty
degeneration, or becomes indurated.The tumor is rounded in outline and
nodular, and varies in size, density, and color according to the form
of carcinoma present.The duct of Wirsung is ordinarily obstructed,
large retention cysts, containing a yellowish-red liquid, are formed,
and the changes already described under the head of Chronic
Interstitial Pancreatitis take place in those portions of the gland
which are free from carcinoma.The disease is very prone to extend to
the surrounding organs, particularly the neighboring lymphatic glands,
the duodenum, and the liver, rarely to the stomach.When the contiguous
organs are not directly implicated in the carcinomatous changes, they
are subjected to pressure by the tumor, and in the case of the stomach
and duodenum adhesions often form, and are followed by perforation.There seems to be a tendency also to infiltration of the adjacent
subperitoneal connective tissue and to hyperplasia of the fibrous
tissue of the viscera, even when they are not secondarily involved in
the morbid growth, leading to narrowing of the aorta, thickening of the
walls of the stomach and duodenum, and a sclerosis of the liver.Obstruction of the common bile-duct, with dilatation of the
gall-bladder from retention of bile, is a frequent result of the
disease.Secondary carcinoma of the pancreas usually first appears in, and is
limited to, the head of the gland.It seldom occurs in isolated
nodules, but the growth is generally continuous with the primary
cancerous mass.The form is either scirrhous or encephaloid.Wagner
records a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma following a simple
epithelioma of the mucous membrane of the duodenum; and a similar
instance has come under the author's own observation;[3] but this
variety of morbid growth is rare.The primary growth is almost
uniformly situated in the stomach, duodenum, liver, or gall-bladder,
though occasionally it may be seated in some distant organ; in such
cases the pancreatic tumor appears as an isolated nodular mass.[Footnote 3: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of
Philadelphia_, vol.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The symptoms may be divided into two
classes--namely, first, those which arise from the lesion of the gland
itself; and, secondly, those which depend upon the effect of this
lesion on the neighboring viscera.The features belonging to the first class are general marasmus, pain,
the appearance of fat and perhaps undigested muscular fibres in the
fecal evacuations and of fat in the urine, and the physical signs of an
abdominal tumor.Loss of flesh is one of the earliest symptoms: it is generally
progressive, and is at times so great that the spine can be distinctly
traced through the abdominal walls.Together with this emaciation there
is debility, often extreme, but sometimes not so marked as might be
expected from the degree of wasting.The skin is commonly pale and dry,
and before jaundice is {1125} developed has the ordinary sallow hue of
cancerous cachexia.The features are pinched, and the face wears an
expression of anxiety and suffering.In cases uncomplicated by
peritoneal inflammation the temperature remains about normal, or it may
be lowered as the general exhaustion increases.The pulse is feeble and
slightly increased in frequency.Pain is the most uniformly present and the earliest symptom.It is
always situated deep in the epigastrium, and from thence extends to the
back, to the right or left side, downward to the umbilicus or lower
part of the abdomen, and upward into the chest.It is generally
continuous, but is subject to remissions and paroxysmal exacerbations.During the remissions sensations of distress, of burning, or of dull
pain are experienced at the pit of the stomach; during the
exacerbations, which may last several days, the pain becomes extremely
acute and lancinating and extended in distribution.The ingestion of
food and pressure upon the epigastrium have no constant effect upon the
pain.Quick movements of the body from side to side often increase it
and excite exacerbations.The suffering is greatest in the erect
posture, and on this account the patient bends his body forward so as
to relax the abdominal muscles.The paroxysmal and neuralgic character
of the pain indicates implication of the coeliac plexus.The appearance of fat in the stools is an important symptom, unless
there be at the same time an obstruction to the passage of bile into
the duodenum, indicated by jaundice.Lipuria has been noticed in a few
cases only.In many instances (nearly one-half of the number of recorded cases)
physical exploration reveals the signs of enlargement of the organ.At
times there is merely a sense of fulness and resistance to the touch,
and a modified tympanitic percussion note in one of the three regions
of the upper segment of the abdomen.But usually when a tumor is
present it is readily mapped out by palpation.The tumor is seated in
the epigastrium, and may extend into the right or left hypochondrium or
downward into the umbilical region.It varies much in size, is rounded,
nodulated, firm, slightly movable or fixed, and tender, though
sometimes painless, to the touch.Percussion yields dulness or a
dull-tympanitic sound.On auscultation a blowing murmur may be heard
when the tumor presses upon the aorta; and when this murmur is present
there is usually also transmitted pulsation.The symptoms belonging to the second class arise when the adjacent
viscera become involved in the cancerous disease, or when their
functional activity is disturbed by the encroachment and pressure of
the enlarged pancreas.From the association of a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane of
the stomach, particularly when the pyloric orifice is obstructed,
several prominent symptoms of gastric catarrh are frequently
observed--namely, sialorrhoea, pyrosis, acid eructations, flatulence,
abnormal sensations, such as burning, weight and oppression in the
epigastrium after taking food, and increased thirst.The tongue varies
in appearance: it may be dry and covered with a brown or yellow fur,
but when the flow of saliva is increased it is peculiarly clean and
moist; and this condition is rather characteristic.The appetite is
also variable; sometimes it remains good {1126} until the end, and
occasionally it is perverted.Hiccough in some cases is an obstinate
and annoying symptom.Nausea and vomiting are late but moderately constant features.Their
relation to the ingestion of food is not fixed.The vomited matter may
consist of food, of glairy mucus more or less tinged with bile, of
colorless liquid, or of a fluid resembling a mixture of bran and water.If there is marked pyloric obstruction with dilatation of the stomach,
large quantities of frothy and fermenting material containing sarcina
ventriculi are rejected at intervals.In the rare cases in which
secondary sarcoma of the viscus is developed the ejecta are bloody or
have the coffee-ground appearance, and the vomiting occurs several
hours after eating, as the new growth is generally situated at the
pylorus.When there is adhesion of the pancreatic tumor to the stomach,
with perforation, both blood and pus are vomited.Dilatation of the
stomach is attended by prominence of the epigastrium and an extended
area of gastric tympany, and in cancer of the pylorus a tumor is often
appreciable on palpation.The fecal
evacuations are hard, and when the biliary secretion is absent from the
intestine they are clay-, and often contain fat.When there is
ulceration of the mucous membrane of the duodenum following secondary
cancer or adhesion, the stools become black and tar-like from the
presence of altered blood.Complete obstipation occurs in mechanical
obstruction of the gut from direct pressure or from bands of lymph.Occasionally, just before death there is diarrhoea, and there may be an
alternation of vomiting and diarrhoea.The symptoms and signs of secondary carcinoma or sclerosis of the liver
may be present, but the most commonly observed indications of impaired
hepatic function depend upon pressure-obstruction of the common
bile-duct.These are jaundice, fatty and clay- stools, and the
appearance of a tumor in the region of the gall-bladder.Jaundice is a
very common symptom.It occurs late in the disease as a rule, is
progressive and persistent, resisting all treatment, and is extreme in
degree, the skin becoming deep-yellow or greenish in color.The tumor
of the distended gall-bladder is pyriform in shape, firm and elastic to
the touch, yields a dull percussion sound, and occupies a position
opposite the extremity of the tenth rib on the right side of the
abdomen.Dropsy occurs in a large proportion of cases (nearly one-half) during
the advanced stages of the disease.It is due to vascular obstruction
occasioned by the pressure of the enlarged pancreas itself or of the
secondarily degenerated coeliac glands, and finally by secondary
lesions of the liver.The dropsy appears either in the form of ascites
or anasarca, is not often extreme in degree, and is subject to
variations, disappearing and reappearing at intervals.Ascites is the
more common form, but both conditions may exist in the same patient.It is impossible in the majority of instances to definitely fix the
date of onset of a pancreatic cancer, but the average duration of the
disease may be stated to be about one year.The uniformly fatal
termination usually takes place slowly from gradual exhaustion or with
the symptoms of an adynamic fever, but death may occur suddenly from
hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The principal features of carcinoma of the pancreas are
extreme emaciation, loss of strength, dyspepsia, pain of a neuralgic
{1127} character in the epigastrium, constipation, obstinate jaundice,
moderate ascites or anasarca, the appearance of fat in the stools,
lipuria, occasional vomiting, and the physical signs of an epigastric
tumor.These symptoms are not pathognomonic, however, and the diagnosis can be
certainly established only when it is possible to exclude primary
disease of the surrounding organs, especially of the stomach and liver.Cancer of the stomach may be excluded by the less-marked character of
the functional disturbances of the viscus; by the absence of frequent
vomiting, haematemesis, and the rejection of coffee-ground material; by
the somewhat different situation and greater immobility of the tumor,
by the seat, distribution, and constancy of the pain; and by the
presence of jaundice and of fat in the stools and urine.Diseases of the liver attended with alterations in the size of the
organ, as cancer, abscess, albuminoid and fatty degeneration, sclerosis
and hydatid tumor, have sufficiently characteristic physical signs and
symptoms to be readily distinguished from cancer of the pancreas.On
the other hand, the tumor of an enlarged gall-bladder is often
confusing.The situation of this tumor opposite the tenth rib and its
pyriform shape are important; other distinguishing points depend upon
the cause of the enlargement.In enlargement from accumulated bile the
tumor is elastic and fluctuating; from accumulation of gall-stones,
hard and nodulated, movable, painless on palpation, and often the seat
of crackling fremitus, produced by manipulation and due to the rubbing
together of several calculi; from cancer, hard, nodular, the size of an
orange, tender on pressure, rapid in growth, preceded by attacks of
biliary colic, and attended by fistulous communications with the
intestines and the passage of gall-stones per anum.In aneurism of the aorta or coeliac axis the tumor may present in the
epigastrium and produce analogous pressure symptoms.But the pain is
more of the character described as wearing, and is usually augmented at
night: on grasping the tumor a uniform expanding pulsation is felt in
place of the to-and-fro movement appreciable in a tumor resting upon a
healthy blood-vessel and receiving a transmitted impulse, while the
constitutional symptoms and course are quite different.The tumor of malignant disease of the omentum, although it appears in
the epigastrium or upper part of the umbilical region, is much more
movable, and is accompanied by ill-defined symptoms very dissimilar to
those of pancreatic cancer.In cancer of the transverse colon the mass may occupy nearly the same
position as a pancreatic growth, but the pain occurs several hours
after food is taken; vomiting is absent, and there is frequently
hemorrhage from the bowels.Chronic pancreatitis is accompanied by symptoms simulating those of
cancer; the enlargement of the gland, however, is not so great, nor are
the indications of pressure upon adjacent organs so prominent.The pain
is less severe, the general failure in health more gradual, the
progress slower, and constipation less common.TREATMENT.--The indications are to maintain the strength of the
patient, to provide a diet that is nutritious and at the same time
easily digested, to allay pain by the employment of narcotics, and to
relieve as far as possible the various symptoms as they arise.The plan
of {1128} administering a calf's pancreas or extractum pancreatis will
prove serviceable when the fecal evacuations contain fat.Nutritious
and peptonized enemata may be of service in some cases.Sarcoma and Tubercle of the Pancreas.Sarcoma of the pancreas occurs with extreme rarity.It is impossible
during life to distinguish it from carcinoma.Tubercle of the gland is infrequently met with.Some pathologists deny
its occurrence, and believe that the cases recorded as such are merely
instances of caseous degeneration of the neighboring glands.When it
does occur, it is always secondary, the primary disease being situated
in the lungs or intestines.The alterations in the gland consist in the
development of cheesy masses or of miliary granulations in the
connective tissue between the acini.The condition gives rise to no
definite symptoms, and its diagnosis during life is impossible.DEGENERATIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Two forms of fatty degeneration occur, either separately or
combined--namely, fatty infiltration and fatty metamorphosis.Fatty infiltration consists of a true hypertrophy of the fat-tissue
normally existing in the gland, or of an increase and extension into
the gland of the peripancreatic adipose tissue.Yellow bands and masses
of fat-tissue appear between the acini, and by constantly increasing in
size lead gradually to a total atrophy of the cells of the acini.The
canal of Wirsung contains a fatty liquid.These changes are found
associated with fatty liver, heart, and omentum, in drunkards
especially.Fatty metamorphosis of the gland consists of a change analogous to
fatty metamorphosis of other organs.When hyperplasia of the
interstitial connective tissue is absent, the organ is flaccid, soft,
and diminished in size; the acinous structure remains distinct, though
the acini and ducts are filled with a fatty emulsion: after this is
discharged or absorbed the gland appears as a flaccid band, and finally
becomes entirely atrophied.Fatty metamorphosis occurs in drunkards, in
diabetes, in advanced age, in cancer, phthisis, and other wasting
diseases.Neither form of fatty disease gives rise to symptoms by which it can be
recognized during life.Albuminoid Degeneration of the Pancreas.This is only found in combination with amyloid change in other organs
of the body, and a diagnosis cannot be made.{1129} Hemorrhages into the Pancreas.Hemorrhages into the pancreas may be divided into three classes.The most common form depends upon passive hyperaemia, the result of
chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, or liver.In this condition the
effusion of blood coexists with chronic inflammatory changes in the
interstitial connective tissue.The appearance at first is of minute
bloody points scattered throughout the areolar tissue; later, these
change into round or oval pigment masses, or spaces containing reddish
serum and surrounded by thickened, rust-, irregular walls.The second class includes the rare cases of hemorrhage resulting from
the rupture of one of the large blood-vessels of the gland, and due to
some pre-existing change in the vessel walls.In these the pancreas is
enlarged, may be converted into a sac containing blood, either fluid or
coagulated or partially crystallized according to the duration of life
after the hemorrhage has taken place, and a ruptured blood-vessel may
be readily discovered on dissection.The condition in which, without any evidence of passive hyperaemia or
gross vascular lesion, the entire pancreas become hemorrhagic,
constitutes the third class.The gland is then dark-red or violet in
color, the meshes of the interstitial tissue are filled with recent or
altered blood, and the acini are stained of a dull-gray hue.The
hemorrhage may extend to the connective tissue surrounding the gland.Finally, the organ becomes soft, the peritoneal covering sloughs, and
fragments of broken-down gland-tissue escape into the peritoneal
cavity.These lesions are so analogous to those which attend thrombosis
occurring in other organs that their dependence upon the same cause
seems probable.The first form of hemorrhage is unattended by special symptoms.In the
second a pulsating tumor may suddenly appear in the epigastrium, and
the ordinary indications of hemorrhage--vomiting, fainting fits, cold
extremities, feeble pulse, and general exhaustion--are present.Death
may occur suddenly or the patient may linger on for months.In the
third condition death usually occurs very suddenly, probably from
pressure upon the sympathetic ganglia.There are no symptoms, and the
rapid termination prevents the development of general peritonitis,
which would otherwise occur from the sloughing of the peritoneum.OBSTRUCTION OF THE PANCREATIC DUCT.Obstruction of the excretory duct is a frequent occurrence in
pancreatic disease, and is due to two classes of causes--namely, 1st,
pressure from without; and, 2d, closure of the canal by catarrhal
swelling of its mucous membrane or by calculi.In the first class may be placed obstruction depending upon contraction
occurring in sclerosis of the gland, upon carcinoma of the head of the
gland, upon peripancreatic adhesions and indurations, upon the {1130}
presence of large gall-stones in the ductus choledochus, and upon
carcinoma of the pylorus and duodenum and enlargement of the
neighboring lymphatic glands.In catarrh of the canal of Wirsung the obstruction results either from
simple swelling of the mucous membrane or from the presence of a plug
of tough mucus.The formation of pancreatic concretions is by no means a rare event,
though these calculi are met with far less frequently than either
gall-stones or salivary concretions.They result from precipitation of
the inorganic ingredients of the pancreatic juice, and are usually
seated in the main duct, although they may be situated in the smaller
branches.They may be single or multiple, as many as twenty having been
counted in one gland.In shape they are spherical, oval, or branched,
with sometimes a smooth, at others a spiculated, surface; their size
varies from that of a minute granule to a small walnut; they are
usually white or grayish-white in color, but may be black; and are
composed of the carbonate of lime or of a combination of the carbonate
and phosphate with oxalate of lime.Coincidently with these calculi it
is common to find concretions in the kidneys and gall-bladder.Concretions composed of insoluble protein substances have also been
found in the pancreatic ducts (Virchow).The most probable causes of the formation of pancreatic calculi seem to
be catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane of the ducts and an
alteration in the chemical composition of the secretion.Whatever the cause, the obstruction, when complete, leads to retention
of the secretion and the formation of retention cysts.When the obstruction is situated at the duodenal extremity of the duct,
the canal and its secondary branches are either uniformly dilated or
sacculi are formed.These sacculi are round or oval, vary greatly in
size, sometimes reaching the dimensions of the fist or of a child's
head; they may be single, or several of them may be present, differing
in size and causing irregular projections of the outer surface of the
gland.When the obstruction occurs at some point in the course of the
duct, the dilatations and sacculi are found only behind the point of
occlusion.The small cysts contain a fluid resembling the pancreatic
juice; the larger, a whitish, chalky fluid, which in old cases may
contain white friable concretions composed of carbonate and phosphate
of lime, and become purulent, or be stained bright red or
chocolate- from the occurrence of hemorrhage.In such instances
haematoidin crystals can be discovered by the microscope.The interior
of the dilated ducts and of the retention cysts is lined by a single
layer of thin flat cells, with irregular edges and with oval flat
nuclei.The walls are thickened, and composed of superimposed layers of
laminated connective tissue separated from one another by flat
nucleated cells.The secreting structure of the gland undergoes atrophy
from pressure, or fatty metamorphosis takes place, and, although the
gland is increased in size from the presence of the cysts, its
functional power is lost.In addition to causing obstruction of the duct of Wirsung and the
changes mentioned, pancreatic calculi may produce induration, atrophy,
acute inflammation, or even suppuration of the surrounding glandular
tissue.{1131} SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The main feature is the presence in the
epigastrium of a rounded, smooth, fluctuating, painless tumor.There
are also indications of the absence of the pancreatic secretion from
the digestive tract--notably, emaciation, general debility, and the
appearance of fat in the stools.Jaundice resulting from a coincident
obstruction of the bile-duct is a frequent symptom, and melituria has
been noted in some cases.It is probable, too, that the passage of a
calculus along the duct may give rise to pain resembling in character
and distribution the pain of hepatic colic.Sometimes the termination is sudden from
the rupture of a cyst into the peritoneal cavity or into the stomach or
duodenum, with hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The absence of pain, of tenderness, and of cachexia,
together with the physical characters of the tumor, distinguishes it
from carcinoma of the gland.Though not likely to be confounded with this disease, both hydatid
tumor of the liver and distension of the gall-bladder must be borne in
mind in making the diagnosis of a fluctuating tumor situated in the
upper third of the abdomen.TREATMENT must be entirely symptomatic.Attention to the general
health, proper regulation of the diet, and the employment of pancreatin
or an infusion of calf's pancreas to supply the place of the deficient
pancreatic juice, are the important steps.Attacks of pancreatic colic
indicate the use of anodynes.In two reported cases in which the cysts were very large paracentesis
for the removal of the fluid contents was resorted to, and there are
two cases on record in which the cysts were extirpated after abdominal
section.Kulenhampff of Bremen records a case of a man, thirty-nine
years of age, in whom, after a succession of severe blows upon the
abdomen, a tumor appeared in the epigastrium.An exploratory incision
was made, and a few ounces of pancreatic fluid evacuated by aspiration.Six days afterward the abdomen was opened, the peritoneum united to the
incision, and antiseptic gauze inserted to produce adhesive
inflammation between the sac and the abdominal wall.Adhesion taking
place after four days, the cyst was opened, a liter of fluid evacuated,
a tent inserted, and an antiseptic dressing applied.For sixteen days
fluid constantly escaped in slowly diminishing quantities, and the
tumor disappeared, a fistulous tract remaining.This completely closed
under the use of tincture of iodine and nitrate of silver at the end of
the seventh week.Thiersch opened a pancreatic cyst and evacuated three
liters of chocolate- fluid; recovery with a fistula followed.From a patient supposed to be suffering from ovarian dropsy Rokitansky
partially extirpated a cyst connected with the tail of the pancreas;
death from suppurative peritonitis occurred on the tenth day.N. Bozeman[4] on December 2, 1880, successfully removed from a woman
forty-one years old a pancreatic cyst weighing, with its contents,
twenty and a half pounds.In this instance also the operation was
undertaken for the removal of a supposed ovarian tumor, the diagnosis
not being established until after the abdomen was opened.[Footnote 4: _New York Medical Record_, Jan.{1132}

PERITONITIS.BY ALONZO CLARK, M.D., LL.D.Italian physicians in the later years of the seventeenth century and in
the early ones of the eighteenth had acquired some knowledge of the
symptoms of the disease we now call peritonitis, but known to them as
inflammation of the intestines.Indeed, it is claimed by some of the
admirers of Hippocrates that there are passages in his writings that
indicate some knowledge of the disease.But this claim will probably be
always received with many doubts as to its validity.In confirmation of the first statement I will transcribe certain
passages from Morgagni's thirty-fifth letter: In inflammation of the
intestines "Albertini had observed the pulse to be low and rather weak,
such as you will find it to have been in general in the foregoing
letter under Nos.He also observed the abdomen to
be tense and hard, the face and eyes to have something unusual in their
appearance."Medical writers, indeed, agree in the tension of the
abdomen, but they add many other symptoms, which prove beyond a doubt
the intestines to be inflamed; yet they mean that evident inflammation
which all may easily ascertain, and not that obscure disorder which we
now speak of, and which few suspect" (gangrene of the intestines)."By
the same writers it is also supposed that there is an obstinate
costiveness and continual vomiting."Morgagni refers to the assistance rendered by Albertini, Valsala, Van
Swieten, Rosa, and others in elucidating this subject.It is singular,
considering the clearness of his perception of the symptoms of
inflammation of the intestines, that he should be so greatly confused
regarding gangrene and sphacelus of the same parts.He looks on these
as the result of inflammation, and when the two classes of cases are
considered and compared, the result is a contrast and not a
resemblance.Yet he supposes that the differences are to be accounted
for by the different modes in which the same disease may be developed
in different persons.Another thing obtrudes itself on the attention in these letters: that
while a number of post-mortem examinations are reported of those who
had died of inflammation of the intestines, of gangrene and sphacelus
of the intestines, of hepatic abscess opening into the peritoneal
cavity, there is no record of finding in the abdomen anything
corresponding to what is now known as the inflammatory effusions from
serous membranes.I have searched his works, not for {1133}
peritonitis, for the word was not in use in his day, but for some
account of inflammation of the intestines or of some disease in the
description of which symptoms are named that distinguish or belong to
peritonitis, and with the single exception of pain the search has been
fruitless.Cullen in 1775 mentions the disease, but says that so little is known
about it that he will not attempt a description of it.Bichat died in 1802 in the thirty-eighth year of his age.I am not able
at present to lay my hand on his _Pathological Anatomy_; I therefore
quote from Chomel's article on peritonitis in the _Dictionnaire de
Medecine_ to show his claim to important studies regarding that
disease: "For a long time peritonitis was confounded under the name of
inflammation du bas ventre with inflammations of the abdominal viscera;
and it is to Bichat belongs the merit of having proved that
inflammation of the peritoneum is a disease distinct, and that it ought
to be separated from enteritis, gastritis, etc., as pleurisy is
separate from pneumonia.The studies of Gasc and of Laennec soon
confirmed the opinion of Bichat, and assured to peritonitis the
important place which it ought to occupy in all nosological tables.It
has become since then a subject of numerous observations and of
interesting researches regarding the causes de sa marche and the
lesions it causes."The references are not given by Chomel, but they are probably these:
Laennec, _Histoire des Inflammations du Peritoine_, 1804; and Gasc,
_Dictionnaire des Sciences Med._, p.Gasc says that the twenty years next preceding his publication
witnessed the first stage of the true history of peritonitis.Walther
in 1786 had contributed some facts, and S. G. Vogel in 1795, but the
rounding off and completing their work was left for Bichat.MORBID ANATOMY.--The first thing that strikes the observer in the
post-mortem examination of a person who has died of this disease is the
tendency of the intestines to protrude through the cut made in the
abdominal wall.This is produced by their dilatation generally, both
small and large, by gas.No gas, under these circumstances, ever
escapes from the peritoneal cavity unless there has been perforation of
the alimentary canal somewhere.While the intestines are in this manner
dilated, the stomach is small and usually empty.On the surface of the intestines there will be found a layer of
coagulated fibrin, often very thin and delicate, requiring a scraping
of the surface of the peritoneum to demonstrate it, but commonly
obvious enough, and sometimes quite abundant.This same false membrane
can be found on the viscera covered by the peritoneal membrane, on its
anterior extension, and most at the point of contact of one coil of the
intestine with another.Incorporated with this new membrane or lying
under it will often be seen blood-spots, thin, translucent, diffused,
and having ill-defined boundaries.The blood-vessels themselves are not remarkably congested.Here and
there may be spots where some redness remains, and the vessels are
larger than natural.But the congestion and redness, which analogy
leads us to {1134} believe belong to the active stages of the disease,
have in great degree disappeared after death.The peritoneal membrane itself has hardly become thickened, certainly
not in marked degree, but it has lost its lustrous surface, is, at
least in parts, of an opaline color, as if it had absorbed diluted
milk, and there is an effusion of serum or slight oedema on its
attached surface.Whatever may be the popular opinion regarding the
termination of inflammation of the bowels in mortification, whatever
the opinion of the older physicians, it is safe to say that gangrene of
the peritoneum has never been the result of uncomplicated, diffuse,
acute peritonitis.Peritonitis from strangulation of the intestine or
analogous causes is of course excepted.But in puerperal peritonitis I
have noticed a fact to which I have nowhere seen an allusion.The
parietal peritoneum is at two points in the abdomen but loosely
attached to the wall.One of these is on the anterior wall, anterior to
and a little above the iliac fossa; the other is above and below the
kidney on each side of the body.In these parts I have seen the
membrane forced off from its attachment to the walls, which with it
made a sac containing pus.Such an abscess, if the patient live long
enough, would doubtless cause the death of the membrane.There is in almost every case of peritonitis more or less of serous
effusion, commonly not seen at first on opening the abdomen, for it has
sunk into the pelvis.It is transparent, of a yellowish hue, and
sometimes flocculi of lymph are found in it.Whether the inflammation of the peritoneum extends to organs covered by
it is a question that has been much discussed; but it is admitted that
these organs, to a shallow depth on their surface, have an unnatural
color; and when it is remembered that the peritoneum is nourished by
vessels not exclusively its own, but running along its attached
surface, and distributed as well to the surface of the organs it
covers, it is easy to admit that to a very limited depth the organs
partake of the inflammatory disease.This supposition gives an easy
explanation of the constipation which is so prominent a feature among
the symptoms of the disease.The manner in which the false membrane is disposed of in those who
recover is an interesting question.Forty or more years ago Vogel
described the process by which the new effusion became a living tissue,
and the manner in which blood-corpuscles and blood-vessels were formed
in it; and another author had found that the time needed to complete
this vascularization was twenty days.But now Bauer and most of the
German writers inform us that the coagulated fibrin is converted into
fatty matter and is absorbed, and that when adhesions occur they result
from the coalescence of a new formation of the connective-tissue
elements built up into granules.The question, then, arises, Will the
chemical constitution of fibrin permit its conversion into oil?If it
will, then the further question presents itself, By what chemical
action is the change effected within the body?I do not intend to
discuss these questions, but propose them by way of expressing some
doubt regarding the accuracy of this statement.I have always supposed that the epithelial layer of the peritoneum was
pushed off by the first of the effusions in peritonitis, and that this
was one of the causes of the lustreless appearance of the membrane.This {1135} opinion I have never attempted to confirm or correct by the
microscope.He says: "The deposition of
fibrin occurs before the endothelium presents any changes.This
fibrinous effusion encloses, primarily, hardly any cellular elements,
and only a few cast-off endothelial cells are to be found in it.The
endothelium itself is swollen and turbid; the cell-body is increased in
size; the contents are granular; multiplication of the nuclei is
apparent; the cells are, in fact, in active division.In the tissue of
the serous membrane itself, soon after the deposition on its surface,
an accumulation of indifferent (?)cells takes place, especially around
the vessels, so that the spaces between the vessels are thus completely
filled up.The fixed connective-tissue corpuscles take part in the
inflammatory process."Delafield says: "If the autopsy is made within a few hours after death,
we find the entire peritoneum of a bright-red color from congestion of
the blood-vessels; but that is all: there is no fibrin, no serum, no
pus; epithelial cells are increased in size and number."For this kind
of peritonitis he proposes the term cellular.He finds it in cases of
local abscess of the abdominal cavity in which inflammatory action has
extended over the whole membrane, and particularly on the omentum also,
in the first two days of puerperal peritonitis."The ordinary form of
acute peritonitis is attended with changes in the endothelium and fixed
connective tissue, and with the production of serum, fibrin, and pus."He describes the migration of white corpuscles of the blood through the
walls of capillaries to become pus-cells, and then says: "Minute
examination shows that two distinct sets of changes are going on at the
same time: first, a production of fibrin, serum, and pus; second,
swelling and multiplication of the endothelial cells.If the
inflammation is very intense, the pus and fibrin are most abundant; if
milder, the changes in the endothelium are more marked."I have said above that the epithelium is early washed off by the
inflammatory effusions.In opposition--or, perhaps better, in
correction--of this idea, Delafield says: "There may be a considerable
amount of pus produced, and yet the layer of endothelium remains in
place.""If, however, the pus and fibrin are produced in large amounts,
the endothelium falls off and leaves the surface of the peritoneum
bare."The connective-tissue cells of peritoneum, he says, undergo but
little change in the first three days of the inflammation, "but by the
seventh day these cells are marked by increase in size and number in
all parts of the peritoneum."Two or three times in my life I have met with a peculiar arrangement of
the false membrane and serum of peritoneal inflammation, of which I do
not remember to have seen a description.It is this: the serum is
enclosed or encysted in bladders, the walls of which are the false
membrane.There may be two or three layers of these bladders, one upon
another, all more or less flattened, and each holding from two to six
ounces of fluid.It would seem that in these cases the inflammatory
activity rose and fell in its progress, early reaching the point at
which coagulable lymph was effused, then falling to the stage in which
serum alone escaped.This serum lifted the false membrane irregularly,
so that several pools were formed.After this the inflammation returns
to the fibrous exudation stage, and gives to these bladders a floor
which blends with the {1136} roof at the edges, and thus makes a
complete sac.Once more the inflammatory action is changed in its
intensity, so that the only effusion is serum; and this serum again
raises the new layer of false membrane into bladders--not always or
generally in the exact position of the first series.Still again, the
inflammation may be so changed as to make a fibrinous flow to this
second series of bladders.I am not certain that I have seen a third
series of these rare productions.They have doubtless been seen by
other persons, and may have been described.I have not been an
exhaustive reader on the subject, but I can well understand how they
may have been called hydatids on examination of the sacs without
looking at the contents.The fluid in the cysts is simply serum, with
no echinococcus sacs, and then the number of these inflammatory sacs
greatly exceeds the probable number of the fibrous sacs of hydatids.Pus in large quantity is not often a product of simple acute diffusive
peritonitis, although it is frequently found in that form of the
disease that attends puerperal fever, septicaemia, or erysipelas.Yet I
have seen it a few times.The pus is not generally pure, but is mixed
with serum in different proportions, and there will be seen at the same
time deposits of lymph attached to the peritoneum or scales of it
floating in the fluid effusion, or both.There is reason to believe
that in the cases of this class a very large proportion are fatal in
the acute stages, but in the cases that live for a few weeks the pus is
disposed to collect in pools and become abscesses by adhesions around
them at their borders.These abscesses are disposed to find an exit
from the body.In one case four abscesses that were found in this way
in different parts of the abdominal cavity had each burrowed toward the
umbilicus, and were actually discharging their contents at this point
when I saw the case.In another case one abscess only was formed, and
in four weeks it had perforated the colon.The opening was nearly an
inch in diameter.Kalantarians says, in eight examinations of the solar and hypogastric
plexus in persons who had died of acute peritonitis changes which he
regards as inflammatory had occurred, with subsequent opaque swelling
of the nerve-cells, ultimate fatty degeneration, brown pigmentation,
and atrophy.In chronic peritonitis the cells are often converted into
amorphous pigment matter, with increase and sclerosis of the ganglionic
connective tissue.Still, it is worthy of notice that these changes do
not express themselves in symptoms in those that recover.ETIOLOGY.--Numerous writers have expressed a doubt whether a
spontaneous acute peritonitis ever occurs, or if it is ever primary its
occurrence in this way is very rare.Habershon[1] has presented the
case with more apparent force than any other writer.He studied the
record of five hundred autopsies of peritonitis made at Guy's Hospital
during twenty-five years, but he "cannot find a single case thoroughly
detailed where the disease could be correctly regarded as existing
solely in the peritoneal serous membrane."[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chirurgical Trans._, vol.In twenty-five years
the records were probably made by a number of different persons, and
persons of varying views and varying capacity and judgment.It is
possible that the quotation may embrace some of the changes already
referred to as the consequences of peritonitis.It does embrace the
cases {1137} "when inflammation of the serous membrane occurs in the
course of albuminuria, pyaemia, puerperal fever, erysipelas, etc."It
also includes "peritonitis caused by general nutritive changes in the
system," as seen "in struma, cancer, etc.," "comprising also those
cases in which the circulation of the peritoneum has been so altered by
continued hyperaemia (modifying its state of growth) that very slight
existing causes suffice to excite mischief, as in peritonitis with
cirrhosis, disease of the heart, etc."With these explanations the statement differs widely from what it would
seem to mean without them.It is far from saying that peritonitis
always follows some abdominal lesion and is caused by that lesion.Habershon's paper was published twenty-three years ago, and during all
these years the curative treatment of peritonitis, to which the paper
itself gave currency, has enabled us to study our cases after recovery
as well as before the sickness, and it can hardly be doubted that a
much larger proportion of the cases are primary and idiopathic than
either Louis or Habershon found reason to admit.That a large number
are produced by preceding lesions and constitutional conditions no one
will be likely to doubt.Among the 500 post-mortem examinations of peritonitis reported by
Habershon, he found preceding disease or injury recognizable in the
abdominal cavity in 261.:

  From hernia, of which 19 were internal obstruction.35
  From perforation of the stomach, ileum, caecum and appendix,
    colon, etc.(other 13 mentioned with hernia, or with caecal
    disease).43
  And leading to fecal abscess (2 otherwise mentioned).17
  From typhoid ulceration without perforation .5
  From disease or operation on bladder and pelvis, viscera, etc.42
  From disease of the liver and gall-bladder.11
  From acute disease of the colon (3 others enumerated with
    perforation).3
  From disease of the caecum or appendix (9 others previously
    mentioned).3
                                                                   ---
                                                                   261

Habershon says that in the (his) second and third divisions of the
cases the causes were as follows:

  From Bright's disease .63
  From pyaemia, 13; erysipelas, 5; puerperal fever, 10; with
    pneumonia, 3.31
  From strumous disease .9
                                                                   ---
                                                                   240

I have drawn thus liberally from Habershon's paper because it is the
only paper that I know, in any language, founded on the analysis of a
large number of cases (for five hundred post-mortem examinations is a
large number for a disease no more frequent than peritonitis), in the
belief that he dealt with facts and that his conclusions must be of
great value.He may differ with other physicians regarding what
constitutes strumous disease and in the agency of heart disease.He may
have mistaken coincidence for consequence, but the paper bears the
marks of honesty and good faith from the beginning to the end.In Habershon's second division, under which he ranks the cases of
{1138} peritonitis caused by "a changed condition of the blood," he
ascribes 63 to albuminuria.Every physician knows how often meningitis
or pericarditis or pleurisy may occur under these circumstances,
especially in young persons; but, for myself, I cannot but express
surprise at these figures.In one capacity or another I have been
connected with large hospitals for forty-eight years, and have seen
many cases of albuminuria in private practice, and can recall but few
instances in which kidney disease, excepting cancer and other tumors,
has terminated in peritonitis.In modification of this statement,
however, it is proper to add that the hospital physician cannot know
how half the diseases he treats terminate, on account of the American
plan of interrupted service, and even less can he know of the mode of
death in cases which he sees in consultation.Even with this admission,
from my standpoint it is not easy to believe that one-eighth of the
cases of peritonitis are caused by albuminuria.The word pyaemia used by Habershon, it seems to me, ought to be
replaced by septicaemia, and it has been by many of the profession.Sedillot many years ago proved that laudable pus injected into the
blood-vessels of the dog produced no signs of disease, but that septic
pus, so used, was followed by grave symptoms, even death.Among the
author's cases thirteen were associated with the septic poison.He also
found five which he thinks were independent of erysipelas.One in one
hundred is a proportion hardly large enough to establish the relation
of cause and effect against the chances of concurrence.I can make a remark with reference to the inquiry by C. Dubacy in the
October number (1881) of the _American Journal of Medical Sciences_,
whether diphtheria produces peritonitis.When diphtheria became
epidemic among us in 1860 or 1861 for several years, I saw a great deal
of it, but did not recognize any relation between it and peritonitis.The relations of hernia, injuries, and operations to peritonitis need
no commentary.Perforations of the alimentary canal may require some illustrative
statements.These occur most frequently in the vermiform appendix of
the caecum, and are almost invariably caused by some irritating
substance imprisoned in its tube.In some cases it is a seed of some
fruit, as the orange or lemon; in others, a cherry-pit; in one that I
remember it was a small stone, such as is sometimes found in rice; in
others, a hard fecal concretion; in one, a child, a singular formation:
a strawberry-seed was the centre; around this a layer of fecal matter,
around the fecal matter a calcareous layer, on this, again, a fecal
layer, and so on to the number of six layers, the external one being
calcareous.This body was about one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and
may have been years in forming.In this connection I may state, per
contra, that I am informed that in a pathological museum in Boston is
preserved an appendix that contains, and did contain, a large number of
bird-shot, which did no mischief except to enlarge the appendix.This
was from the body of a man who had shot and eaten many birds.My
observation has led me to the belief that a large proportion of the
cases of peritonitis occurring in children are due to perforation of
the appendix.Of the diseases of the liver producing acute diffuse peritonitis, the
foremost, I think, is abscess, single or multiple.The different modes
in which gall-stones may produce it may be illustrated by the following
{1139} cases: (1) A lady died of acute peritonitis.At post-mortem
examination a large abscess was found, bounded above by the liver, in
other directions by adherent intestines; it contained nearly a quart of
pus: at the bottom of the sac was a single gall-stone, very large and
very black; the gall-bladder was perforated and very much shrunken.The
gall-stone had caused an ulceration of the gall-bladder, but none of
the intestines, in this respect differing from the process known as
painless transit of a gall-stone.So the calculus caused the abscess,
and the abscess caused the general peritonitis.(2) A lady between
fifty and sixty years of age had an attack of gall-stone pains; she had
had them before.In a few hours symptoms of peritonitis were manifest,
and she died.The post-mortem examination showed the ductus cysticus
was ulcerated and perforated.Two gall-stones of large size had been
formed in the gall-bladder, and had been pushed forward into the duct
about halfway to the common duct, leaving it enlarged as they advanced.The foremost one had caused an ulcer on the anterior or lower side of
the duct, and bile had escaped, staining all the right half of the
abdominal cavity, and throughout this half only the parts were covered
with false membrane and stained with bile.John Freeland of Antigua had a
patient, a <DW52> woman sixty-five years of age, who had been
suffering from intermittent fever, gastric disorder, and retching.In
one of the vomiting spells she experienced great pain, which, being
relieved by an opiate, soon returned and was attended by tympanitic and
tender abdomen.The
cavity of the abdomen was found filled with blood and bile, the
intestines inflamed and gangrenous in spots, and there was general
peritonitis.The gall-bladder was empty; the hepatic duct was
lacerated, and contained pouches in which gall-stones were encysted.This laceration was surrounded by
evidences of recent inflammation, and caused the general
peritonitis.[2]

[Footnote 2: The _Medical Record_, Dec.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have been attended by
little inflammation of the peritoneum.Death has followed this accident
in twenty to thirty-six hours.There has been little pain, little
tumefaction of the bowels, little tenderness, but a sense of sinking
and a peculiar feeling at the stomach which the patient finds it
difficult to describe.The ulcers of dysentery do at times perforate all the coats of the
colon, and yet do not with any uniformity cause general peritonitis;
but as the destructive process approaches the outer covering the latter
becomes inflamed, and lymph enough is effused to close the opening and
prevent the escape of the contents of the intestine; so that, while
perforation is not uncommon, I have rarely seen diffuse peritonitis
accompanying dysentery.Habershon reports 5 cases in which incomplete typhoid ulcers of the
intestines caused peritonitis, and 15 from the complete perforation.I
believe that the physicians of this country and those of France have
found the complete perforation much the most common.I do not remember to have seen fecal accumulation in the intestines
produce peritonitis at all general.I did see, years ago, a man of
middle {1140} age in whom fecal impaction in the ascending colon had
caused destruction of all the layers of the abdominal wall on the right
side, so that the contents of the intestine were exposed to view in a
space of three inches by two.This implies that there had been
peritoneal inflammation enough to seal the intestine to the abdominal
wall on all the borders of this extraordinary ulcer.The man recovered
in about six months, and returned to his business.The inconsiderable operation of tapping for abdominal and ovarian
dropsy has sometimes been followed by acute peritonitis.In the early
part of my professional life I met with several such cases, and have
witnessed the same from time to time since.These were mostly cases of
dropsy from cirrhosis of the liver.Habershon found 5 such cases, and 7
in the tapping of ovarian cysts.The rupture of ovarian cysts has produced peritonitis, but in a larger
number of cases such rupture, even when the result of violence, has not
led to inflammation; but the kidney secretion has been greatly
augmented and the fluid absorbed, so that the rupture has been
beneficial rather than harmful.Tumors, particularly those of a malignant character, are apt to grow to
the surrounding structures by adhesions the result of chronic
inflammation, but now and then they provoke an acute attack which
becomes general.Benign tumors may, in rare instances, do this.In one
case a man died of acute peritonitis, and the examination showed that a
tumor noticed before death, a very large serous cyst standing out of
the left kidney, downward-forward, was the only lesion that antedated
the inflammation.Infiltration of urine, in any of the several ways in which it can reach
the peritoneum, is a cause of peritonitis.Pelvic cellulitis may also
be a cause, though twenty or thirty cases in succession may run a
favorable course with no secondary lesions; it is still recognized as
one of the occasional causes of peritonitis.Among the rare causes of diffusive peritonitis is perforation of the
intestine by lumbricoid worms.In such cases the product of the
inflammatory action is apt to be sero-purulent, with but a limited
amount of fibrin.E. Marcus reports such a perforation, and it was
called by Peris ascaridophagie.The worms were apparently not found in
the peritoneal cavity, but in the intestines.The perforation had
bloodless edges, which lay quite close upon one another, as if they had
been separated by a piercing action of the attenuated extremity of the
parasite not eaten through.[3]

[Footnote 3: _N.Y.Lusk finds that certain vaginal injections excite a local peritonitis.Sentey gives the details of a case in which a midwife undertook to
procure an abortion by the douche.She used a tube that was large with
a spreading mouth or opening, which probably received the neck of the
uterus in such a way as to prevent the return of the water.It was, in
consequence, forced into the uterus and through one of the Fallopian
tubes into the peritoneal cavity.By this a rapidly-fatal peritonitis
was developed.It would seem that
this mode of procuring abortion can be frightfully misused, however
safe it may be in skilful hands.There is a word still to be said regarding the difference between
peritonitis produced by wounds, operations, violence, and internal
growths, or {1141} what, with a little liberty, may be called traumatic
causes, and that which arises spontaneously or without recognizable
cause.The first shows a tendency to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of the injury, and more frequently does not become
general; while the latter spreads pretty quickly over the whole extent
of the peritoneum.SYMPTOMS.--There is, perhaps, no grave disease whose symptomatology is
more easily interpreted, in which the diagnosis is more easily made,
than the average case of acute diffuse peritonitis.Yet there are
obscure cases which it is difficult to recognize.In a well-marked case the first symptom is pain.Chomel and even some
later writers believe that chill precedes the pain, but to the best of
my recollection it has not generally so occurred to me; and the
question arises, Have they kept the symptoms of puerperal peritonitis
separated from those of simple peritonitis?The pain is first felt in a somewhat limited space in the abdomen, and
pretty rapidly spreads, so that it is soon felt in every part of the
bowels.It may remain greatest in the part where it first began, but
there are many exceptions to this statement.As the disease advances
the pain and tenderness become more marked, and the patient will try to
diminish the tension of the abdominal walls by lying on his back and by
bending the hip- and knee-joints, often also for the additional purpose
of lifting the bedclothes from his abdomen.Often the patient will
resist the physician's movement to examine his bowel with the hand.In
the last few hours of life the pain ceases.The pulse in its frequency follows the advances in the disease.At the
onset it is not much accelerated, but in two or three hours it may
reach 100 to 120 in the minute.Besides becoming more frequent, it
becomes smaller in volume and more tense.Toward the end of a fatal
case it may reach 140 to 160 in the minute and be very small.In the early hours of peritonitis the bowels begin to swell, and
percussion shows that the swelling is caused by gaseous accumulation.This increases as the disease goes on, so that in some the bowels
become greatly distended--so much, indeed, as to diminish the thoracic
space and interfere with the respiration.As the disease advances the
tympanitic resonance may give place to dulness on percussion on the
sides and lower part of the abdomen.Before the introduction of opium in the treatment of peritonitis the
green vomit was a marked feature of the disease.It occurs in other
conditions, but rarely, and its occurrence in this disease was so
common that it was regarded as almost diagnostic.The fluid vomited is
of a spinach-green color, and the color is probably derived from the
bile; at least, I have examined it repeatedly for the blood-elements,
and have not found them.In these days this symptom of peritonitis is
not often observed.Constipation is absolute in uncomplicated peritonitis of ordinary
severity, and I believe is caused by a temporary paralysis of the
muscular layer of the intestine.It has already been stated that the
blood-supply of the peritoneum is through vessels whose capillaries are
shared by that membrane and the tissues which it covers.Inflammatory
action in the peritoneum of average severity would naturally extend to
this muscular layer and render it inactive.When the inflammation
abates it recovers its contractile power.Thus, the intestines become
entirely insensitive to {1142} cathartic medicines.This fact is not
observed in puerperal peritonitis, probably because the large share
which the uterus takes of the disease may act, in some degree, as a
derivative; and then, so far as I know, the muscular layer of the
intestines does not undergo the change of color and appearance in the
latter disease that has been observed in the former.This obstinate
constipation has been noticed from the first discovery of the disease,
and during forty years in the first part of this century many
physicians believed that if they could overcome it their patients would
recover.The present interpretation of this conviction is that if
catharsis, which was very rarely effected, did precede recovery, the
disease was not of a grave type--if, indeed, it was peritonitis at all.Sometimes peritonitis occurs in the course of a diarrhoea; then the
constipation is not at once established, but the symptoms of the two
diseases concur for one or two days, when the diarrhoea ceases.Abdominal respiration ceases when peritonitis is established, either
because the movements of the diaphragm produce pain or because the
diaphragm is partly paralyzed, as is the muscle of the intestines.Then
the gaseous distension of the bowels obstructs the action of this
muscle.As a clinical fact it is important, and has often helped me in
a diagnosis.Another kindred fact is that all the indications of
peristaltic action cease.I have a great many times placed my hand on
the abdomen and patiently waited for a sensation that would be evidence
of intestinal movements, but did not discover any--have placed my ear
on the surface of the abdomen, and have long listened for the gurgling
which is so constant in healthy bowels, and have listened in vain.In
this respect my observations differ from those of Battey, who reports
that he has heard the friction of the newly-made false membrane in
respiration, while I concur with him in the statement that the
sensation of friction can be felt by pressure of the ends of the
fingers into the abdominal wall so as to produce indentation.It should
be said regarding the friction sound in respiration that Battey has the
support of Chomel, and he in his turn quotes Barth and Roger; so that
there may be in this sign more than I have thus far found.The temperature of the body is not, considering the extent of membrane
involved, remarkably high.I have recently attended a most
carefully-observed case in which the temperature never rose above 104
degrees F. It falls below the temperature of health as the disease
approaches a fatal termination.From the time this disease was recognized as a separate and distinct
affection the countenance has fixed the attention of writers.The face
is pale and bloodless and the features pinched, and the general
expression is one of anxiety and suffering.I do not remember to have
seen a flushed face in peritonitis, although the degree of paleness
differs in different patients.The mind is almost always clear, unless disturbed by the medicines used
in the treatment.Yet cases are recorded in which a mild, and still
more rarely a violent, delirium has been noticed.Subsultus tendinum,
and even convulsions, have been witnessed, but whether these symptoms
belong to the peritonitis or to an accompanying uraemia has not
received the attention of those who have witnessed them.The urine is usually scanty and high-, but it does not often
{1143} contain either albumen or casts.This statement is presumably
untrue of the cases in which Bright's disease preceded the peritonitis
and is supposed to be the cause of it--a variety of the disease with
which I have already declared my scanty acquaintance.The urine is
often voided with difficulty, and sometimes retained, so that resort to
a catheter becomes necessary.The symptoms of this disease are not invariable.In one case the
inflation of the bowels is only enough to be perceptible; in another,
as I have said, it becomes a distressing symptom, while in most the
bowels are obstinately constipated.A case may now and then occur in
which evacuations can be procured by cathartics.Pain is regarded by
all physicians as the most constant symptom, and it has existed in
every case that I have seen, or at least tenderness; but the late
Griscom stated to me that a man once came to his office for advice in
whom he suspected peritonitis; but the man asserted that he had no
pain, and the doctor placed his fist on the abdominal wall and pushed
backward till he was resisted by the spinal column, the man asserting
that the pressure did not hurt him; yet he died the next day, the
doctor declared, of peritonitis.This may be credible in view of the
fact that absence of pain in puerperal peritonitis is not very
uncommon.The green vomit, which was expected in all cases forty years
ago, for the most part, as I have intimated, disappears under the opium
treatment.There are persons in whom peritonitis does not accelerate
the pulse beyond 100 beats in the minute.The pain, in rare cases,
remits and recurs with some degree of regularity, in this respect
resembling intestinal colic.Andral reports such a case; I have also
witnessed it.MORTALITY.--Up to the time when the opium treatment was adopted,
peritonitis was a fearful word; a large proportion of those attacked by
it died of it.In 1832, I began to visit hospitals as a medical
student, and for eight years, at home or abroad, was almost a daily
attendant.The number of recoveries of those that I saw in that time
can be counted on the fingers of one hand.This may be regarded as its
natural mortality, for the treatment of that day seemed to exercise
little or no control over it.(Farther on this matter will be referred
to again.)DURATION.--Chomel believed that the disease might prove fatal in
eighteen hours, while he regards its average duration as seven or eight
days.I very much doubt whether peritonitis, not caused by perforation,
violence, or surgical operation, was ever fatal in eighteen hours.I do
not remember any case of shorter duration than two or three days.Then,
on the other hand, the period of seven or eight days in the fatal cases
appears to me too long.In the early part of my professional life I
remember to have looked for death in three or four days.At present, in
the fatal cases, life is prolonged to double or more than double that
time.In the majority of those that recover at present the duration of
the symptoms is from two days to a week; in a few they have continued
fourteen days; and lately I have assisted in the treatment of a case in
which there was little amelioration for forty days, and yet the
peritonitis was cured.DIAGNOSIS.--When the symptoms are fully developed there are few
diseases that are more easily recognized.It is when these symptoms are
slowly or irregularly manifested, or when some other disease which may
account for many of the symptoms occurs with it or precedes it, that
there {1144} should be any real difficulty.It is customary to regard
the danger of confounding the transit of a renal or hepatic calculus
with peritonitis as worthy of comment.But if the reader will turn to
the articles in this work which relate to these topics, he will find
the symptoms so widely different from those enumerated in this article
as belonging to peritonitis that he will be surprised that this item in
the diagnosis should have occupied so much room.In a case already referred to, in which peritonitis followed gall-stone
pains, the transition was so marked by the rapid acceleration of the
pulse and swelling of the abdomen that each of the three physicians in
attendance at once appreciated the significance of the change.A
physician who resided in the country called on me to report his own
case.He had a little before had a very painful affection of the
abdomen which continued for three days.The pain was paroxysmal,
confined to the region of the liver, back and front, for one day; after
that there was some tenderness over most of the abdomen, but no
tympanitis.His pulse became frequent and his temperature advanced to
103 degrees.His physicians believed that these symptoms justified them
in treating him for peritonitis.Yet his position in bed was constantly
changed, and no one attitude long continued--a restlessness which never
occurs in peritonitis, but is common in calculus transits.Add to this
the absence of gaseous distension and of the green vomit, the
paroxysmal character of the pain (though I remember one case in which
peritoneal pain increased and diminished somewhat regularly, but only
one), and, finally, the sudden cessation of the pain, such as often
happens in calculus transit when the calculus passes into the
intestine,--it is plain that his sufferings were caused by a
gall-stone.The elevation of temperature was the result of a
long-continued worry of the nervous system, and the abdominal
tenderness came from the many times repeated contraction of the
abdominal muscles which occurs in hepatic colic.And then, to make the
diagnosis more complete, this gentleman, after twelve or fourteen hours
of pain, became jaundiced--in the end very much so.There was no
absolute constipation, and the stools were of the color of clay from
the absence of bile.The points of difference between renal colic and peritonitis are even
better defined and easier recognized than those between it and hepatic
colic.In intestinal colic there may be some inflation of the bowels, and if
it continues a day or two there may be some tenderness; but it is for
the most part distinguished from peritonitis by the intermittent or
remittent character of the pain, by its greater severity while it
lasts, by its courting, rather than repulsing, pressure, by the
moderate acceleration of the pulse, by no or only slight elevation of
temperature (exception being made for long continuance), by the absence
of the green vomit, by the absence of the fixed position of
peritonitis, etc.There does not seem to me any need of spending time to distinguish
gastritis or enteritis or neuralgia from peritonitis, their symptoms
are so wholly different; and if, as is said, the mucous inflammation
can penetrate all the coats of the stomach or intestine, and so cause
inflammation of the peritoneal layer, that is peritonitis, and will be
distinguished by the proper symptoms of peritonitis.TREATMENT.--Chomel[4] says: "If general peritonitis is intense, it
{1145} should be attacked by the most powerful therapeutic agents.One
should immediately prescribe a large bleeding from the arm--from 500 to
600 grammes, for example--and repeat according to the need once or even
twice in the first twenty-four hours; apply to the abdomen, and
particularly to the part of it where the pain was first felt, leeches
in large number--fifty, even a hundred--as the violence of the disease
may demand and the strength of the patient will permit."He recommends
baths, presumably tepid, and describes an apparatus by which the
patient can be put into the bath and lifted out of it without pain;
prescribes a fixed posture, gentle laxatives, mercurial frictions,
blisters; conditionally and doubtfully, paracentesis, emetics under
certain circumstances--musk, etc.In the treatment of
general peritonitis there is no reference to opium.The word does not
occur, but it does in the treatment of peritonitis following
perforation.In this condition he would, among other things, give opium
a haute dose, but he does not prescribe any repetition or give any
details.It is probable that the idea was obtained from Graves, whose
first use of opium in this accident was in 1821, although its first
publication appears to have been by Stokes in 1832.[Footnote 4: _Dictionnaire de Medecine_, 1841.]Wardell,[5] who has written the latest treatise on the disease we are
considering, relies greatly on bloodletting, but falls short of Chomel
in the quantity of blood he would take--would bleed, not to withdraw a
certain number of ounces, but to produce certain effects.The
venesection is to be followed by the application of leeches--twenty,
thirty, or forty--to the abdomen; after this turpentine applications to
the bowels.After depletion, he says, opium should be given at once:
"two or three grains may be given in urgent cases."Vesication he calls
"another of our aids."He disapproves of cathartics, but when there is
accumulation in the colon would use injections."Opium in the asthenic
form is the chief agent, and Graves and Stokes were among the first
physicians who gave it very largely.""Two or three grains may at first
be prescribed, and a grain every four or three, or even two, hours
afterward.""In perforation there is sometimes great toleration of the
drug.Murchison has known so large a quantity as sixty grains to be
given in three days with impunity."Mercurials, he thinks, are of
doubtful efficacy.In the paragraph devoted to the treatment of
puerperal peritonitis the word opium does not occur, and it is only by
a very doubtful inference that we can assume that he would ever use it.Chomel makes no allusion to the use of opium in the same disease.[Footnote 5: _Reynolds's System of Medicine_.]For two years (1834-36) I was connected with the New York Hospital as
house-physician or in positions by which that office is reached.The
treatment of acute diffuse peritonitis then and there was formulated as
follows: First, a full bleeding from the arm, commonly sixteen ounces,
then a dozen or more leeches to the abdomen; following this, another
bleeding or not, in the discretion of the physician.Meantime, the
patient would take half a grain to a grain of calomel every two hours,
with a little opium "to prevent the calomel acting on the bowels," of
which there was no danger, in truth.Mercurial inunction was used at
the same time.The belief was that after depletion the most important
thing was "to establish mercurial action in the system;" in other
words, {1146} "to diminish the plasticity of the blood."Under this
plan I saw one recovery in these two years.In 1840, I went to Vermont to give a course of lectures in the Vermont
Medical College, and while there was called by the physicians to see
with them several cases of peritonitis.I found that they were treating
the disease on the Armstrong plan; that is, bleeding freely, and then
administering a full dose of opium, as they said, "to prolong the
effects of the bleeding."In most cases there was a second bleeding and
a second administration of opium.Leeches were also used, and
irritating applications to the abdomen, and in some cases purges.I
found they were getting better results than we were in New York, and I
studied their cases as closely as I could, and reached the conclusion
that opium was the curative agent, and that it would be safe to omit
the abstraction of blood.This conviction grew in strength with every
new case, and I saw, with different physicians, several cases, the
disease being more prevalent among the mountains there than in the
city--at least that year.The idea then formed was that to establish
the narcotic effects of opium within safe limits, and continue them by
repeated administration of the drug, would cure uncomplicated
peritonitis--that a kind of saturation of the system with opium would
be inconsistent with the progress of the inflammation, and would subdue
it.There was no theory to build the treatment on, and no explanation
of the action of the drug in my mind.What I saw of the action of two
full doses of opium was the only foundation for the idea.I had in the
course of two years after those observations in Vermont 9 cases of
general acute peritonitis, 8 of which were cured.All these were
reported in succession, as they occurred, to the medical societies and
in my college lectures.The plan was adopted by many members of these
societies and by others with whom I had opportunity of conversing on
the subject, so that soon there were several--I may say many--workers
in the field; and in all instances where the practitioner had the
courage to carry out the treatment favorable reports were returned.Not
that every case of peritonitis was cured, but the recoveries generally
exceeded those that followed any other plan ever before used.No
physician tried it with a proper understanding of its details, and with
courage to execute them, who if living does not practise it to-day.The treatment of puerperal peritonitis is not allotted to me, and I am
very reluctent to encroach in any degree on the province of the very
competent and highly-esteemed gentleman to whom that disease was
assigned.But the history of the opium treatment is very incomplete
without the statement I am about to make, and I trust to his generosity
to forgive this encroachment; and all the more confidently because he
was not at the time acquainted with the manner in which opium was first
introduced into the treatment of puerperal fever.After the curative action of the drug was demonstrated in general
peritonitis, I was anxious to try it in puerperal fever, of which
peritonitis forms a part.But I had no hospital and no obstetrical
practice.In 1847, I was appointed one of the physicians to Bellevue
Hospital, to which an obstetrical department was attached.After one or
two years a single case occurred and was sent to my division.I gave
her 100 grains of opium in four days, with more or less of calomel--I
have {1147} forgotten how much.She recovered, but after the symptoms
of puerperal fever passed away she had secondary abscesses of the
lungs.In 1840 there was a very fatal visitation of puerperal fever in this
hospital, and on invitation of Vache, who then had charge of the whole
institution, I was a daily visitor and took notes of all the cases.It
was from these notes that Vache compiled his report of the epidemic
published in the _Medical and Surgical Journal_.The disease was
fearfully fatal, although every known mode of treatment was tried in
different cases, including Brenan's plan by turpentine, but all, with
one or two exceptions, with the same result.At this time the opium
plan was on its trial, and I had not acquired a confidence in it that
authorized me to try it in these cases.One woman was sent to me in
whom the disease was well advanced.I instructed my house-physician not
how much opium to give, but what effects to produce by it.I found this
woman dying the next day, and that she had taken only three grains of
opium in three doses.In three or four days seven cases were sent me
from the lying-in wards.One was returned for error in diagnosis, and
six put under treatment.Having found that prudence in my
house-physician was so much more conspicuous than courage, another
house-officer, who combined them both, was selected to be in almost
constant attendance.The instruction I gave him was in these words: "I
want you to narcotize those women to within an inch of their lives."He
did it, and saved every one of them.This gentleman is now known over
the whole land as a learned and distinguished surgeon.I feel called
upon to give his name in this connection, that he may be a witness to
the facts I state, and for the admiration with which his nerve and
prudence impressed me.One of these patients took first two grains,
then three grains, then four, and so on till she took twelve grains of
opium at a dose, the intervals being two hours.The state into which
the patient was to be brought I have denominated a state of
semi-narcotism.The quantity of the drug necessary to produce this
state varied surprisingly in different persons.One of these women was
pretty fully narcotized by four grains every two hours.She was watched
with anxiety; restoratives were kept in readiness, but nothing was done
but to suspend the administration of the medicine and to wait.In seven
hours the consciousness was fully restored, and the improvement in her
condition was wonderful.But in a few
hours more the symptoms recurred, and the same medicine was again given
in three-grain doses, and again narcotism was produced.Taught by the
experience of the day before, we waited, and when she recovered from
this second narcotism her disease was completely cured.She took no
more medicine of any sort.This case was very instructive, as it taught
me that over certain cases of puerperal fever opium has absolute
control.From the time here referred to, so long as the obstetrical service was
maintained at Bellevue Hospital, a large proportion of cases of this
fever, as they occurred, were sent to my wards, and in all these years
I have not lost faith in opium.This statement, however, requires an
explanation.Puerperal fever is a compound disease.Its great
inflammatory lesions are found in the uterus and its appendages and in
the peritoneum.{1148} When the inflammation of the uterus is the
dominant lesion, and is purulent, opium has little or perhaps no
control over its fatality; but in the cases in which peritonitis is the
ruling lesion, if begun early, it will show its power.In this
connection I will only add that in private practice the drug has been
perhaps more curative than in the hospital.I have seen many cases in
consultation, and a decided majority have recovered.In some instances
the patient has fallen into a pleasant sleep, only broken by some
administration, and ending with her recovery.In one instance a very
eminent physician had undertaken to treat a case by the opium plan, but
he had administered the drug so timidly that for fourteen days he had
done no more than hold the disease in check.After trial, I found that
I could not induce him to give the drug in my way, and I asked him to
give me sole charge of the patient for twenty-four hours.To this he
assented, remarking, "If you cure her, doctor, I will have it announced
to the profession that she was the sickest person I ever saw get well."In half the time allowed me I was able to establish the opium symptoms
as given farther on, and the lady slowly recovered.The treatment of any form of peritonitis by opium permits the use of
the drug itself, or of any extract or preparation of it which contains
its narcotic qualities, but it is wise to persevere with that one first
chosen unless there is strong reason for a change.This caution is
based on the fact that we cannot change from one to another and be
certain to obtain the same drug activity.For example, we begin with
laudanum, and find what it will do.We cannot take in its place the
sulphate of morphia with the certainty that we can so graduate it as to
get precisely the same effects.Then the quantity which will be
effectual in one case may be quite inadequate for the next.The
tolerance of opium in different persons varies remarkably, and probably
the disease itself increases the tolerance in all.This will be
illustrated by some of the details of this paper.The drug symptoms to be produced are as follows: Subsidence or marked
diminution of the pain; some or considerable tendency to sleep;
contraction of the pupils; reduction of the breathing to twelve
respirations in the minute; in the favorable cases a considerable
reduction in the frequency of the pulse; a gentle perspiration; an
itchy state of skin, or oftener of the nose; absolute inactivity of the
bowels, and after a time a subsidence of the tumor and tenderness in
them; some suffusion of the eyes.Of these several signs of opiumism there is none more easily observed
and none more valuable than the frequency of the respiration; and while
the physician aims to reduce it to twelve in a minute, there are
chances that he will see it fall to something below that.I have often
counted it at seven, and in perhaps two cases it fell to seven in two
minutes; and yet these cases of marked oppression from opium all
recovered.In the cases in which the respiration has fallen so low
there has been considerable obtuseness of the mind; but in no case
except in the hospital patient already referred to have I seen
unconsciousness.Then the sleepiness, so long as the patient is easily
awakened, is wholly within the limits of safety.As to the quantity of opium to be given, I have known two grains every
two hours do the work, and in other cases many times this {1149}
quantity was necessary to produce this condition of semi-narcotism.The
plan is to begin with a dose that is safe--say two or three grains of
opium or its equivalent of sulphate of morphia--and in two hours notice
its effects.If any of the opium symptoms have appeared, repeat the
dose; if none, increase by one grain, and so on at intervals of two
hours till the degree of tolerance in the patient is ascertained.After
that the case can be treated by a diminished occupation of the
physician's time--two or three visits a day.The dose is to be
increased if the opium symptoms diminish before the disease yields, but
always to be diminished or discontinued if narcotism is approaching.The duration of the treatment will be sometimes no more than two or
three days; it may be a week, or even a fortnight, and in one case
already mentioned the symptoms persisted mildly for forty days, and
then yielded.In this case the medicine used was the sulphate of
morphia, and the enormous dose reached by steady and graduated increase
was one grain and a quarter every forty minutes in a boy ten years old.In some puerperal cases the doses have been so large as to require
witnesses to make the statement of them credible, and the
administration of them criminal had not the effect of each dose been
carefully studied and the amount of each measured by the action or
inadequate action of the next preceding one.Here are the doses given a woman who fell sick October 13, 1857; the
record was made by C. H. Rawson during the treatment, and was kindly
given me two or three years ago: On the first appearance of her
disease, while the diagnosis was uncertain, 10 grains of Dover's powder
gave her a quiet night.The next day the disease was more manifest, and
she took of Magendie's solution (2 grains of sulphate of morphine to a
drachm of water) x minims every hour; growing worse, at night she took
xxx minims every hour; the next day, xl minims every hour, and no
change of symptoms.She took in twenty-four hours 32 grains of sulphate
of morphia; slept, but was awakened by the slightest noise.On the
fourth day 3-1/3 drachms of the solution, and opium as follows: at 4
P.M., 3 gr.; at 5 P.M., 4 gr.; at 6 P.M., 5 gr.; at 7 P.M., 6 gr., and
6 gr.Fifth day, in twenty-six hours
took in opium and morphine the equivalent of 208 gr.of opium; on the seventh day, 221 gr.of opium; on
the eighth, 224 gr.; on the ninth, the same quantity; on the tenth, the
same; on the eleventh, 247 gr., pulse subsiding; on the twelfth, 261
gr., other symptoms better; on the thirteenth, 144 gr.hourly; slept for the first time heavily, all other symptoms
improving, bowels moved freely, ate well, tympanites subsiding;
fifteenth day, 1 gr.of opium every two hours, and at night the last
dose.The woman denied the opium habit, and the
medicines were tested by the apothecary.Such doses can only find their
justification in the demonstrated fact that smaller doses will not
produce the degree of narcotism desired.In Keating's edition of Ramsbotham's _Midwifery_ a case is reported by
myself in which a woman, by pretty rapidly increasing doses, reached
forty-eight grain doses of opium, with the effect of curing her disease
and substituting a temporary active delirium.A word of caution is probably necessary regarding the use of opium in
high doses when peritonitis and Bright's disease coexist.I have {1150}
already said that I have but scanty personal knowledge of such a
concurrence, but in Bright's disease alone I have known a large,
non-heroic dose of an opiate fatal.For example: A young man had a
felon on his finger, and did not sleep, so great was his pain.His
physician prescribed 40 drops of laudanum at bedtime.Not sleeping on
this, he took another portion of 40 drops, and in the morning he was
found in a comatose condition, and in the course of the day he died.A
post-mortem examination revealed Bright's disease, which was not before
suspected.A woman took half a grain of the sulphate of morphine--for
what reason I do not know.I was called to see her when she was in a
semi-comatose state.The time between my seeing her and that of taking
the morphine was fourteen or fifteen hours; its removal from the body
was therefore hopeless.Her limbs were swollen with oedema, and the
urine contained albumen and casts.Although the usual means of opposing
the poisonous effects of opium were resorted to, they were of little
use, and the patient died in the course of the day.These are selected
from a considerable number of similar cases that show a similarity in
their action on the brain of opium and urea.It seems that opium
precipitates the uraemic coma, yet the coma produced by these agents
combined is not so profound as that produced by opium alone.There is
in it some movement of the limbs or body or some imperfect utterances,
yet it seems to be more fatal than the coma of opium unaided.Notwithstanding all this, I have met with several cases of cardiac
disease combined with Bright's--perhaps I should say many--in which
half a grain of morphia sulphate has been taken every night to procure
sleep with only beneficial results.This has been observed several
times when physicians have been the patients.These facts are stated to show the hesitation and prudence that should
control the administration of opium when there is urea in the blood,
whether there is peritonitis or not; but a case in which one form of
Bright's disease preceded, and perhaps caused, peritonitis will be more
instructive: A gentleman sixty-eight years of age was attacked by
peritonitis on Thursday evening.There was a moderate chill at the
onset (this being one of the few cases in which I have witnessed this
occurrence).The diagnosis was then uncertain, and he took quieting
doses of Dover's powder, which gave him sleep.The next day the
diagnosis was easily made.The urine was examined for albumen, and none
found.He took only six-eighths of a grain of
sulphate of morphine in the first twenty hours.It was then increased,
so that in the next twenty-four hours he took two grains of the
sulphate in divided doses--a quantity which has been greatly exceeded
in hundreds of cases with the best results; but in this case coma was
the result.on Sunday he was comatose, but not profoundly;
he could be aroused.The breaths were five in the minute, the pulse
increasing in frequency; secretion of urine next to none.After seven hours, while the respiration was growing
more natural, the pulse grew more frequent and the stupor increased.the breathing was fifteen in the minute, and full and
perfectly easy, but the pulse was running at 140, and the coma
unbroken, and the pupils of good size.The effects of the opiate had
passed off, but those of uraemia were profound.After the alarming symptoms occurred we tried to procure another
specimen of the urine for fuller examination, but {1151} could not.It
was only after his death that we procured the evidences that he had
shown symptoms of contracted kidney for months.The urine contained no
albumen at the time of our examination, as very often happens in that
disease.Regarding other points in the opium treatment there is little to be
said.The bowels should be left
entirely at rest till they recover their muscular tone; then they will
expel first the gas, and then the feces; or if, after the inflammation
is subdued, they do not move of their own accord, injections are
admissible.I have often left the bowels absolutely inactive for
fourteen days without any recognizable consequences.If I meet a
physician who believes that leeches are essential, I yield him his
point, but never advise them.I do this because a moderate bloodletting
will do no harm, and little if any good.The same rule I apply to
irritating applications to the surface of the abdomen.Mercurials, I
think, are harmful, and therefore I object to them.As to food, it
should be milk, fresh eggs beaten up with water and pleasantly
flavored, peptones, etc.selected from among those that leave no
refuse.The testimony of physicians who have adopted this plan within my own
circle is unanimously in favor of it.B. R. Palmer of Woodstock, Vt.,
afterward of Louisville, Ky., who was the first to test it, told me
after a few years' trial that he used to dread peritonitis as he would
dread the plague, but with opium in his pocket he met it cheerfully and
hopefully, as he did a pneumonia.Chalmers of New York, who is known by
many readers of this article, has a very extensive practice, and he
told me lately that he had not had a fatal case of peritonitis in
twenty-two years.From whom did the profession
adopt it?In 1836-37, I visited daily the hospitals of London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, was in frequent intercourse with the physicians
of those cities, and never saw a patient anywhere treated by opium, and
never heard the least allusion to it.I can safely appeal to any
physician who was familiar with the history of the profession before
the year 1840, or for two or three years later perhaps, to inquire
whether anything was generally known regarding this treatment of
peritonitis, or whether he himself ever heard of it.Let the inquiry be
made of Willard Parker of New York or Alfred Stille of
Philadelphia--men of a degree of intelligence and learning that has
made them leaders in the profession--and of all the profession at that
time.I venture to assume that they were as ignorant as I was of what
Graves and Stokes had done.The following fact is significant: In 1843, Graves published _A System
of Clinical Medicine_, the preface of which is dated January, 1843.In
this he says he had previously published essays, lectures, and articles
in several medical journals.In this volume he intends, he says, "to
revise what I have written, and to compress the whole within the limits
of a single volume."There is nothing in the table of contents or
explanatory headings of the several chapters of this volume which
alludes to treating peritonitis by opium.It is fair to infer that the
cases treated in 1823 had made little impression on his mind, and that
he did not think his treatment could take rank as a discovery; and yet
Stokes had made favorable mention of it eleven years before this
publication.Graves, then, did not {1152} publish his cases, and the
first knowledge which the profession could have of them was through
Stokes's paper, published in the _Dublin Journal of Medical and
Chemical Science_, No.Perhaps the reason why Stokes's
paper produced so little impression on the profession may be found in
the fact that first numbers of journals of every sort have few readers.Anyway, it was not till after the opium treatment had attracted much
attention in this country that anybody here knew that Graves or Stokes
had ever had anything to do with it.Besides, Graves and Stokes had
only used opium in cases of perforation, and they had no plan or
symptomatic guide in the use of the drug.There is something new and strange in the following case copied from
the _Medical Record_ of May 12, 1883, under the heading, "Operative
Measures in Acute Peritonitis:" "Dr.Reibel relates the case of a
child, eight years old, suffering from acute idiopathic peritonitis.The disease had resisted all treatment, and the child being,
apparently, about to die, it was determined to open the abdomen with a
view to removing the fluid and washing out the peritoneal cavity with a
solution of carbolic acid.No fluid was
found in the abdominal cavity.In prolonging the incision a loop of the
intestine was punctured, as evidenced by the escape of gas and
intestinal fluid.The wound was washed with carbolic acid and covered
with a layer of antiseptic cotton.The following day the little patient
was nearly free from pain, and was able to retain a little milk.The
temperature had fallen from 104 degrees to 101 degrees, and the
tympanitis was almost entirely gone.The (wounded) loop of intestine
was adherent to the abdominal wall, and there had been no escape of
fluid into the peritoneal cavity.The patient made an excellent
recovery."If the statements of this abstract are true, and the future supports
the practice pursued in this case, acute peritonitis is likely to
become a surgical rather than a medical disease.Reibel thinks that
opening the intestine in the way he did is a better plan than the
punctures with the exploring-needle to relieve the patient of the
tympanitis.But it will require more facts than one to persuade the
profession that this mishap of the scalpel can grow into a rule of
practice.(The _Record_ finds this report in the _Journal de Medecine
de Paris_.)I cannot say that I see the value of a distinction made in 1877 by
Gubler between peritonitis and peritonism.By the latter term is meant
the total of nervous and other symptoms that arise in the course of
peritonitis.Trasour has lately revived this distinction, and thinks it
important, and that a light peritonitis may be attended by a grave
peritonism.He holds that the distinction is important, because "the
treatment of peritonism consists in the administration of alcohol,
chloral, and especially of opium in large doses.Of the latter fifteen
grains may be given in twenty-four hours.""The symptoms [of
peritonism] are produced through the agency of the great
sympathetic."[6]

[Footnote 6: _Med.I cannot say that I have seen great effects follow small causes, but
think that, in general, the effects of peritonitis on the pulse,
strength, nervous tone, etc.are, to some extent at least, a measure of
its severity.CONSEQUENCES OF PERITONITIS.--These are usually nothing.When recovery
takes place it is commonly complete, but cases have been known {1153}
in which the intestines have been left bound to the abdominal wall and
to each other, and so made incapable of their natural action.The
results of this are a swollen, tympanitic abdomen and impaction of the
bowels, but the general health may be very good.A woman at Bellevue
was left in this condition, yet she performed the duties of nurse in
one of the wards for some years, and finally disappeared from the
institution, and I do not know how it ended with her--probably by the
breaking up of the adhesions and a return of the bowels to their
natural condition.In some few cases there remains new tissue, which in time is partly
broken up and remains partly attached.In this manner strings and bands
of considerable strength can be formed, and into these loops the
intestine may pass, so as to form an internal hernia of a very
dangerous character.In some bands are formed across the intestine,
which by contraction flatten the tube and obstruct the fecal movement.There is reason to believe that such bands and bridles are formed by
local inflammation of such imperfect manifestation by symptoms that the
patient knows nothing about it.A very striking case illustrating the
possible sequence of this inflammation came under my observation early
in my professional life: A <DW52> woman about twenty-five years of age
gave a very clear history of a peritonitis from the consequences of
which she had suffered two years before I saw her.About six months
after recovery she began to have constipation and to suffer from small
and frequent discharges of urine.The latter gradually grew milky and
to have a bad odor; the constipation grew more and more, and at length
came to be absolute for many days; then would come a diarrhoea of some
hours' continuance, after which she would have a feeling of relief.She was emaciated, and so feeble as
hardly able to leave her bed.She vomited occasionally, and her
appetite for food was all gone.The urine was heavily loaded with pus,
and was ammoniacal.At post-mortem
examination a firm membrane was found strained across the upper strait
of the pelvis, wholly separating the abdominal cavity from the pelvic.The left posterior border was drawn very
tensely over the colon where it passed into the pelvic cavity,
flattening it down completely and making stricture.To the under or
lower surface the fundus of the uterus and the base of the bladder were
firmly adherent, and in this way both were suspended.The effect of
this unnatural suspension of the inactive uterus did not seem to be
noticeable, but with the bladder it was very different: it contained
three to four ounces of water, ammoniacal and full of pus, and it could
never have emptied itself.During the
peritonitis a false membrane was effused on the pelvic viscera in situ.When the period of contraction which is common to all such structures
came, the new membrane was separated from the greater part of these two
organs, but not from their bases.The firm attachment to the brim of
the pelvis did the rest.So unusual a sequel of peritonitis I think
deserves a record.I should add there were no adhesions above the
pelvis.Such a structure as this, found long after the active symptoms
of peritonitis have passed, as also the bands and cords before spoken
of, does not give support to the doctrine that the false membranes are
broken down into fatty matter, and in this condition absorbed.{1154} The possible remote effects of peritonitis are shown in a case
reported by E. A. Mearns to the _Medical Record_, published Sept.15,
1883: A young man, aged nineteen, four years after he had had acute
general peritonitis was attacked with constipation, which was absolute.He had had before occasional attacks of pain in the bowels and
constipation, which were overcome.He had the
train of symptoms usual in intestinal obstruction.There was no fever
or tympanitis, and this time but little pain.There was a tangle and a constriction of the intestines at the middle
of the ileum, caused by the contraction and hardening of the effusion
of the old peritonitis, and the intestine was very much softened.H. B. Sands reports in another number of the same journal: "The patient
was a man about thirty who had suffered from acute obstruction for a
week.When the abdomen was opened the
intestinal coils were found extremely adherent one to another in
consequence of a former peritonitis.A careful search failed to
discover the nature or seat of the obstruction.The abdominal wound was
closed, and the patient died soon after."There is no part of the gastro-intestinal canal that may not, from one
cause or another, become the seat of ulceration.The jejunum is the
part of the tube long supposed to be an exception to this rule, but
even in it one or two observers have found ulcers.These ulcers often
exist without distinctive symptoms, and may go on to cicatrization
without announcing themselves.In the stomach, however, there are
commonly indications which will admit a conjecture of their existence,
and perhaps a diagnosis.Sometimes these ulcers penetrate all the
tissues of the tube and allow the contents of the intestine to escape
into the peritoneal cavity, or they may have destroyed all but the
external layer, and some succussion, as in coughing, sneezing,
laughing, or perhaps straining at stool, may make the opening complete,
with the same results.In these cases it seems to be inevitable that
inflammation should follow, unless it has preceded, the complete
opening and sealed it up by adhesions.The tendency of such an
inflammation is to be local and limited, but when the contents of
intestines escape into the peritoneal cavity it usually becomes
general.These accidents are usually attended by the sudden development
of local pain, by rapid increase in the frequency of the pulse,
paleness, and prostration.The perforation of the vermiform appendix is
often a partial exception to this statement, for, while the local
symptoms are marked, the sympathy of the general system is not so
quickly awakened.The same can be said of perityphlitis.The symptoms
are often local for some time--a day or more; sometimes subside, as if
the disease were cured, and then return in full form.This is produced
by the tendency of the inflammation to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of its cause.Lymph is effused at a short distance from
the point of irritation, and seals the parts together, so as to shut in
the offending substance; and though this substance may produce pus in
contact with intestine or appendix, that {1155} fluid is held for a
time, as in abscess.It may be permanently held in its new-made sac
till it burrows into some near part, as the intestine or bladder, or
remain an abscess till opened by Willard Parker's puncture.On the
other hand, the contents of this sac may be increased till it breaks
bounds and causes extension of the peritoneal inflammation or general
peritonitis.In one particular case this process of setting limits and
breaking through them occurred in a young lady four times at intervals
of from one to two days.When the limiting adhesions were established
symptoms would subside, so as to encourage in her physicians the hope,
even the expectation, of recovery; but again and again the fire was
rekindled, and she died eight days after the first attack.In the
greater number of cases the first breaking of the adhesions is followed
by full peritonitis, and this often by death.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have not been
attended by the severe pain described by most authors, but by a sudden
prostration of strength and a feeling of disquiet and sinking at the
stomach; more of collapse than of inflammation in the symptoms; no
tumefaction of the bowels; almost nothing to indicate the nature of the
accident, but a sudden new sensation in the bowels, a rapid increase in
the frequency of the pulse, it growing small as it increases in
rapidity, and a pale and shrunken countenance, and death in from twelve
to thirty hours.Then, on inspection, hardly any signs of peritonitis
are found.The peritoneal vessels are fuller and the membrane redder
than in health, and its surface covered with the thinnest possible film
of lymphy exudation, and some serum in the deeper parts of the cavity.These ulcerations of the stomach are not always fatal by peritonitis.A
few instances are recorded in which adhesions of the outer surface of
the organ to adjoining organs have taken place, so as to protect the
peritoneum almost wholly from the fatal contact with the gastric
fluids, and death has occurred in some other way.I have a remarkable
specimen illustrating this fact.It was taken from the body of a woman
of about middle age who had long had symptoms of dyspepsia, and had
from time to time vomited a little blood.It was not difficult to
recognize ulcer, but the extent and peculiarities of it could be
learned only by inspection.She died suddenly of copious haematemesis.On examination an ulcer two and a half to three inches in its several
diameters was found, beginning near the pylorus and extending toward
the left, which in this large space had destroyed all the coats of the
stomach and exposed an inch and more of the right extremity of the
pancreas and about the same extent of the liver.The liver and pancreas
were both perceptibly eroded when exposed, and in the latter an artery
that would admit the head of a large pin was opened.The stomach,
outside of this extraordinary ulcer, was strongly attached to the
adjacent organs.The ulcerations of typhoid fever penetrate the intestine about three
times in a hundred cases of the fever.This result is reached by the
study of a large number of cases, and appears to be pretty generally
admitted.The point where this perforation occurs is in the ileum, near
the ileo-caecal valve--within a foot or eighteen inches of it in the
great majority of cases, although it has been known to occur
seventy-two inches above the valve, and it has been seen very rarely in
the caecum.The fever itself may be either severe or mild.Suddenly
severe pain {1156} sets in, oftenest in the lower part of the abdomen,
and spreads rapidly; the pulse is quickly accelerated and becomes
small; and it has been lately stated that in this and other intestinal
perforations the gases of the bowels, escaping into the peritoneal
cavity, will give resonance to percussion over the lower part of the
liver.Fetid gas found in this cavity after death is not without
importance; for example, a distinguished Senator at Washington died not
long ago of a very painful abdominal disease which his physicians
declined to relieve with opium, though the patient pleaded for it.Although the distance he had to
travel was many hundred miles, he found the patient alive and still
suffering.He at once gave morphine for the relief of the pain, but the
patient died.Now, this gentleman had diabetes a year or more before
his death, recognized by his physician at home and also by myself.While under my observation the urine ceased to contain sugar and its
quantity became normal, but soon after this albumen was occasionally
found in it.The quantity was generally small, and casts were only
found now and then.This new disease was mild, and seemed to be, within
certain limits, manageable.He went to Washington under injunction that
he was not to let official and professional labors bear with any weight
upon him.This last sickness and the death would naturally enough be
supposed to be some new phase or consequence of the previous illness.But, while a post-mortem examination was not permitted, the family
wished to have the body embalmed.The family physician accompanied the
embalmer, and as the latter made a cut through the abdominal walls
there was a gush of air laden with fecal odor, and he through this
opening saw the intestines covered with false membrane.He satisfied
himself that the intestine was not opened.This fetid gas came from the
peritoneal cavity.An ulcer had perforated the intestine somewhere, and
caused the death.The final disease could be only remotely dependent on
the patient's previous illness, if at all.His impaired health may have
made the ulcer possible.All kinds of perforations in the bowels, except those of the stomach,
caecum, and appendix, even the cancerous, have one history and the same
symptoms; and if treatment is ever successful in such occurrences it
must all be based on one set of rules--absolute rest, no pressure on
the bowels, and no movements of the muscles that will aggravate it;
food that will be wholly digested and absorbed by the stomach; complete
abstinence from cathartic and laxative medicines, and the free
administration of opium or morphine.By these means, I fully believe,
numbers have already been saved from the fatal consequences of
peritonitis caused by perityphlitis and perforation of the vermiform
appendix--some under my own observation and others under that of my
friends.A boy fourteen years of age was brought to bed by a pain in
the right iliac fossa.After a few hours his father, a physician,
desired me to see him.There was already a perceptible fulness, with
dulness on percussion, in the fossa, and some febrile excitement.I
gave a portion of morphine, and promised to call the next morning.In
the morning a message came from the father stating that the boy was
better and there was no need of further attendance.The pain had returned, and had spread over most of the
bowels.He took tincture of opium, of which
I believe the largest dose was 100 {1157} drops, reached after three or
four days of gradual but steady increase of dose.From that point the
patient got better, and the quantity of the medicine was
correspondingly reduced.There were a relapse and a repetition of the
treatment, and again the disease yielded.During convalescence, about
fourteen days from the attack, the boy, after emptying his bladder, was
suddenly pressed to continue the discharge.Now he voided what appeared
to be blood, two or three tablespoonfuls.It was, however, pus with
blood enough to color it.This purulent discharge from the bladder
continued for about three weeks, the boy steadily recovering his
health.This occurred twenty or more years ago, and that boy is now a
well-known physician.In 1850, or thereabout, I attended a physician through an attack of
typhoid fever.In the third week there was a sudden outbreak of
peritonitis.The opium treatment was resorted to, and he recovered, and
had good health for twenty years after.Peritonitis occurs rarely in
typhoid fever from any other cause than perforation, and its occurrence
in this case at this time, when perforation is more likely to occur,
renders it probable, at least, that this attack was produced by that
cause.March 3, 1883, autopsy of Wm.Fletcher, age 59, iron-worker.23d, he was attacked with pain in the region of the right
iliac fossa; it was severe.There was no chill, but little fever, and
only slight acceleration of the pulse.His stomach was a good deal
disturbed, and the bowels were soon distended with flatus.I saw him on
the Tuesday following, with James D. Elliott.The bowels were a good
deal swollen and very resonant on percussion; pulse 84.His stomach was
still greatly disturbed, so that he retained no food, yet there was no
green vomit, but much flatulency.The movements in respiration were
particularly noticeable, being nearly or quite as much abdominal as in
health.There was a short friction sound in inspiration, but an entire
absence of the sound produced by peristaltic action.There was no
dulness on percussing over the iliac fossa, and no pain on pressure
over any part of the abdomen.I was careful in examining the right
fossa, for the first pain was there, and it was severe; but there was
no physical sign by which the perforation could be ascertained.Still,
my mind dwelt on the probability of perforation, and I expressed my
fears to Elliott regarding it.The bowels had not moved for two or three days.The next day Flint was added to the consultation.The symptoms had
changed but little; the pulse was 102; no pain, no tenderness, no
peristaltic action; slight friction at one point only; the abdominal
respiration was as marked as before.Frequency of respiration, 18;
patient sleepy; pupils only slightly contracted.When we were in
consultation I again expressed my fear of perforation, but Flint
expressed the most decided opinion as to its absence, because there was
dulness to percussion over the liver.I had read his paper on the
intrusion of gas between the ribs and liver in cases of intestinal
perforation, and felt as if I were almost reproved for entertaining the
thought without this physical corroboration.Thursday, March 1st, the stomach had become much more retentive; there
were no pain and no tenderness on pressure; pulse 109; no friction
sound, no sound of peristaltic action, no dulness on percussion over
right iliac fossa, but resonance over the whole abdomen, excepting over
the {1158} pubes; there the resonance was not clear; over a small space
there was dulness; this was ascribed to moderate fulness of the
bladder, and, as there had been no difficulty in emptying it, nothing
was said of it.The abdominal respiratory movements were the same as
before.Friday morning, at 3 A.M., no marked change had occurred in the
symptoms, but from this time onward there was a steady sinking of the
vital powers.The pulse grew small and frequent, the hands became cool,
the breathing more frequent, and without any sudden change or new
symptom he died early in the morning.At the last visit there was no
resonance on percussion over the liver.Autopsy, Saturday, March 3d, 2 P.M.The bowels were distended, as they
mostly are in peritonitis, but not extraordinarily.There was now
pretty free resonance over the liver.The section to open the abdominal
cavity was carefully made, with the aim of ascertaining whether there
was air or gas in the peritoneal cavity.When a half-inch opening was
made through the peritoneum, gas was forced out through it for some
seconds with an unmistakable noise.The bowels were not opened by this
cut.The bowels exposed, a very thin film of false membrane was found
on all the middle and upper portions of the intestines, with a fringe
of injection where the folds came in contact.But two or three inches
above the symphysis pubis the section opened a collection of pus which
extended downward into the pelvis.Somewhere hereabout--neither of us
could say exactly where--was found a lump of fecal matter, not
indurated, as large as a marrowfat pea, the intestine still unopened.Search was made for the vermiform appendix.At first it was not
recognized on account of its remarkable shortness.It was found,
however, pointing directly toward the median line of the body, and was
short because a part had been separated from the rest by slough.The
end of what remained was marked by a border, one-eighth of an inch
deep, of a very dark-green gangrenous color.We did not attempt to
measure the quantity of pus.It was
completely bounded and shut in by adhesions.At no time during life was there resonance over the liver, but there
was some at the time of post-mortem examination before the bowels were
opened, due perhaps to the fact that at death the relaxation of the
muscles allowed the gas to rise higher than it did during life.The
unusual median position of the abscess is important in accounting for
absence of dulness, when it is usually found in slough or ulcer of the
vermiform appendix."A Fatal Case of Typhlitis without Recognizable Symptoms."Under this
title Jose M. Fisser published a case of inflammation of the vermiform
appendix causing general peritonitis in a young woman nineteen years of
age.The peculiarities of the case were that the appendix was not
perforated, and consequently there was no tumor in the right iliac
fossa--that the symptoms were all referred to the epigastrium, without
even tenderness in the fossa.She walked the floor and tossed about in
bed; the highest temperature was 103 degrees, and the most frequent
pulse was 120, and these continued but a short time.Of tympanitis
there was none till near death, and then but little.The obscurity in
diagnosis led to the publication of the case.The cause of this disease
was fecal matter, not very hard, in the appendix.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Med.{1159} As much has been said in this article on the diagnosis of
peritonitis, it may be well to introduce a case where that diagnosis
was conjectural, and yet quite another state existed.H----, when her disease was advanced, twice.My impression was that she
had peritonitis, but this opinion was held with grave doubt.After her
death, Smith sent me the following record of the autopsy: "Mrs.H----
died Friday evening at ten o'clock; next day, at three in the
afternoon, we made an autopsy.No gas or fluid in the peritoneal
cavity; the small intestines inflated almost to bursting, with
injection of the capillaries.In the left iliac region we at once
discovered a portion of the intestine almost black, and on examination
found a firm white band encircling and constricting that portion.Upon
liberating the gas the intestines collapsed, and the constricted
portion was released and easily removed.A further examination showed
that two of the epiploic appendages, coming off from the colon above
the sigmoid flexure, had united at their extreme points and formed a
loop two and a half to three inches long, and through this loop or ring
a portion of the ileum had passed, and was there constricted.The
constricted intestine was about four feet in length.This examination
has been gratifying to me.There was a small quantity of bloody serum
in the peritoneal cavity low down in the pelvis.The dark grumous blood
that passed the bowels on the second and third days can now be
accounted for, and corroborates your remark that the hemorrhage looked
like strangulation.This must be a new
cause of strangulation, and one that we could not anticipate."There was, before I saw her, a single vomit of a suspicious fluid, but
the evidence was not strong enough to enable us to pronounce it
stercoraceous.Some of the observers noticed bloody serum in the
peritoneal cavity, and perhaps some shreds of lymph, but that was in
consequence of the strangulation.This may occur anywhere in the broad extent of the peritoneum, and will
be more or less limited in different cases, or may be limited for a
time, and then become general.The
product of the diseased action may be serum or lymph or pus, or all of
them.The cause of this local inflammation is sometimes very obvious,
in other cases wholly unknown.The consequences vary all the way from
harmlessness to death; the symptoms are as variable as the
consequences, making the diagnosis easy in some cases, in others
impossible.Some cases in which it was not difficult to recognize it
have already been recorded--those caused by perityphlitis and
perforation of the vermiform appendix, for example.In such cases the
local pain, the swelling, the dulness or resonance on percussion,
depending on whether the tumor is made by inflammatory exudation or
gas, together with the general symptoms and the history, leave but
little ground for doubt regarding the character of the disease.Perhaps
one-half the local abscesses which form between the folds of the
peritoneum are recognizable during life by the local, associated with
the general, symptoms.When situated in the posterior and upper part of
the abdominal cavity, the hand gives little, {1160} perhaps no,
assistance, as in the most widely-known case of abscess that has been
recorded in all time.While the physicians were giving to the country
hopeful reports day by day, thousands of medical men shook their heads
and spoke sadly of the prospects.The illustrious patient was losing
rather than gaining strength and flesh, his appetite poor, his
digestion poor--a strong man growing helpless--and, above all, a pulse
that for months never fell below 100.With an adequate cause of
abscess, whether there were chills or not, what else could it be?Thus,
in peritoneal abscesses that cannot be felt the general symptoms are of
great importance to the diagnosis.When abscesses tend to discharge
their contents soon or late--sometimes into the intestine, sometimes
into the bladder, sometimes externally: in such cases there is a fair
chance.Sometimes they burst into the peritoneum: such cases are almost
inevitably fatal; even opium will not cure them.The pus of these
abscesses often has the fecal odor, which it acquires by the
transmission of the intestinal gases through the intestinal walls.I
was attending, with the late James R. Wood, a young lady in whom
peritoneal abscess had been recognized.It was anterior to the
intestines.In the consultation, while we were discussing the propriety
of using the trocar, the mother became alarmed at the odor and
appearance of the urine just passed, and summoned the doctors back to
the chamber.The urine
contained pus which gave off the fecal odor strongly.It should be added that these abscesses, as well as those of
the convex surface of the liver and those that are post-peritoneal,
sometimes pierce the diaphragm and produce empyema, or by previous
adhesion of the lung to its upper surface find a way into a bronchial
tube, and so the pus is expectorated.The history of local fibrinous exudations is not as easily told as that
of the purulent.We find from time to time, on the peritoneum, bands,
patches, or cords of false membrane, which were produced in so quiet a
way that we can get no information regarding the time when they were
formed, and perhaps the subject of them was not aware that anything was
wrong with the bowels till he began to have the symptoms of
obstruction.The omentum is found thickened and contracted.The mesentery and
mesocolon are seen in a similar condition, causing wrinkling and
shortening of the bowels.The spleen has on its surface patches or even
plates, or one great plate, of firm fibrinous deposit, often
cartilaginous in density, sometimes calcareous; and we can rarely fix
the time of these occurrences by any symptoms.It is not always so with
the liver.We are acquainted with a perihepatitis which is acute,
attended by pain in the right side, a febrile movement, and, if the
inflammation reaches the under surface of the organ, by jaundice, and
have learned to combat this with cups and opiates, the latter in rather
free but not heroic doses, and to expect recovery in a few days.This
may leave the liver wholly or partly invested with a layer of false
membrane which may have a sequel of importance.Then, again, we find
the organ invested with a thick contractile membrane, but cannot learn
that the symptoms of perihepatitis have ever occurred.The diseased
action which produced this bad investment appears to be analogous to
that which not only covers the organ with a thinner coat of similar new
tissue, but inlays it everywhere with the same material in cirrhosis.This also is {1161} unattended by local pain.The effects that may
result from this encasing of the liver in a strong contractile capsule
may be illustrated by the following case (the late Buck was the
physician): The patient was an unmarried lady of middle age who had
consecrated her life to charitable works.In searching for the
suffering poor she often had to ascend several flights of stairs.The
time came when she found this fatiguing and a tax on her respiration.She observed at the same time that the bowels were enlarged.She called
Buck, and he had no difficulty in discovering ascitic fluid.He was
surprised, as he knew that her habits were perfectly good, and she had
very little the appearance of an invalid.Notwithstanding the proper
use of the usual remedies for dropsy, the fluid slowly increased, and
at length he was obliged to draw it off.He found it to be a clear,
yellowish serum.In the course of about two years she was tapped four
times.I saw her, with Buck, after these tappings, when the fluid had
again been effused in quantity that half filled the peritoneal cavity.The emaciation was not considerable; there was nothing of the
semi-bronzed color of the skin so common in cirrhosis of similar
duration; her appetite and digestion were not materially impaired; the
temperature was natural; the pulse was increased in frequency only a
few beats.The skin over the abdomen was in a soft, natural state, and
there was nothing that suggested a hyperaemic or inflammatory dropsy.The liver on percussion appeared to be reduced in size.Taking all
things into account, and especially the patient's habits and the
absence cancerous cachexia, it seemed probable that the dropsy arose
from atrophy of the liver, and that the atrophy was caused by an
adventitious capsule of the organ, although the patient had never had
symptoms of perihepatitis.From this point the fluid did not increase
or diminish, but remained stationary till she died, perhaps two years
after, of some other disease.Meanwhile, the lady resumed her favorite
charity-work to a limited extent.At the post-mortem examination the
capsule was found investing nearly the whole liver, but not materially
obstructing the gall-duct.The new membrane was thick and strong,
having a thickness of at least one-twentieth of an inch.The remaining
liver structure was of natural appearance.The organ was reduced to
one-half its natural size.I have doubted whether any disease deserving this name really exists
independent of such low inflammatory action as may arise from the
irritations of tumors or heterologous deposits.This statement refers
to general not local peritonitis.I have never seen anything that would
lead me to believe that acute diffuse peritonitis can be deprived of
its acute character and still continue an inflammation.With me it has
always been death or cure.I have already referred to a case in which
after recovery the bowels were greatly disturbed by tympanitis for
years.But this came from adhesions: her general health was good.I
have at long intervals met with cases of ascites in which the
peritoneal membrane was redder than natural, and in which no
obstruction to the portal {1162} circulation was discovered.This,
however, I have regarded as hyperaemia rather than inflammation.Bauer,[8] however, gives to these cases the title latent general
peritonitis, especially when after death an abnormal adhesion is found
here and there.In the cases that I have seen there was a peculiar
state of the surface of the abdomen.The skin there was more or less
scaly and dry, but I do not remember whether there were internal
adhesions.Bauer regards the diagnosis of this form of disease as
difficult, but refers to the constantly present meteorism as well as
serous fluid.I have met with three or four instances in which at the
time of puberty an abdominal dropsy has rather suddenly occurred,
lasting one to three months, and disappearing on the use of diuretics.I have had no reason to attribute this effusion to inflammatory action,
except in one case.A lady of extraordinary symmetry and beauty of
form, in excellent health, whom I had treated for this disorder twelve
years before, applied to know whether there was anything in that
disease that would prevent her having children.She had been married
seven or eight years, and had not been pregnant.The question then
occurred to me, At the time of the dropsy could there have been lymphy
exudation that has since confined the ovaries in an unnatural position?The treatment which Bauer prefers for
his latent peritonitis consists in "painting with iodine, the use of
diuretics, and the regulation of diaphoresis by means of Turkish
baths."[Footnote 8: _Cyclopaedia of the Practice, etc._, vol.Another form of general chronic peritonitis is, according to Bauer,
that which follows acute peritonitis.He quotes several authorities in
support of his views.I must draw on him for a description of it, for,
as I have said, practically I know nothing about it.The symptoms of acute peritonitis are all toned down, but do not all
disappear.Vomiting occurs occasionally; tenderness is diminished, but
is quite perceptible; meteorism diminishes, but fluctuates greatly;
appetite is poor or variable; constipation alternates with diarrhoea or
is followed by dysentery; now there is a febrile heat, and then the
temperature is normal--this fever is most likely to come in the
evening; the pulse is frequent and varying; ultimately extreme
emaciation and anaemia.The most striking feature of this condition
appears to be sacculation of the fluid in the abdomen, wholly or
partially; this fluid then is not freely movable, but will give dulness
on percussion, which may contrast well with intestinal resonance in its
immediate neighborhood.When the tension of the abdominal wall is
diminished these sacs can be felt by the hand as uneven tumors.Colicky
pains occur, and in a case cited it was at one time very severe, at
another only slight.The majority of the cases terminate, after a
protracted course, fatally.Recovery may occur by absorption or
external evacuation of the fluid.Bauer makes still another class of cases of chronic peritonitis--those
arising in the course of old ascites; he, however, does not make much
out of it.He thinks the cases of this kind occur with cardiac and
hepatic disease, and particularly with the nutmeg liver.The symptoms,
he admits, are neither well defined nor severe, and the anatomical
changes consist "in thickening of the serous membrane by a slight
deposit of fibrin, {1163} slight turbidity of the ascitic fluid, and a
few flakes of fibrin suspended in it."He then, strangely, gives, as if
they were illustrations of such a disease, two cases in which death by
acute peritonitis followed the last of many tappings, in one of which a
pool of pus was found encysted in front of the intestines.Probably most practitioners who are in the habit of making post-mortem
examinations have seen the flakes of lymph in the ascitic fluid, etc.,
but the German physicians have been the first, I believe, to regard
such cases as belonging to separate forms of disease.William Pepper has published[9] a case observed by himself and G. A.
Rex which shows non-malignant chronic peritonitis better than any I can
recall to mind.The report forms the sequel to the case of the young
woman on whom he successfully performed paracentesis of the
pericardium.This young woman began to have double pleuritic effusion, and this was
soon followed by ascites three and a half months after the operation.From that time the ascites was better or worse, but did not wholly
leave her, and became considerable before her death.This was sudden,
she having some convulsive movements in extremis.Lesions were found in
the thoracic cavity like those discovered in the abdominal, showing, it
was believed, a special tendency in this person to plastic exudation on
the serous membranes."The lower part of the abdomen was found occupied
by an extensive effusion.There
were few if any signs of inflammation of the intestinal peritoneum, but
marked changes were observed in the parietal peritoneum and in the
capsules of the liver and spleen.The peritonitis was most marked in
the upper segment of the abdomen, while the parietal membrane presented
large patches of irregular thickening.No tubercles were found on any
part of the peritoneum.The capsules of the liver and spleen were
greatly thickened, whitish, opaque, and densely fibrous.The liver was
enlarged and heavy, and so tightly bound by its thickened capsule that
its shape was somewhat altered."The diaphragm, especially that part of it underlying the pericardial
sacs, had undergone marked fibroid degeneration.The muscular tissue
was much atrophied; many fasciculi had evidently disappeared, while
many others were markedly narrowed, some of them shading off to a width
of less than 1/3000 of an inch, and finally disappearing altogether.They retained, however, even in their narrowest dimensions, their
transverse striae."(It may be remarked, in passing, that this substitution of fibrous for
muscular tissue follows the same law that it does in the heart when
that organ is the seat of fibrosis or fibrous degeneration.Here it was
supposed to be the consequence of a low grade of inflammatory action.In the abdomen these observers found nothing which suggested the
possibility of tubercles or any obscure form of cancer.In the
pericardium, on the heart side, were found numerous small nodular
roughnesses.Irregularities of the pericardial false membrane are so
common that nothing but the close and universal adhesions would raise
any question of these relations.But tubercles would hardly be here and
nowhere else.{1164} Delafield says that one form of the chronic disease is the
continuance of his cellular peritonitis.In this, he says, the surface
of the omentum is covered with cells which look as if they were derived
from the endothelium and connective-tissue cells, although they differ
from the normal shape of these.The new cells are for the most part
polygonal, of different size, with one or several nuclei, and
giant-cells--large granular masses filled with nuclei.Although these
new cells are produced over the entire surface of the peritoneum, yet,
as a rule, they are more numerous in little patches here and there.These little patches may be heaped together in such numbers as to form
nodules visible to the naked eye.There is never any stroma between
these cells.This form of peritonitis occurs most frequently with organic heart
disease, with cirrhosis of the liver, with chronic pulmonary phthisis,
and with acute general tuberculosis.In the two latter diseases he
thinks they have been improperly called tubercles.He describes a form of chronic adhesion of peritoneal surfaces that
occurs without the intervention of fibrin, but, as he supposes, by
coalescence of the branching cells and a production from them of a
fibrillated basement substance, the fibrils crossing in all directions.In the midst of these fibrils he finds the nuclei of these cells.He
finds also in the immediate neighborhood of these adhesions thousands
of branching cells that are attached one to another and float free in
the water, the fixed end being attached to the peritoneum.He regards
such a peritonitis with adhesions as a more advanced stage of the forms
of cellular peritonitis already described, and the new cells are
changed into membrane.Sayre has published an extraordinary case in the _Transactions of the
Pathological Society_.He calls it chronic proliferative peritonitis;
it might be called more aptly the consequence of peritonitis.A large, strong man fell from a hammock, the rope breaking, upon his
shoulders, and felt a severe pain in his stomach, and soon developed
symptoms of peritonitis.About one month after he was tapped, and
240 ounces of serum were drawn.He was tapped one hundred and
eighty-seven times, and 1203-5/16 pounds of fluid were taken from him
during the remainder of his life.The liver and spleen were covered by a
thick layer of false membrane, intestines were glued together in the
upper part of the abdomen, and the stomach was adherent to the lower
surface of the liver.The portal vein was contracted by this membranous
coating.There were numerous other lesions in the heart and pleura, but
these will account for the dropsy.This man was unusually strong and hearty until 1876, when he had an
attack of double pleuro-pneumonia, and in 1878 he slipped on the front
steps and fell, but seemed to recover from the effects of this.The
fall from the swing occurred in July, 1879.[10]

[Footnote 10: _Med.{1165} Tubercular Peritonitis.This form of disease is by no means uniform in its first symptoms or in
its progress.The only things uniformly attending it are tubercles on
the peritoneum and more or less of inflammatory effusion, chiefly lymph
and serum; tumor and hardness of the bowels, general or local; deranged
function of the stomach and intestines; emaciation; and extreme
fatality.In some cases the invasion is acute and marked--a chill followed by
fever, vomiting, early development of meteorism, and in a few days a
point or points of resistance to pressure, but not necessarily dulness
on percussion.In a few days the febrile action and the meteorism may
subside, leaving the symptoms of local peritonitis.But we have not
long to wait for a renewal of them and an evident extension of the
inflammatory action.Remission and relapse alternate at varying
intervals, until the whole extent of the peritoneal surface seems to be
involved in inflammation.With this mode of development meteorism may
not be renewed in the most common way.The lymphy product of
inflammation may so bind the intestines to the posterior walls of the
abdomen that they cannot extend forward, but are pushed upward against
the liver and diaphragm, and so encroach on the thoracic space.But
then the anterior parietes are tense and hard, and do not move in
respiration.The febrile heat may not continue more than two or three
months, but the pulse will be frequent to the end.There will be a
thinning of bowel walls, and here and there a knuckle of adherent
intestines may cause some prominence and give some resonance on
percussion.There will be also occasional vomiting, and the dejections
will be irregular--maybe only deficient or thin; there may be an
alternation of constipation and diarrhoea.Tuberculous ulcerations of the mucous layer of the bowels is not
uncommon in tubercular peritonitis, and these ulcers have in rare cases
perforated and allowed the fecal matter to accumulate in considerable
quantity in a sac limited by previous adhesions.In all forms of
tubercular peritonitis death is caused as often by grave complications
as by what appears to be the primary disease.The affection occurs in
probably every instance in those who had at the beginning, or had
acquired in its progress, what we call the tubercular diathesis.We are
not surprised, therefore, to find on inspection a wide diffusion of
tubercles in the body, particularly on other serous membranes, and in
the lungs.Death may occur, then, from phthisis pulmonalis or from
pleurisy or meningitis, as well as from the exhaustion and accidents of
the peritoneal disease.The effusion serum or turbid serum is very
common in tubercular peritonitis, and can be recognized by the dulness
it produces in part of the cavity, and sometimes by fluctuation.It is
often sacculated, but it is not constantly found after death, it having
been absorbed before, and perhaps long before, that event.In other cases the invasion of the disease is stealthy and deceiving.It comes so quietly that the patient is not conscious of any local
disorder beyond a dyspepsia and irregular action of the bowels.He has
a pulse of growing frequency, but if he knows it he ascribes it to his
dyspepsia.He is slowly losing flesh and strength; this he accounts for
in the same way.At length a perceptible swelling of the bowels
attracts his attention.At this stage the physician finds that the
swollen bowels are tympanitic everywhere or only in the upper, while
there is evidence of fluid {1166} effusion in the more depending,
parts.He discovers some, it may be little, tenderness on pressure, and
a pulse of 85, or maybe 90, increasing in frequency toward evening.The
appetite is poor, the digestion slow, and occasionally there is
vomiting; the complexion is pale and a little dingy; the skin of the
abdomen may be dry and rough or may be natural; some colicky pains have
been or soon will be felt.From this point the disease gradually
advances.The distension of the bowels slowly increases or they are
firmly retracted; the emaciation increases; the strength diminishes;
there is often cough, which is generally dry; the bowels are slow or
diarrhoea alternates with constipation; with the distended bowels there
is always more than natural resonance on percussion, except when there
is fluid effusion, though not often the full tympanitic sound observed
in acute diffuse peritonitis.This resonance is not equal, always, in
different parts of the abdomen; the respiration is embarrassed and
almost wholly thoracic.The abdomen is often as large as that of a
female at full term of pregnancy, and indeed the condition has been
mistaken for pregnancy.This is an inexcusable blunder in a case like
that which I have in mind--a young unmarried woman.She had no dulness
on percussion in the space that would be occupied by the gravid uterus,
but rather resonance.The case might have been a little less clear if
there had been fluid effusion in the abdominal cavity, but if this were
not encysted it would flow from one side of the abdomen to the other
when the patient turned correspondingly in bed; if it was encysted,
there would be small chances that it would have the shape and position
of the gravid uterus; if it had, there would be no chance of hearing in
it the foetal heart or feeling the foetal movements; and after all this
there remains the experimentum crucis--a vaginal examination.Some aid is found,
possibly, in the medical history of the family, in tuberculous
antecedents, yet I remember cases in which no phthisis could be found
in any living or dead member of the family on the paternal or maternal
side as far back as it could be traced.Some aid is found if the
patient himself has any of the physical or rational indications of
pulmonary phthisis, and yet there are recorded cases in which the
abdominal symptoms were the first to appear.The prominent German
physicians attach great importance to the pre-existence of a cheesy
mass or degeneration somewhere in the body as the real parent of
tubercles wherever they appear.The truth of this doctrine, I do not
think, has received anything like universal recognition; and if it had,
as this cheesy degeneration is often, perhaps commonly, only
discoverable after death, it could rarely give any assistance in
diagnosis, so that the early diagnosis is always difficult, and a very
early one often impossible.But as time goes on, and the symptoms are
better defined and show themselves one after another as they are above
described, it seems as if a careful observer could not confound it with
anything except perhaps one of the other forms of chronic peritonitis
or cancerous peritonitis.As to the latter, the cough which exists in
most cases of tubercular peritonitis will assist in the distinction,
but a physical examination much more; for a cough does not always
attend phthisis when this disease exists; for example, I visited a
daughter of one of the distinguished gentlemen of Vermont.She had had
the bowel symptoms that indicated tubercular peritonitis for eight or
ten months, and the diagnosis was not {1167} difficult.Remembering
Louis's opinion that if tubercles invade any other part of the body,
they are likely to be found at the same time in the lungs and in a more
advanced condition, I examined the lungs, and found in the upper part
of the right a cavity so large that it could have received a fist.I
was only surprised by the fact that she did not cough, and had not
coughed.She herself assured me of that (she was twenty-one years old);
her physician, who was present at the visit, had never heard her cough,
and had no suspicion of any pulmonary complication; but, more than all,
her mother, who had walked with her, slept with her, eaten with her,
travelled with her, and from the beginning of the illness had not been
out of her company more than twenty minutes in any twenty-four hours
since the disease began, had never heard her cough.Here, then, the
nervous deviation to the abdomen, or whatever else it may have been,
had so benumbed the sensibility of the pulmonary nerves that the
alarm-bell of phthisis had never been sounded; but the cavity, had
there been any doubt whether the bowel disease was cancerous or
tuberculous, would have almost fully settled the question.But more of
the peculiarities of cancerous peritonitis a little farther on.The lesions of this disease (or its pathological anatomy) differ
considerably, but the differences are in the amount of tuberculous
deposit and the secondary results, not in the real nature of the
disease.Lebert has published among his plates of pathological anatomy
one which shows the peritoneum thickly sprinkled over with small
tuberculous grains, and represents each particular grain surrounded by
a little zone of inflammatory injection.There is yet no exudation, but
that would soon follow.A fibrinous exudation will soon come over this
primary deposit, and undergo a kind of organization, or at least get
blood-vessels, which in their turn can furnish the material for a new
crop of tubercles.These again provoke a new layer of fibrous tissue,
which also becomes studded with tubercles, and so on, till a thick
covering is formed over the intestines.But the same material is
interposed between their folds, separating one from another and
compressing them and diminishing their calibre; at the same time this
agglomerated mass is firmly adherent to the abdominal walls everywhere.The new material may have a thickness of half an inch or even more.I
remember how surprised and confused I was when I made my first
inspection of such a case.The abdominal walls were cut through, but
they could not be lifted from the intestines, but were firmly adherent
to something.They were carefully dissected off and the bowel cavity
(?)exposed; there was apparently an immense tumor filling the whole
space: no intestines, no viscera, could be seen.A section was made
through this mass from above downward, and another parallel with it and
an inch distant from it, and this part removed.It appeared like a
large, hard tumor, through which the intestine made several
perforations.The new material appeared to be fibrous, with
grayish-white tubercles sprinkled in through it everywhere, and pretty
abundantly.In another case this fibro-tubercular material may occupy
one part of the abdomen, and a large serous cyst or serous cysts
another.The tuberculo-fibrous material may be found in markedly less
quantity than is so far described, till there will be no more than in a
case from Ziemssen's clinique, quoted by Bauer: "In the peritoneal
cavity about four liters of yellowish-brown, slightly turbid fluid.Omentum {1168} thickened, stretched, adherent to the anterior wall of
the abdomen and beset with hemorrhages; the same was true of the
parietal peritoneum; between the hemorrhages whitish-yellow and
entirely white tubercles occur, varying in size from the head of a pin
to a lentil.The
intestines intensely inflated; a number of ulcers on the mucous
membrane, one approaching perforation.Covering of the liver thickened
by fibrinous deposition."The lungs and serous membranes generally will, in all probability, show
more or less of tubercular deposit, the pericardium less frequently
than the others.The result in this affection, after it is fully established, is
believed to be uniformly fatal, and at its commencement the difficulty
of diagnosis may lead one to doubt whether his apparent success is
anything better than apparent.Still, a plan which I have relied on is,
I believe, worth announcing.As soon as the disease is recognized the
patient is put upon the use of the iodide of potassium and the iodide
of iron, in full average doses, and a solution of iodine in olive oil
is applied to the whole surface of the abdomen by such gentle friction
as will produce no pain; and after a minute or two of such friction the
oil is brushed thinly over the surface and the whole covered with oiled
silk.The quantity of iodine to
an ounce of oil will vary considerably in different persons; for some,
seven to ten grains will be enough; for others, thirty will be needed.The iron is to make the application moderately irritating, and if it
produce pinhead blisters or blisters a little larger, all the better.When the application becomes painful the oil is washed off, and the
application is not renewed for two or three days.In this manner it may
be continued for two or three months.Meantime, the patient is put upon
the diet and regimen of the consumptive, the appetite encouraged; he
takes sustaining food, with plenty of milk and cream, or cod-liver oil,
as much fresh air as possible, and friction is applied to other parts
of the body with dry flannel.Benign tumors of the abdomen are not frequently the cause of general
peritonitis, and when they are, the grade of the disease is acute
rather than chronic.They very often provoke local inflammation and
become adherent to the neighboring structures.The same is true of
malignant growths in the abdominal cavity, except that the adhesions
are earlier formed and more likely to occur.Localized cancer, of
whatever variety, is not very prone to produce general peritonitis,
even though there be multiple developments of it.But when the disease
takes the disseminated form, and is sprinkled over the whole extent of
the peritoneum, then inflammation is almost certain to occur--not of
high grade, and yet deserving the name subacute rather than chronic.A
case which illustrates this statement has come under my observation
within the last year.I will recite it with sufficient detail to make
it intelligible.A lady about forty years of age had, up to the summer of 1881, enjoyed
very good health, though she was never robust.At that time she felt
her strength abating and her stomach disordered.She sought {1169}
health in various places, and took professional advice in September.It
availed her little; the bowels were gradually swelling and fluctuation
could be felt.There was not a
cachectic countenance, but the features were growing sharp.She had
suffered but little from pain till October.At that time she was at the
family country home.Then she began to suffer from a severe pain in the
left thigh; and this, it was noticed, increased as the accumulation in
the bowels increased, and at length her physician felt compelled to tap
her--not so much on account of great distension of the bowel as in the
hope of relieving the pain.He drew off nine quarts of gluey, viscid
fluid, and her pain was wholly relieved.Twelve or fifteen days after
this she was brought to her city home, and her city physician, seeing
that her case was a grave one, sought the aid of a distinguished
gynaecologist.She was then again tapped to give him a more
satisfactory examination.He found the ovaries considerably enlarged
and hard.They could not, however, be felt by pressing the fingers into
the pelvis from above--only by the vagina.I saw her on the 10th of
November.The fluid had again made considerable tumefaction of the
bowels, and she was again suffering great pain in the region of the
right kidney and in the leg of the same side, together with cramps.The
relief given by the first tapping induced us to propose its repetition.It was, however, delayed till the 14th, that the physician who had
tapped her before might be present and assist.The quantity of water
drawn was again nine quarts, and again the pains and spasms were
quieted.It was
nearly clear, reddish, of syrupy flow and consistence, and so viscid
that while a portion of it had remained on the slide of the microscope
long enough for the examination of its constituents the thin cover
became so firmly attached to the slide that it could not be removed
without breaking or long maceration.The albumen was so abundant that
the fluid was completely consolidated on boiling.Fibrinous threads
were running through it in great numbers, and here and there was a cell
of large size, round, granular, but not plumped up with granules, with
a nucleus barely less in size than the cell itself; its outer border
within, but only just within, the boundary or wall of the cell.It was
the nucleus that was granular, for there was little room for granules
between the nucleus and the cell wall.The vial containing the fluid
had been standing three or four hours for a sediment.This in a vial
four inches high occupied the lower half, and gave nothing to the
dropping-tube till the sedimentary matter was drawn into it by suction.This matter consisted of fibrillated fibrin in large quantity; a great
number of the cells just described, some grouped, but most separate or
single.There were pus-cells in moderate quantity, each having the
amoeboid movements, and a considerable number of red blood-corpuscles,
some of natural form, some crenate.Immediately after the tapping the flaccid condition of the abdominal
walls admitted an examination.A solid, hard mass was found running
across the upper part of the bowels, a nodule of which was lying on the
stomach at the point of the ensiform cartilage.A harder mass of
irregular shape was also found just above the pelvis on the right side,
extending upward and to the right.This was in extent two by three
inches.The ovary, however, could not be detected by pressure from
above {1170} downward.The diagnosis up to this time was hardly
doubtful, but these revelations made it complete, and crushed any
lingering hope of the patient's recovery.While the pain and spasm ceased after the tapping, the oedema of the
left leg, which came on some time before the last tapping, did not
diminish.The hard spot near the right iliac fossa was tender on
pressure, but otherwise hardly painful.While the fluid did not exceed
six quarts or so, she had little pain anywhere.There were no external
glandular swellings.Her appetite was poor, and she took but little
food.She vomited very little till the end was approaching.The urine
contained a few globules of pus, some pigment matter, two or three
hyaline casts, but no trace of albumen.For sixteen days following
November 14th the patient was comfortable, but the fluid was slowly
filling the bowels again.At that time the pains already referred to
began to return.On December 5th they required another tapping, and
preparations were made for it, but vomiting, rather severe, led to its
postponement to the next day.The quantity of fluid drawn was nine and
a half quarts.It was of the same syrupy consistence as that previously
drawn, and under the microscope showed exactly the same constituents
and gave the same quantity of albumen.The next day stercoraceous
vomiting commenced, with no movement of the bowels, except what was
produced by 10 grains of calomel given on the second day of this
vomiting.She after
this took no food by the mouth, but milk and beef-tea were injected
into the rectum.Still, the fecal vomiting returned, and she died on
the 15th.The post-mortem examination was made on the 17th by William H. Welch.His report is complete as to the main features of
the case, though it does not furnish an explanation of the spasms and
the oedema of the left leg, regarding which Welch was not informed.The
pain and spasm were doubtless due to backward pressure of a diseased
part on a nerve or nerves, and the oedema to a narrowing of the iliac
vein by pressure or constriction by fibro-cancerous matter on its outer
sides."The peritoneal cavity," he says, "contained somewhat over a
gallon of clear, yellow serum.Both the visceral and parietal layers of
the peritoneum were thickened, in some places more than in others; this
was especially marked on the anterior of the stomach and on the lower
part of the ileum and in the left iliac region.The omentum was greatly
thickened and retracted into a firm mass (or roll), which extended
somewhat obliquely across the body, more to the left than to the right.The mesentery was much thickened and contracted, drawing the intestines
backward.In a few places only was the peritoneal surface coated with
fibrin, and the intestines were mostly free from adhesions.The coils
of the lower part of the ileum, however, were firmly matted together by
organized connective tissue in such a way that they were twisted, often
at a sharp angle, so as greatly to constrict the calibre of the gut.The serous and muscular layers of the intestine at this point were
greatly thickened.By these causes there appeared to be a complete
obstruction at a point about six inches above the ileo-caecal valve.By
careful dissection these coils were straightened out, so as to remove
the main cause of obstruction.The peritoneal covering of the liver was
adherent to the parietal layer.{1171} "The surface of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum was
studded over with hundreds of small, firm, whitish nodules, generally
not larger than a pea, and often not larger than a pin's head.In some
places they had coalesced and made firm patches an inch in extent.This
same material was found in the contracted omentum in considerable
quantity.In a few places, particularly on the uterus, a blackish
pigmented deposit appeared."The ovaries were not adherent, but both were enlarged to the size of a
hen's egg.The outer surface of each was rough and corrugated.The new
growth was deposited on the exterior and penetrated each a quarter to
half an inch.It was of uniform white color and of firm consistence."The stomach wall was thickened nearly throughout its extent, but
particularly in the anterior part, where it amounted to thrice the
normal thickness.This consisted wholly of hypertrophy of the muscular
coat and increase of fibrous tissue in the peritoneal layer.This new
growth was traced, in the interlacing bands, from the surface into the
muscular coat.In the outer layer of the stomach were found three small
white nodules.The mucous membrane of the organ was healthy or a little
pale."The retro-peritoneal glands along the aorta were enlarged, soft, and
of a reddish-gray color.A nodule was found in the wall of the duodenum
outside the mucous membrane, and one in the Fallopian tube."Every organ in the abdomen and chest was examined, but nothing
important found except what is here recorded.Welch concludes his
record with the following diagnosis: "Primary scirrhous carcinoma of
the ovaries.Secondary deposits in the peritoneum, in the outer layer
of the right Fallopian tube, of the stomach and duodenum, and in the
retro-peritoneal glands.This case presents to the reader so accurately the usual course of
cancerous peritonitis, and the inspection its lesions, that a treatise
on the subject is hardly called for.It often happens that cancerous
antecedents in the patient or his relatives will lend an aid to the
diagnosis, which this case did not present.To distinguish this disease
from tubercular peritonitis no question can arise except in its
dropsical form, and then the lungs in every case of the latter that I
have met with have the physical signs of tubercles, though not always
the rational indications.The pulse is much more accelerated in the
tuberculous variety.I omitted to state that the temperature of this
patient was often taken, and till the closing scene was never found
more than one or two degrees above the healthy standard, and the
morning and evening heat did not materially vary; the opposite of both,
then, would be expected in a tuberculous case.The existence of
meteorism is much more common in the tubercular disease; indeed, in the
cancerous case recited there was none of it.The duration of the two is
different--that of the cancerous kind is recorded in months, while the
tuberculous variety may continue two years.The cancerous is more
likely to be attended by alarming accidents, like the complete
obstruction of the bowels, large hemorrhages, and a sudden lighting up
of acute peritonitis.Finally, in the light of the case here recorded,
it seems probable that the examination of the abdominal fluid will
become of great importance.I have never carefully examined the fluid
of tubercular dropsy, but it does not seem probable that it will have
the syrupy {1172} appearance, the large amount of albumen, the
abundance of fibrin-fibres, and the granular large cells with nuclei
only perceptibly less in size than the cells themselves, that were
repeatedly found in this case--found by two observers, and at every
tapping after the first.TREATMENT cannot be curative; it therefore consists of such
administrations as will relieve pain, give sleep, improve the appetite,
increase the flow of urine if it be scanty, and relieve the bowels if
there is a tendency to constipation.It is as much the duty of the
physician to put off the fatal day, when he can, in incurable
affections as it is to cure those that will yield to his prescription
and advice.In the case just narrated opium or an opiate alone produced
such unpleasant after-effects that she was unwilling to take it, but
when the extract of belladonna was given with it she slept pleasantly,
and could take her food the next day.Infantile Peritonitis, or Peritonitis of Childhood.Bauer, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia of Practice of Medicine_, and
Wardell, in _Reynolds's System of Medicine_, have each devoted a
chapter to this form of disease.They refer to the fact that the foetus
may have peritonitis before birth or be born with it, or may have it
when a few days old.They say that this form of the disease occurs most
frequently in lying-in asylums or foundling hospitals, and that it has
been supposed to depend on a syphilitic taint.They say, too, that it
follows erysipelas, scarlet fever, measles, etc.I do not perceive that
the description of either of these authors makes any marked distinction
between this and the same disease in adults, except what may arise from
the inability of the infant to describe its sensations, and the more
rapid course of the disease to a fatal result--in some cases
twenty-four hours.Having myself had no obstetrical practice, or next
to none, I have nothing to add to their statements, and can from my own
knowledge abate nothing.I therefore refer the reader to these
chapters, and to the references given by the first of these authors,
for a fuller knowledge of the matter.Regarding the comparative exemption of children, after the first few
weeks of life, from spontaneous peritonitis, referred to by one of
these authors, I can fully confirm his statement.Though I have
assisted in the treatment of many children suffering from peritonitis,
I have difficulty in recalling to mind a single case in which the
disease was not caused by perforation of the intestine or vermiform
appendix of the caecum, and in much the greatest frequency perforation
of the appendix.B. F. Dawson,[11] after reciting a case in which the liver had
undergone a peculiar degeneration and was attended by peritonitis
before birth, states that Sir J. Y. Simpson observed nine cases in his
own practice "and notes more than a dozen from different sources."These cases seemed to have been caused by the ill-health of the mother
during gestation, or excessive labor, injuries, venereal disease, and
were mostly attended by grave disease; the viscera often, the liver;
but sometimes the mother was perfectly healthy, and the peritonitis was
the primary disease.Death almost always occurred in utero or shortly
after birth.Record_ takes the following from _Schmidt's
Jahrbucher_ for Jan.Oscar Silbermann recognizes two
varieties of peritonitis in the new-born.The non-septic or chronic is
developed usually in the first third of foetal life, and is generally
syphilitic in origin.If the peritoneum covering the intestines be
involved, as well as that over the liver and spleen, various forms of
intestinal obstruction may result.Most frequently there is occlusion
of the anus, less often stenosis or complete stricture of the small
intestine.Of a number of cases of congenital occlusion of the
intestine collected by the author, all ended fatally, only one living
beyond twelve days."The second, acute or septic, form of peritonitis in the new-born the
author divides into two varieties, according as the peritonitis is only
a part of general infection or is the sole manifestation of the septic
poison.In either case the point of entrance of the poison is always
the navel wound.The symptoms, which need not all be present in a given
case, are vomiting, watery stools, meteorism, ascites, abdominal
tenderness, icterus, etc.The pulse and temperature may vary in degree
in different cases.A cure of the septic form is possible; therefore
the treatment should be carefully considered.The navel wound should be
cleansed, and the child is to be isolated from its mother.To control
the fever quinine may be given.Priessnitz's sheet is of value;
vomiting may be checked by chloral (one-half to one grain in water).The strength should of course be maintained by stimulants if
necessary."The accumulation of fluid indicated by this name has already been
referred to in its relations to several causes.There are, however,
conditions producing it which have not been considered or only
considered partially.The most prolific source of abdominal dropsy is obstruction of the
portal circulation on its way to or through the liver.Condensation of
the liver structure in cirrhosis, with destruction of many of the
portal capillaries and compression of many more, is prominent in this
connection.The compression of the liver caused by an adventitious
external covering, referred to under the head of Local Peritonitis,
acts similarly, whether it compresses the vein at its entrance into the
liver or not, although it is not known to produce any destruction of
the portal capillaries.Some enlargements of the organ are attended by
the same result, but they are always associated with a hardening of its
structure.The disease lately called waxy liver, now often denominated
lardaceous, belongs to this class, as does that condition in which the
organ is enlarged, hardened, and fissured, regarded as syphilitic
liver.That both these diseases may have a syphilitic and mercurial
origin is not a point now under consideration.They both harden the
hepatic structure and obstruct the portal circulation, while they may
not in equal degree hinder the progress of arterial blood.This is
explained when we remember the diminished force that propels the portal
blood.Neither of these diseases produces dropsy early in its progress,
but, as I have seen it, always before it reaches its fatal termination.Fatty liver has not, in my observation, produced dropsy, {1174}
although I have seen livers made very large by that disease, and the
absence of dropsy when the liver has been large has aided me in
distinguishing it from the waxy disease.Cancer of the liver in some
instances does, and in others does not, produce dropsy of the bowels.It is only certain to have this result when a tumor is in position to
press upon and obstruct the portal.Hypertrophy of the liver, caused by
mitral regurgitation or other disease of the heart, does not generally
produce dropsy, but, aided by anaemia or watery condition of the blood,
such a result is possible.In children, however, it is not very rare to
see the bowels distended by dropsy, and to discover that the liver is
enlarged at the same time.It is common in such cases that the dropsy
and the hypertrophy disappear after a few weeks of treatment.This may
occur in a child that is anaemic, but without any disease of the heart.Such a case was brought to me two or three months ago, and after four
weeks of treatment by tonics and diuretics the health was
re-established.There is one point in these cases of some importance.When the child lies on his back, if the abdomen is much distended, the
liver cannot be felt.It has sunk away into the fluid, and in this
position ordinary percussion cannot ascertain its dimensions.In the
July number (1840) of a quarterly journal edited by Swett and Watson, I
published an article in which I reported the conjoined labors of the
late Camman and myself on a new method of combining auscultation and
percussion, with its results, under the heading "Auscultatory
Percussion."By the method described in that article--viz.by placing a
solid stethoscope, or for that Laennec's first stethoscope, a rolled-up
pamphlet, on the chest at a point where the liver has not fallen away
from its walls, and percussing on the abdomen from below upward--a
point is reached whence the percussion sound is brought sharply to the
ear, while half an inch below the sound is dull and distant.The lower
edge of the liver is thus easily recognized, and its upper boundary is
found in a similar manner or by ordinary percussion, so the difficulty
of measurement disappears.In such case, when the dropsy disappears and the liver recovers its
natural dimensions at the same time, the inference is that the
hypertrophy caused the dropsy, and that the hypertrophy was of the kind
called simple.The nutmeg liver is thought to have an agency in
producing dropsy, but as it is for the most part associated with
diseases that have been called dropsy-producing, its bearing on this
effusion may yet be regarded as uncertain.It is common to speak of heart dropsy in such a way as to imply that
disease of the heart alone can produce abdominal effusion.I even doubt whether the heart alone can cause the anasarca that is so
often attributed to it.In following a great multitude of heart
diseases from the time they were recognized to their termination, I
have been struck with the ease with which the patients attend to their
business, sometimes even laborious business, for years--in one instance
fifty years--with almost no complaint, and how rapidly their condition
changes as soon as albumen and casts appear in the urine.I have been
compelled by these observations to ascribe the anasarca and oedema that
makes this last stage of heart disease so distressing to the kidneys,
and not to the heart.Double pleuritic effusion is not uncommon under
these circumstances, but every physician must have noticed the rareness
of troublesome abdominal {1175} dropsy, while there is
sometimes--perhaps often--a little effusion; and when in the
exceptional cases there has been much, it was almost always accounted
for by a dropsy-producing change in the abdominal organs, not, perhaps,
discovered during life; so that for me, while they produce overwhelming
effusions in other parts of the system, they are minor agents in the
production of ascites.Phthisis is occasionally attended, toward its
close, by oedematous legs and albuminous urine, but I cannot report any
important relation between these and peritoneal effusion.I can say the
same of chronic bronchitis.I record this negative testimony regarding
the two last-named diseases, because I find them enumerated among the
causes of abdominal dropsy.Cancer may invade the portal vein, tumors of adjacent parts other than
those of the liver, or an aneurism may compress it and cause dropsy.Diseases of the pelvic organs, both acute
and chronic, may produce it, but then the disease would fall into the
class of those produced by chronic or subacute peritonitis.DaCosta thinks he has lately had a case of chronic peritonitis attended
by ascites.It was in a woman thirty years of age, who had been thrown
with force upon the frame of an iron bedstead, striking the lower part
of the bowels.These were not confined to
the injured part, but extended to the whole abdomen; and there was
menorrhagia.After a time there was fluid effusion in the peritoneal
cavity, which slowly increased till her state demanded relief from
tapping.The pain and
tenderness were constant symptoms all through.She slowly improved, and
at the time the case was reported it was believed that she would soon
be discharged from the hospital.The only doubt which DaCosta finds
regarding the diagnosis is in the facts that the liver was diminished
in size and that the spleen was moderately enlarged, and he admits the
possibility that an adventitious capsule of the liver may have caused
the ascites, but believes that it was dependent on chronic peritonitis.Acute peritonitis subsiding into chronic, with increase of fluid
effusion, as I have already said, I am not familiar with.That
occurring in cancerous and tuberculous peritonitis has already been
considered.But in relation to these some facts regarding frequency of
occurrence, collected by Bristowe, are worth quoting.He says that in
48 cases of tubercular peritonitis, dropsy was found in 12, and that in
22 of peritoneal cancer, 12 had more or less ascites.He further adds,
regarding cirrhosis, that of 46 cases observed post-mortem, there was
dropsy in only 20.This is not surprising, as in all the diseased
conditions of the liver that produce dropsy the anatomical changes must
reach the point at which there is considerable portal obstruction
before the effusion will occur.The amount of fluid found in ascites varies greatly.In some it may
remain for a long time stationary at four or five quarts; in others the
suffering caused by an accumulation of nine or ten quarts will demand
its removal; and in a few cases twenty quarts have been removed in one
operation.It is in cirrhosis that the largest quantity is found, and
it is in this disease and in cancerous peritonitis that the most
frequent tappings are required.The quality of the fluid also varies
markedly: from being almost as clear and thin as spring-water it may be
almost ropy, or in color greenish or yellowish or slightly red; it is
very likely to contain {1176} albumen; and it is probable that a
further study of its microscopic elements may enable us to resolve
doubts regarding the cause of the effusion.It very often contains
blood-corpuscles.Bristowe finds from hospital records that ascites occurs in about equal
frequency in males and females, but, as everybody has noticed, that
hepatic dropsy is much more frequent in men than in women.Ascites, he
says, is most frequent between the ages of thirty and fifty, and next
between twenty and thirty and between fifty and sixty, but is not
uncommon above the latter age; and it occurs in children.SYMPTOMS.--In general, ascites is easily recognized by the swollen
state of the bowels: a well-rounded swelling when the patient stands or
sits, but spread out in the flanks when he lies on his back; the
fulness of the side on which the patient may be lying, and the
flattened condition of the opposite side,--belong to this disease, and
as a group to no other.The results of percussion are significant in
the movement it causes in the fluid, and for the resonance or flatness
it produces.When the patient lies on his back, tapping with the
finger-ends on one side of the abdomen sends a wave of the fluid across
to the other side, where it is perceived as a gentle blow by the
applied fingers of the other hand.If the abdomen is not full, this
wave will be produced at the upper level of the fluid, but not above
that.If this wave cannot be sent across the body, it may be found on
either side by percussing above and feeling for it below; percussion
also teaches where the fluid is, and where it is not, by the dull sound
it produces.It is rare in ascites that the intestines do not float on
the surface of the fluid, at least from the umbilicus upward, and there
give a loud percussion sound, while toward the back, and often toward
the pelvis, it is dull, or even flat; changing the position of the
body, the resonance will be uppermost and the dulness in the most
dependent part.Then the softness or impressibility of the abdomen till
the tension becomes great is noticeable.The changed position of the
fluid as the body is turned from side to side is important.A very
small quantity of fluid can be detected in this manner.The patient is
placed on his right side and percussion is made in the right flank:
there is dulness, while in the left flank there is resonance.The
patient turns on to the left side: dulness now changes position, and is
on the left, and on the right resonance.If it is feared that some
undetected fluid remains in the pelvic cavity, the pelvis may be raised
by pillows and the same examination repeated, or he may be placed in
the knee-and-elbow position referred to by Bristowe, and the percussion
will then be made upward in the umbilical region.In some cases the
contraction of the mesentery will not allow the intestines to rise
through a large amount of fluid and float on it; but such cases are
almost confined to the cancerous and the tuberculous varieties of the
disease; and as in these the symptoms are grave, the physician will
probably have visited his patient many times before this contraction
will embarrass him.Besides, when mesenteric contraction occurs there
is a very strong probability that the omentum will also be contracted,
be rolled up, and lumpy; as this can almost always be felt above the
level of the umbilicus, he has in it an explanation of the absence of
resonance on the fluid.It has happened that oedema of the abdominal
walls or fatty accumulations there have given a delusive though feeble
fluctuation on percussion.In such cases, if the patient make moderate
pressure with the back of a small book in {1177} the course of the
median line, that kind of wave will be broken, while a wave in the
abdominal cavity will not be prevented.When there is considerable
distension of the abdomen by fluid, weak spots in the abdominal wall
often yield and make a tumor.This is very common at the umbilicus,
where a little bladder is lifted half an inch or more above the general
curve of the abdomen.The fluid frequently follows the track of
hernias.In females it has been known to press the anterior wall of the
vagina backward and downward, so as to make it protrude at the vulva.It has, in one of my own cases, by downward pressure caused complete
prolapse of the uterus.It is very often attended by oedema of the
lower limbs.This is accounted for by the pressure of the abdominal
fluid on the veins that return the blood from these parts, or in
cirrhosis by contraction of the ring or notch through which the vena
cava passes in the liver.If there is general oedema, the cause will
probably be found in disease of the kidneys; or if in one limb, in
pressure or thrombosis of one iliac vein.As the disease advances the
accumulating fluid forces the diaphragm upward, diminishes the
breathing room, and threatens the life still more.Then the patient
cannot lie down in bed, but spends his nights as well as days in an
easy-chair, and sleeps leaning forward on a support for his forehead.The veins on the abdominal surface will fix attention.With almost any
large tumor in the cavity they become more or less enlarged.But in
cirrhotic dropsy this becomes more striking than in any other
affection.The enlargement is attended by a reversion of the
blood-current on the lower half of the abdomen.This is early shown by
emptying an inch or two of a vein with the finger, drawing it either
upward or downward, and noticing from which direction it is refilled
when the pressure is removed.The pelvic veins do not readily discharge
their blood by the natural channels, and by anastomosing branches it is
forced over the surface of the abdomen and into the thoracic veins,
these latter becoming in turn greatly enlarged.The appetite is
commonly poor, the digestion flatulent, the pulse accelerated.The urine is commonly scanty, and in
cirrhosis of a reddish hue.The skin is apt to be dry, particularly so
in simple chronic peritonitis.The tongue has no characteristic fur,
and is often, almost always toward the close, dry.The mind is not
affected till near the end; then often the patient is delirious,
commonly mildly.Diarrhoea is not uncommon, and even dysentery has been
observed.The result is almost always unfavorable, or, as has been
said, lethal.When, as in chronic peritonitis
and in tuberculous peritonitis, the fluid is confined in a sac or sacs,
each particular pool will be yielding to pressure, but elastic, and
will give the percussion wave, though it may extend but a short
distance.To distinguish ovarian dropsy--ovarian cysts, as it is now
called--from ascites may require a few words.Ovarian tumors of all
kinds are found to be more prominent on one side when they rise from
the pelvis than on the other.The
uterus and its appendages lie in front of the pelvic intestine, and
when any of them ascend above the pelvis they must occupy the same
relative position.In other words, a large ovarian cyst must lie in
front of the intestines, while intestinal resonance should be found
behind and in the sides.But if the ovarian cyst does not occupy the
whole height of the bowels, intestinal resonance {1178} may exist above
it, and the dulness may be found below, bounded by a portion of a
circle, and sometimes the cyst walls are resisting enough to allow its
boundaries to be ascertained by the fingers.This cyst can also be felt
in the vagina; and the uterus, instead of being pressed down, is
sometimes lifted upward, so that it cannot be reached in the vagina,
but can be felt through the abdominal walls just above the pelvic
bones.A condition more troublesome than this is when ovarian cyst and
ascites occur together.Then the posterior or lateral resonance is lost
when the patient lies on her back, but can be found on one side when
she lies on the other.In that concurrence, in dorsal decubitus it is
possible by pressure or a little blow to send a wave of the ascitic
fluid over the front of the cyst.Should the patient take the knee-and-elbow position, the intestinal
resonance may be restored in both flanks.TREATMENT.--In opening the chapter on the treatment of ascites it is
usually said, Give principal consideration to the diseased conditions
that have caused the dropsy; in other words, cure cirrhosis, cancerous
peritonitis, tubercular peritonitis, heart disease, and the secondary
affections of the abdominal organs, release the liver from the
dangerous compression to which it is subjected, and all will go well.But they do not inform us how these impossibilities--at least in most
cases impossibilities--are to be achieved.It is true that the
physician would not shrink hopelessly from the treatment of simple
chronic peritonitis.But this is one of the rarest causes of ascites.A
physician in a long lifetime may not have seen a case.It is true,
ascites is a symptom, always a secondary, or even a tertiary,
affection; and theoretically there can be no better advice, but
practically it cannot amount to much.Then, if the cause cannot be
removed, it remains to do our best to relieve the patient of his load
and strive to prolong his life to its utmost possible limit.In doing
this the physician will often find himself able to give gratifying
relief, and once in a great while to rejoice in a cure.The three great emunctories, the skin, the bowels, and the kidneys, are
chiefly appealed to for relief in this as in other serous
accumulations.Most physicians prefer to use the diuretics--first,
because if they will act at all, they act so quietly and produce so
little debility that whatever can be gained by them is obtained at
small cost to the system.The form of ascites that most resists
diuretics is that which originates in cirrhosis.Often a full trial of
them, with suitable changes from time to time, is of no avail, yet now
and then the kidneys yield to persuasion and act freely.The saline
diuretics and digitalis are most in favor with some.In the early part
of the present century a pill composed of squill and digitalis in
powder, and calomel, each one grain, given three times a day, was
almost universally chosen.In place of the calomel the blue mass was
often preferred.When this prescription had produced a little ptyalism
the mercurial was omitted and the squill and digitalis continued.It
has often been observed in dropsies of all kinds that diuretics act
better after a little mercurial action is set up in the system.The
diuretic that I most frequently prescribe is made of the carbonate of
potass.ounce ss and water ounce vj; to a tablespoonful of this a
tablespoonful of fresh lemon-juice is added.This is taken every two
hours, and at the same time a dessertspoonful of the infusion of
digitalis or more is taken three times a day.This is an {1179} old
prescription.Sometimes the old sal diureticus is used.It is not always kindly received by the stomach.At Bellevue Hospital the following is much used: viz.infusion of
digitalis, ounce iv; bitartrate of potash, ounce j; simple syrup, ounce
ss; and water added to make a pint.But it
would require many pages to exhaust the diuretics.I will only add that
I have more confidence in the salts of potash and soda, singly or
combined, aided by digitalis and a mercurial, than in any others.The diaphoretics that are most efficient are warm water and steam.A
foot-bath long continued and frequently repeated, the patient covered
with blankets, and the water kept at 90 degrees or warmer, are very
effectual in producing perspiration.Bricks heated or hot water in
bottles, or potatoes heated, and enveloped in damp cloths and laid
alongside of the body and limbs, form an extemporaneous vapor-bath of
considerable efficiency.A vapor-bath can be easily extemporized in the
following way: Have a kitchen vessel furnished by the tinman with a
cover which has an inch tube fitted to this and bent so as reach the
floor six feet from the fire.The pot should have a capacity of a
gallon or more, and should be kept boiling briskly.Meantime, the
patient, in his night-dress, has a double blanket brought over his
shoulders from behind, and another from before, and fastened.Now he
takes a chair (wooden), under which the steam is delivered.The blanket
from behind is kept off his body by the back of the chair, and the
front one by his knees.The steam, shut in in this way, soon brings on
a sweat, and when it is sufficiently active the front blanket is thrown
off, and the patient wrapped in the rear one and put to bed, when the
sweating can be regulated by blankets.This is better than what is
called the alcohol sweat, for in that the patient is bathed in carbonic
acid gas as well as heat.A patient is sometimes enveloped in a hot,
wet blanket with good effect.Pilocarpine has come into use lately as a
sudorific.I have witnessed its effects many times and can testify to
its certainty as a sudorific; but it is too debilitating for common
use.Digitalis has sometimes acted with extraordinary power in this
way, but there are grave risks in administering large doses.Among the cathartics that may be used in ascites, it has seemed to me
that the milder hydragogues are safest.One ounce of Epsom salts with a
drachm of the fluid extract of senna can be taken every second or third
day for months, if need be, with little reduction of strength, and
sometimes with an increase of it.I had charge of a young man in the
hospital in whom cirrhosis was unquestionable, and dropsy at one time
extreme, in whom the abdominal veins had made furrows that would
receive the little finger, who was wholly relieved by a drastic dose of
elaterium every second day.I saw him three years after his discharge,
and then his health was good.Notwithstanding this, I prefer the milder
medicines.Bristowe has seen no cures from either sudorifics, diuretics, or
purgatives.I have seen one or more from each of those agents, all
cirrhotic.He "has seen cures occasionally from mercury, iodide and
bromide of potash, copaiba, and a combination of fresh squills and
crude mercury."I agree with him in his statement that
counter-irritants are useless, making exception for chronic peritonitis
and the early stage of the tubercular variety.He thinks quinia, iron,
and cod-liver oil are useful.{1180} Paracentesis in almost every case will at length become
necessary, and the question comes whether it should be practised early
or late.If it be delayed till the oppression of the breathing makes it
imperative, the walls of the abdomen will be so stretched as to present
little resistance to the reaccumulation of the fluid, and a second
tapping will be required in fifteen to twenty-five days.A bandage is a
poor substitute for muscular contraction.If, on the other hand, the
fluid is withdrawn before the muscularity is not stretched out of the
muscles, then accumulation will be less rapid and the patient will be
spared the suffering which large accumulations cause.But tapping is
not always an innocent operation.It is sometimes followed by acute
peritonitis.By the early tapping this risk is oftener taken.Reginald
Smith suggests the use of a small canula by which only ten or twenty
ounces of the fluid can escape each hour.This mode, he thinks, removes
the danger of syncope and makes the bandage needless.Hemorrhagic Effusion

in the peritoneum is a topic on which there is little to be said.A
primary effusion of this kind probably does not occur.In
haematophilia, where the mucous membrane of the nose and wounds bleed
dangerously, there is no record of spontaneous bleeding into the
peritoneal cavity.The same thing can be said of that very rare disease
which has been called bloody sweat.An unmarried lady applied to me
fifteen years ago with this disorder.The blood would ooze out at
hundreds of points on the inner face of the arm; these would run
together and drop off the arm, or the same thing would occur on the
chest and in the bend of the knee.This would continue for two or three
minutes, and then cease of itself, but to recur in one or more, rarely
several, places.There was no
irregularity of the menses.I could find no visceral disease; there was
no nose-bleed.This kind of
bleeding continued for several years.She is now approaching fifty
years of age, and for the last two or three years has had no recurrence
of the bleeding.There was never anything in this case to lead to the
suspicion of peritoneal or other serous hemorrhage.In the few similar
cases on record there is the same absence of all evidence of internal
bleeding.It has already been said that a certain amount of blood, as shown by
its corpuscles, is to be expected in cancerous ascites, and with less
uniformity in tubercular ascites, and not unfrequently in hepatic
dropsy, as well as in acute peritonitis.This may not deserve to be
called hemorrhage, on account of the moderate quantity of blood that is
effused; but aside from that which results from rupture of
blood-vessels it is about the only kind of it with which we are
familiar.Scurvy, and conditions of the blood analogous to those produced by that
disease, make it almost certain that if pleurisy or pericarditis occurs
while these conditions exist, it will be hemorrhagic.I am not,
personally, acquainted with a single instance in which peritonitis in
this condition has occurred.Copeland, however, says that hemorrhage in
peritonitis has been noticed by Broussais and others.The blood is
mixed {1181} with the serum and stains the surface of the false
membrane, as in hemorrhagic pleurisy and pericarditis, and the disease
is of an asthenic type, "occurring in the hemorrhagic diathesis.""The
symptoms are inflammatory from the beginning, and rapidly pass into
those indicating great depression; the pulse becomes rapid, small, and
soft, death quickly supervening, with convulsions, cold and damp
extremities and surface," etc.Copeland has himself not seen a case, and regards its occurrence as
very rare.Delafield states that "Friedreich describes two cases
occurring in patients with ascites who had been frequently tapped.He
says that both the parietal and visceral peritoneum was covered with a
continuous membrane of a diffuse, yellowish-brown color, mottled with
small and large extravasations of blood.The membrane was thickest over
the anterior abdominal wall.It could be separated into a number of
layers.These layers were composed of blood-vessels, masses of pigment,
branching cells, and fibrillated basement substance.In many places the
extravasated blood was coagulated in the shape of round, hard, black
nodules.The new membrane could be readily stripped off from the
peritoneum, and there were no adhesions between the visceral and
parietal portions of the peritoneum."The erosions of abdominal cancer sometimes open vessels of considerable
size, causing large hemorrhage into this cavity and sudden death.When aneurisms of the abdominal aorta rupture, they sometimes flood the
abdominal cavity; oftener they open into the structures under the
peritoneum on the left side, and make a large flat tumor extending from
the point of rupture downward to the brim of the pelvis, and even
beyond it.A gentleman whose health was usually good, thirty-five years of age,
felt an unwonted exhaustion and feebleness creeping over him.His
countenance became pale, his pulse rapid, growing smaller and smaller.It seemed certain that there was hemorrhage somewhere, but until it was
noticed that the bowels were growing tumid and hard there was nothing
to guide us to its seat.Even then we were left to conjecture regarding
the bleeding vessel.After
death it was found that a small aneurism had been formed on one of the
vessels of the omentum, not larger than a small walnut, and had
ruptured by a very small opening, and that it was by this small opening
that life had oozed away.Bleedings from stabs and other wounds of the bowels, from lacerations
of the liver, spleen, uterus, and sometimes of the kidneys, should be
mentioned in this connection; but as they, for the most part, fall into
the hands of the surgeons, this is not the place to give the details
regarding them.{1182}

DISEASES OF THE ABDOMINAL GLANDS (TABES MESENTERICA).BY SAMUEL C. BUSEY, M.D.DEFINITION.--Tabes mesenterica may be briefly defined to be
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.This definition may seem too
limited, because it recognizes the identity of tuberculosis and
scrofulosis of the lymph-glands, and excludes those hyperplastic
conditions which do not certainly undergo the cheesy degeneration.It
is supported, however, by the absence of any essential difference in
the histological changes which take place in tuberculous and scrofulous
(Wagner) lymph-glands; by the frequent simultaneous occurrence of each
in the same subject; by the secondary development of tubercles during
the course of scrofulous affections; and by the fact that the cheesy
transformation is alike common to both these conditions of new
formations.Schuppel maintains that the presence of tubercles is
necessary to the production of the cheesy metamorphosis of
lymph-glands, and that "scrofulous glands are always tuberculous
glands."In this view Rindfleisch coincides, and expresses the belief
that the inflammatory and hyperplastic changes are secondary to the
formation of the tubercles.Birch-Hirschfeld asserts that cheesy
degeneration of the mesenteric glands is always accompanied by
tubercular formations.This definition is therefore adopted as the expression of the result of
the most recent investigations.It must, nevertheless, be admitted that
a few equally competent observers deny the identity of the tuberculous
and scrofulous new formations in lymph-glands.It must also be conceded
that occasionally hyperplastic processes in the lymph-glands undergo
the cheesy metamorphosis independent of tubercular development.SYNONYMS.--The differences of opinion, especially among the older
authors, in regard to the nature of this disease are very distinctly
indicated in the varying significance of the numerous synonyms, of
which the following list is only a part: Atrophia mesenterica; Atrophia
infantum (Hoffmann); Febris hectica infantum (Sydenham); Scrofula
mesenterica (Sauvages); Paralysma mesentericum (Good); Physconia
mesenterica (Baumes); Mesenteritis chronica (Stewart); Mesenteric
fever, Hectic fever, Marasmus (Underwood); Carreau, Entero-mesenterite
of the French; Darrsucht der Kinder and Gekroschwindsucht of the
Germans; Tubercles of the mesentery; Tuberculous disease of the
abdomen; Phthisis mesenterica; Tabes glandularis; Tabes scrofulosa;
Macies infantum; Paedatrophia; and Rachialgia mesenterica.{1183} Some of these synonyms indicate the theoretical and unsupported
opinions of their authors, and others refer merely to a symptom.The
name carreau refers to a hardness of the abdomen; physconia, to the
presence of a non-fluctuating and non-sonorous abdominal tumor; and
that of entero-mesenterite presupposes a secondary origin from a
primary enteritis.Good classes it among his numerous varieties of
mesenteric turgescence, but characterizes this special form as a
scrofulous turgescence always associated with the strumous diathesis.The terms tabes and atrophy originated when the nomenclature of disease
was derived from symptoms, and not from pathology.HISTORY AND PATHOLOGY.--The history of tabes mesenterica is coeval with
that of scrofula and pulmonary consumption.The ancient authors
recognized the existence of a chronic disease of the mesenteric glands,
characterized by enlargement and induration, followed by destruction of
the gland-parenchyma, which was associated with digestive disturbances,
emaciation, hectic fever, and usually terminated in death.At first,
the degenerative process was regarded as suppurative.But as the study
of scrofula progressed, and frequent observations were made of the
occurrence of disease of the external lymphatics and of the mesenteric
glands in the same subject, disputes arose as to the identity of the
two affections.These controversies led to the general acceptance of
the belief that the scrofulous degeneration of lymph-glands and the
process of destruction in tabes mesenterica were identical.Consentaneous with these investigations, and for a long time
subsequent, even down to a very late period, which is, perhaps, not yet
concluded, the relation of scrofulous disease of the lymph-glands to
pulmonary consumption was discussed and studied with great assiduity.As the knowledge concerning these diseases advanced, and the results of
investigations were accepted, the doctrine of the identity of the
morbid processes in scrofulous disease of the external glands and
mesenteric phthisis became firmly established.The history of
scrofulosis and tuberculosis cannot be separated.The connection and
identification of the two processes have been subjects of constant
discussion from the discovery of tubercle to the present time.Occasionally, the dividing-line seemed definitely fixed.Then would
follow the general acceptance of the doctrine of identity.With the
discovery of miliary tubercle a determined reaction took place against
this view, and for a while many regarded scrofulosis merely as a form
or stage of tuberculosis.As the conclusions in regard to these
questions changed, so did the opinions concerning the true nature of
tabes mesenterica change, until, finally, the investigations of
Rindfleisch, Schuppel, and others seem to have established the
tuberculous nature of the disease.Many authors of a comparatively
recent date have applied the term tuberculosis to this condition, not
because they knew or believed the development of true tubercle was a
constant or essential characteristic, but because they regarded the
words scrofulosis and tuberculosis as synonymous.Notwithstanding the obscurity in which, for so long a time, the
pathology of this disease was involved, certain facts well known to the
earliest writers have been confirmed by continuous observation down to
the present.Its secondary character has been so uniformly recognized
that some of the older authors based its origin upon the absorption and
conveyance along the lymphatic vessels to the glands of some peccant
material originating {1184} in a primary focus of disease.The constant
coexistence with scrofulous affections and pulmonary consumption had
long ago established the direct and primary relation of these diseases
to tabes mesenterica, and authors of recent date, though not so
generally holding the opinion that it is always an intercurrent
complication of these maladies, yet maintain its secondary development.Even Schuppel, whose investigations and conclusions lead in the
direction of an idiopathic origin, admits that the only primary element
is the tuberculosis, which finds its cause in some peripheral
irritation.In the earlier times, as now, tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands has
been observed during every period of life from birth to advanced old
age, but then, as at the present time, the greater number of cases were
known to occur during infancy and childhood.But few cases have been
observed during the earlier months of life or before weaning.Between
the ages of two and eight years is the period of greatest frequency.Though rarer during the later years of childhood, the older the child
the more rapid its progress to a fatal termination.Nursing infants are
not exempt, but those nursed by healthy mothers are much less liable
than the wet-nursed.Among hand-fed infants it is not an uncommon
disease, but it is much more common among the farmed-out children.While, as has been stated, the greatest number of cases occur in those
between two and eight years of age, statistics show that the liability
to it increases from the age of two and a half years up to the eighth,
and, according to some authors, up to the tenth year.At the latter age
there is a remarkable diminution in the number of cases.This fact is
probably due to the greater prevalence of the acute diseases of the
respiratory organs and of the exanthematous diseases among children
during this period of life.Some have attributed it to the more rapid
development and increased functional activity of the mesenteric glands.This circumstance might afford a plausible explanation for the apparent
sudden increase in frequency after the completion of the second year
because of the independent subsistence of children at that age, and the
additional duties imposed upon the alimentary tract and its
dependencies; still, if this were so, the period of greatest frequency
ought to begin at an earlier age and more nearly correspond with the
time of weaning.It is, however, a fact that tubercularization of the
mesenteric glands is more frequently associated with chronic intestinal
inflammation in those over one year than in those under that age.This
fact, together with the greater liability of artificially-fed infants,
would seem to connect, at least in such cases, its secondary origin
with some primary irritation of the intestinal canal.Authors are not yet agreed in regard to the relative frequency of this
disease in boys and girls, though opinions predominate in favor of the
greater number among the males.The statistics of Rilliet and Barthez
and Schmalz show a decidedly greater prevalence among boys.The comparative frequency of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands
cannot be determined.Louis found disease of the mesenteric glands in
one-fourth of the autopsies of persons dying of phthisis; in 100 adults
dying of the same disease Lombard found tuberculosis of these glands in
10; and in the bodies of 100 tuberculous children he found the glands
tuberculous in 34 cases.In the Hopital des Enfants Maladies tubercles
were found in the mesentery of one-half of the children dying of {1185}
tuberculous affections.In the bodies of children dying of tuberculous
disease in the Children's Hospital of Washington tuberculous
degeneration of the mesenteric glands has been found in two-thirds of
the cases, and without a single exception in those dying of rickets.Authors differ also, and the statistics are equally unreliable, in
regard to the relative frequency of tubercularization of the bronchial
and mesenteric glands.The general opinion seems to be in favor of the
greater frequency in the bronchial glands.In a majority of cases both
sets of glands are found diseased.The geographical distribution of tabes mesenterica is as universal as
that of scrofula and pulmonary phthisis.No country or climate is
exempt, yet there is no locality in which it is endemic.It has been
observed among all civilized nations, in the cold regions as well as in
the tropical countries.Wherever scrofulous and phthisical diseases are
known, there also are found cases of tabes mesenterica.Livingstone has
stated that scrofula is unknown in some regions in Central Africa, and
other travellers have made similar statements in regard to some Indian
tribes.The statistics of the Children's Hospital of Washington show a
far greater frequency among the African race than among the whites.It
belongs to no class or condition of life, but occurs more frequently
among the children of the squalid than among the children of the
affluent and well-to-do.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--Modern as well as the older authors
have very generally accepted the conclusion that a constitutional
tendency or liability to this disease is its most frequent and
potential etiological factor.This predisposition may be either
inherited or acquired.The ancients called it the strumous, and the
more recent writers the scrofulous or tuberculous, diathesis.Lugol
maintained that this diathesis is begotten of old and syphilitic
fathers, and others state that children of parents nearly related and
of those broken down by disease and excesses may inherit it.That it is
transmitted by scrofulous and phthisical parents no one can doubt, but
as yet it cannot be defined to be anything more than a peculiarity of
the constitution which may exhibit abnormal reactions against
irritating influences.The scrofulous habit is believed to be indicated
by physical appearances which represent two extremes.The erethic form
is characterized by a feeble and delicate frame; deficient muscular
development; transparent, smooth, and florid skin; light hair and blue
eyes, large pupils; precocious intellect and sanguine temperament; the
torpid form, by a large head; large and tumid upper lip; soft and
flaccid flesh, bloated appearance; short and thick neck; muscular
incapacity, tumid abdomen, and sluggish intellect.Some of these
features are more frequently symptoms of the actual disease than of the
existence of a predisposition to it, and, except so far as they may
refer to a primary scrofulous or pulmonary disease, cannot be accepted
as indicative of the presence of a constitutional tendency to
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.A tumid abdomen, rapid
emaciation, and anaemia are far more valuable signs of the disease of
these glands.Bad air and bad food are also important predisposing causes.They are
conditions to which the children of the poor, especially in large
cities, are constantly exposed.Insufficient protection from climatic
influences, neglect of person, and unhygienic surroundings must be
classed in the same category.It is claimed that vitiated air,
unwholesome habitation, {1186} insufficient or improper food, squalor
and filth may cause the constitutional tendency, as they will certainly
precipitate the development of the disease in those predisposed to it.Exciting Causes.--The border-line between the predisposing and exciting
causes cannot be positively fixed.The presence of tuberculosis or of
some form of scrofulous disease in some other part of the body so
constantly precedes the development of tuberculosis of the mesenteric
glands, even in those who have not exhibited the characteristic
phenomena of the scrofulous diathesis, that such affections must be
regarded as exciting as well as predisposing causes.No one can doubt
the frequent infection of the mesenteric glands in cases of pulmonary
tuberculosis.The probability of systemic infection from a single focus
is universally admitted.These facts and circumstances do not exclude
the possibility of localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.Whether such exclusively local development of tubercles ever occurs
independent of the scrofulous diathesis cannot be determined, but that
the disease does find its exciting cause in inflammatory conditions of
the intestinal mucous membrane cannot be doubted.Schuppel, who asserts
the primary development of the tubercle-formation in lymphatic glands,
does not claim an idiopathic origin, but admits the necessity of a
primary peripheral irritation in direct connection with the affected
gland.The intimate connection between diseases of the intestinal
mucous membrane and of the mesenteric glands is established beyond a
doubt.Vogel and Steiner assert that tabes mesenterica is a common
result of enteritis folliculosa.A primary inflammatory process may not
contain any element which could be classed as tubercle, yet it may
excite secondary tuberculosis of the glands.Whether such a result only
occurs in those who may have acquired or inherited the predisposition
is yet undecided.In many of the cases of tabes mesenterica tuberculous
ulcers are found in the intestines, but it cannot be claimed that such
ulcers are always the primary foci of tuberculous development.If
primary, it is not difficult to understand how the virus may be
transmitted to the glands.It has been claimed that certain articles of food will produce the
disease.Potatoes and rye bread in large quantities and a coarse
vegetable diet have been mentioned among the exciting causes.Deficiency in the quantity of food is a much more frequent cause than
inferiority in quality, yet there can be no doubt that any and every
article of diet that will set up catarrhal inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane may become a cause.Irritation of the mucous
membrane of the alimentary tract, induced by coarse, stimulating, or
imperfectly-digested food, or by the improper and frequent use of
purgative medicines, may give rise to disease of the glands; and, even
though the irritation may in itself be trivial, its long continuance or
frequent renewal may prove sufficient, especially in those in whom the
predisposition is present.Malarial and exanthematous diseases have
also been considered exciting causes, and among the latter class
measles and scarlet fever, because of the inflamed condition of the
intestinal mucous membrane which they leave, are the most frequent.Difficult dentition and whooping cough must also be classed in this
category.Recently attention has been called to the probable transmission of the
disease through the milk of diseased cows, but further investigation
and {1187} more reliable data are necessary to establish this
connection.Klebs has deduced the conclusion from recent experiments
that the use of the milk of cows in advanced phthisis will always
produce tuberculosis, which begins as an intestinal catarrh and extends
to the mesenteric glands.Some of the older authors believed that the cure of some chronic
diseases of the skin and mucous membranes and the suppression of
chronic discharges might induce tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands;
but these conditions are now known to be most frequently the initial
manifestations of the scrofulous diathesis, and the mesenteric
complications are far more likely to occur when these primary foci are
neglected and the patient is left to suffer the unabated progress of
the disease.MORBID ANATOMY.--It is not usual to find all the glands of the
mesentery affected at once, nor of those affected all in the same stage
of disease.Newly-affected glands may be found alongside of others in
an advanced condition.In the first stage the glands are enlarged, but
rarely exceeding the size of a filbert; they are firm, but not
inelastic.This change consists in hyperplasia of the
gland-constituents.Microscopic examination shows abundant
cell-proliferation, but the cells are badly constructed and prone to
undergo retrogressive metamorphosis.The cells accumulate in clusters
without any intercellular substance, and compress the lymph-sinuses and
blood-vessels.The second stage is characterized by the commencement of the cheesy
degeneration.The glands enlarge and coalesce in clusters, sometimes
forming large masses of hardened and inelastic glands.On section they
exhibit in the beginning foci of cheesy material imbedded in the
gland-parenchyma.In the further progress of the change the whole gland
is transformed into a homogeneous yellowish substance.In this
condition there are found on microscopic examination globular
corpuscles, nuclei, shrivelled cells, sometimes giant-cells, and most
frequently tubercles.The tubercles are usually found in the follicular
substance.Birch-Hirschfield says the cheesy formations in secondary
tuberculous mesenteric glands are only found in discrete foci, and the
tubercles occur in the follicular substance imbedded in relatively
normal tissue.The cheesy transformation is, according to Virchow, a
necrobiosis of the hyperplastic gland-elements, but Schuppel insists
that it is the result of tubercular development.After a time the
cheesy masses soften, and the glands are converted into sacs containing
a purulent fluid mixed with debris.In this condition they are most
frequently coalesced in bunches, sometimes forming large tumors.The
intervening walls may break down and the whole bunch be transformed
into one large sac filled with purulent fluid and debris.Occasionally
these masses of agglutinated glands become adherent to the abdominal
parietes or to the intestines.Rupture of their walls may occur, and
the contents may be emptied into either the peritoneal cavity or the
intestines.When communication with the intestines takes place, it is
usually through an ulcer on the mucous surface.It is probable that the
cheesy substance may sometimes be absorbed, as Virchow thinks, by
gradual softening proceeding from the surface toward the centre.It is believed that these degenerated glands sometimes undergo the
cretaceous transformation.Such an instance has been reported by
Carswell: "The patient, who when a child had been affected with tabes
{1188} mesenterica and also with swellings of the cervical glands, some
of which ulcerated, died at the age of twenty-one years of inflammation
of the uterus seven days after delivery.Several of the mesenteric
glands contained a dry cheesy matter mixed with a chalky-looking
substance; others were composed of a cretaceous substance; and a tumor
as large as a hen's egg, included within the folds of the peritoneum,
and which appeared to be the remains of a large agglomerated mass of
glands, was filled with a substance resembling a mixture of putty and
dried mortar, moistened with a small quantity of serosity.In the neck,
and immediately behind an old cicatrix in the skin, there were two
glands containing, in several points of their substance, small masses
of hard cretaceous matter."Calcareous concretions have been observed
by Andral and others in the mesenteric glands in cases of chronic
pulmonary disease; and Soemmering records several observations of a
tartar-like substance found in devastated mesenteric glands in cases of
rickets.The morbid appearances in tabes mesenterica are not usually confined to
the changes in the glands.In very many cases the evidences of disease
of the peripheral glands are quite manifest, and in much the larger
number of cases pulmonary phthisis and disease of the bronchial glands
are present.These
consecutive morbid changes are succinctly set forth in the following
notes of an autopsy taken from the records of the Children's Hospital
of Washington, D.C.The subject was a <DW64> boy aged ten, who had been
taken sick a year previous to his death with a bad cold and cough,
followed several months afterward by enlargement and suppuration of the
cervical glands on both sides: "The body was greatly emaciated, the
lips and teeth covered with sordes.Cheesy masses were scattered
throughout the substance of both lungs.The right lung was firmly
adherent to the thoracic walls, the left adherent at apex.The liver
was enlarged and adherent to all adjacent tissues, and contained many
cheesy nodules scattered throughout its substance and over the surface.The gall-bladder was distended with bile.The spleen was normal in
size, very dark, and filled with cheesy masses.The pancreas contained
many similar masses.The peritoneal cavity contained a quantity of
muddy fluid.The peritoneum was dark in color, studded with tubercles,
and ulcerated in a few places.The stomach and intestines were
distended with gas; the walls of stomach thickened, the inner surface
covered with a shiny mucus; in its lower wall was one large ulcer,
penetrating to the peritoneal coat and measuring three-fourths of an
inch in diameter.The peritoneal coat was thickly studded with nodules
resembling tubercles.The small intestines were gangrenous in a few
places; on the inner surface were found fourteen ulcers, varying in
size from one-fourth to one and one-fourth inches in diameter, with
elevated edges and red bases; two penetrated the peritoneal coat.On the mucous surface of the large
intestines there were seven large ulcers, similar in appearance to
those found in the small intestines.Some of Peyer's patches were
ulcerated.The mesenteric glands, some as large as walnuts, were filled
with cheesy material, and the mesentery was dotted over with small
masses of similar matter."In two of the reported cases of chylous effusion into the peritoneal
cavity the rupture of the lacteals was caused by degeneration of the
{1189} mesenteric glands; and in several other cases the rupture was
produced by the presence of tumors, apparently formed by the
agglomeration of numerous degenerated glands.Several cases of fatty diarrhoea from mesenteric phthisis have been
reported.Of these the most conclusive is the case of Hall.[1] The
clinical history of the case and the detection of enlarged mesenteric
glands in the umbilical and hypogastric regions placed the diagnosis
beyond a doubt.It was, however, verified by the discovery of several
vomicae in the lungs, and of mesenteric glands "universally enlarged
and affected with strumous disease.The intestinal mucous membrane was
dotted with patches of ulceration, with here and there prominent masses
of strumous deposit on the surface."[Footnote 1: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, vol.i., 3d Series, 1855, p.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--It is not possible to describe a definite and uniform
clinical history of this disease.As a secondary complication of
pulmonary phthisis and scrofulous affections the preliminary symptoms
are so constantly identified with the development and progress of these
maladies that, as a rule, the initial stage cannot be recognized by any
special assemblage of symptoms.In any tuberculous or scrofulous child
the possible implication of the mesenteric glands may be predicated
upon any array of symptoms that would establish the presence of these
classes of disease.And even in the absence of the rational and direct
signs of such affections, in those exhibiting the physical evidences of
the strumous diathesis, more especially when it is inherited, the
symptoms of any trivial departure from health, such as the catching of
cold, irritation of the alimentary tract, or protracted convalescence
from any of the exanthematous or intestinal diseases, may constitute
the initial history of tabes mesenterica.In such subjects debility and
anaemia, from whatsoever cause they may apparently result--and, in
fact, any manifest lowering of the standard of health, whether gradual
or precipitate, and without assignable cause--may mark the beginning of
the process of change in the parenchyma of the glands that will
terminate in tuberculosis.The later as well as the earlier history may
be completely masked by the symptomatology of other diseases belonging
to the tuberculous class; and so grave, as a rule, are such primary and
coexisting affections that definite recognition of this complication or
localized extension of the systemic infection becomes more a matter of
skilful diagnosis than of practical utility.But in those cases where disease of the respiratory organs and of the
bronchial glands can be excluded the general symptomatology becomes of
paramount importance.And in view of the value of prophylactic measures
which may be employed to arrest, limit, or delay the localized
tuberculosis of these glands, the precursory symptoms may be of special
significance.This condition may be characterized by languor and
dulness or marked debility and anaemia, with loss of color, attended
with flatulence, stomachal disturbance, frequent eructations consisting
mainly of mucus, a sense of uneasiness in the abdomen after the
ingestion of food, a variable appetite, sometimes voracious and
occasionally depraved.Sometimes a dislike for fatty foods is a
prominent symptom.The tongue may be coated, the breath is usually
foul, and some have said the body emits an acid odor.If these symptoms
occur in a child of the {1190} scrofulous diathesis, or be directly or
remotely associated with a previous gastro-intestinal disease, or occur
or persist during the convalescence of some of the acute affections of
infancy and childhood which stand in etiological relation to this
disease, they may justify a reasonable presumption of commencing change
in the mesenteric glands.This presumption will be strengthened by
emaciation, a more marked disturbance of the digestive function,
attended with fetid and occasionally whitish stools, a tumid belly, and
deep, lancinating abdominal pains of short duration, recurring at long
intervals and neither relieved nor aggravated by pressure or an
evacuation.Some have attributed special importance to a chalky
appearance and loss of consistency of the stools, indicating the
suspension of absorption by the lacteals.There may also be slight
evening fever.Later, the enlargement of the belly increases, the
emaciation becomes more marked and rapid, the appetite more variable,
sometimes very voracious, the alvine discharges more fetid or less
consistent, sometimes putty-like, and generally irregular or
constipated.The febrile exacerbations are more decided, and sometimes
chills may occur at irregular intervals.When, in addition to these
symptoms, either during the earlier or later stages, the enlargement of
the glands can be detected, the clinical picture is complete.In
consequence of the tympanitic distension of the abdomen, which usually
increases with the progress of the disease, it is impossible in a
majority of cases to detect the glandular enlargement; especially is
this true when the affected glands are separate; but, as frequently
happens during the last stage, when large tumors are formed by the
coalescence of a number of diseased glands the diagnosis may be easily
determined.In the absence of the discovery of enlarged glands the
diagnosis cannot be considered positive.They are usually most readily
found in the region of the umbilicus, and may in some cases, even when
the tension of the abdomen is very great, be detected by grasping the
abdomen with the hand and compressing it between the fingers and thumb
so that the enlarged glands will be brought in close contiguity to the
walls and be felt immediately under the fingers.If a tumor should be
present and the peritoneal cavity be free from fluid, its locality may
be recognized by a sense of resistance and circumscribed area of
diminished resonance, and then definitely outlined by palpation.Underwood says: "Indigestion, costiveness or purging, irregular
appetite, flushed cheeks or a total loss of color, impaired strength
and spirits, remitting fever, and a hard and tumid belly, with
emaciated limbs, are amongst the more common symptoms, attending at one
period or other, of this disease."When the diagnosis has been made out, it is not impossible to determine
the stage of the disease.The progressive intensity of the symptoms,
with rapid emaciation as a rule, bears a definite relation to the
progress of the morbid changes taking place in the glands.It must,
however, be borne in mind that children have died of tabes mesenterica
who had enjoyed excellent health up to the moment of death, and the
autopsy disclosed the condition of the glands, which had not been
suspected during life.In the case previously cited, in which the
autopsy exhibited such grave lesions of the stomach, liver, spleen,
pancreas, and intestinal mucous membrane, the clinical phenomena were
at no time commensurate with the gravity of the morbid changes.{1191} DIAGNOSIS.--In the absence of the proof of the presence of
enlarged glands or of a tumor the diagnosis cannot be positively
determined.The enlargement and tympanitic distension of the abdomen do
not necessarily establish the existence of glandular disease, for they
are present in a great many conditions of ill-health in children.Nor
is the coexistence of a tumid belly, emaciation, and fever sufficient,
for they are found in other tuberculous and in gastro-intestinal
diseases.The discovery of enlarged discrete glands by palpation, as
before described, in connection with such disturbances of nutrition as
have been set forth, constitute the strongest presumption in favor of
tabes mesenterica.The presence of enlarged glands unaccompanied by the
ordinary symptoms of the tuberculous or scrofulous processes is
inconclusive, because the glandular hypertrophy may be a simple
hyperplasia, entirely independent of any tendency to retrogressive
metamorphosis.There is usually some tenderness on pressure, but this
may be present in any disease of the abdominal viscera.When the glands
are of sufficient size, they may, by pressure, produce secondary
derangements.Cramps in the legs may be caused by pressure on nerves.Oedema of the legs and dilatation of the superficial abdominal veins
may result from compression of venous trunks."If," says Eustace Smith,
"these veins are seen to ramify on the abdominal surface and to join
the veins on the thoracic walls, tabes may be suspected in the absence
of chronic peritonitis and enlargement of the liver."Ascites may be
present, but is not a necessary result of disease of the glands.When a tumor has been discovered by palpation, it is necessary to
determine its glandular nature.If situated about the umbilicus, in
front of the spinal column, if irregular, hard, and feeling like a
congeries of irregularly-rounded nodules, the evidence is very decided
in favor of its glandular origin.But care must be taken to exclude
tumors formed by fecal accumulations and masses attached to the
omentum.Omental tumors are usually more movable, better defined, more
superficial, and regular in form.Cancerous masses sometimes simulate
glandular tumors.The general history of the case and the age of the
patient are usually sufficient to make a diagnosis by exclusion.Rilliet and Barthez distinguished a cancerous pancreas by the presence
of vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pains.The writer has many times based a conjectural diagnosis--which was
verified by a post-mortem examination--upon the presence of a tumid
abdomen, increasing emaciation, with the history of a protracted
gastro-intestinal catarrh, and an irregular febrile curve characterized
by frequent subnormal temperatures.He has also observed a number of
cases of protracted diarrhoea in children, accompanied with extreme
emaciation, notwithstanding the appetite was good, sometimes even
voracious, and the food taken was ample, nutritious, and easily
digested, in which the stools, varying from two to three, or twice as
many, daily, were whitish, leaden, or slate-, sometimes
semi-fluid, at other times containing lumps or masses of putty
consistence, presenting to the naked eye a greasy appearance and to the
touch a fatty feel, and at the autopsy has found only thinness and
transparency of the coat of the small intestines and degenerated
mesenteric glands.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is decidedly unfavorable.So far as is known
to the writer, there is but one recorded case of recovery in which the
{1192} diagnosis was indisputable and the fact of a cure was
established by an autopsy.This was the case reported by Carswell,
before referred to.The older and some of the modern authors have
claimed many recoveries, but it must be manifest to every student of
pathological anatomy that the mistaken diagnoses must have been nearly
if not quite as numerous as the cases of cure.The writer has not
witnessed a single case of recovery, but he has observed very many
cured cases of disease which exhibited all the subjective and objective
symptoms of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands, save and except
those by which its existence can alone be definitely and positively
established.The case of Carswell demonstrates a remote possibility of
cure by the cretaceous metamorphosis of the degenerated glands in a
subject exhibiting the scrofulous diathesis.In view of this isolated
observation, one cannot refuse to accept a similar possibility in cases
in which the disease may be localized and confined to a few of the
glands.In such cases, if recognized previous to the formation of
cheesy foci, the possibility of staying, limiting, and perhaps
occasionally curing, the disease should not be regarded as absolutely
hopeless; yet the opportunities of examining the glands in the first
stage of change has so rarely occurred that no one is authorized to
assert that the hyperplasia is the true picture of the condition in
which those in the advanced stage had its beginning; nor has any one
claimed to have witnessed the progressive stages of resolution taking
place in such glands.The cretaceous transformation is an accepted though remote possibility,
and absorption by means of gradual softening of the cheesy masses is
perhaps a reasonable hypothesis.But even if either of these processes
was an occasional termination of the disease, it could only lessen its
gravity and prolong life, with an incomplete recovery, in those few
cases in which the tuberculous or scrofulous changes were confined to a
less number of glands than was necessary to maintain the nutrition of
the body.For while there is no serious obstacle to the flow of chyle
through the glands in the condition of simple hyperplasia, it is
completely obstructed in those transformed into cheesy masses or
purulent collections.The channels through the glands must sooner or
later be obliterated by the presence of the abundant cell-proliferation
which characterizes the initial stage of change in this disease.For if
the compression is sufficient to cut off the supply of blood, it must
prove equally destructive to the complex system of lymph-paths.To the
impermeability of the glands must the emaciation and exhaustion which
mark the course of the disease, to a greater or less degree according
to the number of glands involved, be due.If the investigations of Schuppel should be verified, and the primary
tubercle-formations be accepted as the initial stage of change, the
prognosis will be less favorable, but a distinct line of demarcation
may be established between two classes of cases in each of which cheesy
transformation may occur, but in one the tubercle-formations may be
primary, and in the other secondary.In the latter class the prognosis
may be more favorable, because treatment may be effective if commenced
prior to the beginning of the retrogressive metamorphosis.COURSE, DURATION, AND COMPLICATIONS.--When tabes is a complication of
pulmonary or bronchial phthisis, or when either of the latter {1193}
diseases appears as an intercurrent affection during the course of a
primary localized tuberculosis of these glands, the glandular
degeneration runs a more rapid course.When it appears as an extension
of external scrofulous affections or finds its cause in
gastro-intestinal irritation, its course is usually less rapid.The
number of glands involved greatly influences its duration.The
mechanical impediment to nutrition offered by a large number of
impermeable glands promotes rapid emaciation and exhaustion.The
condition of the mucous coat of the alimentary tract offers many
considerations that affect its course and duration.Follicular
enteritis hastens, and tuberculous ulceration of the mucous membrane
speedily brings, the case to a fatal termination.Some of the older authors refer to the frequent complication of rickets
with tabes mesenterica, and the writer in numerous post-mortem
examinations of the bodies of children dying of rickets has invariably
found cheesy mesenteric glands.In view of the fact that rickets is
constantly associated with disturbance of the alimentary tract, it
should not be a surprise to find the glands in such close contiguity
to, and having vascular communication with, the diseased mucous surface
in a condition of hyperplasia.Simple hypertrophy is probably a common
complication in cases which terminate by recovery, but there must be
some element of cause, other than inflammation of the mucous membrane
of the intestines, that determines the retrogressive metamorphosis.Several of the older authors have classed rickets in the category of
strumous diseases, and it may be that in the fatal cases tuberculosis
of the mesenteric glands is a local expression of this diathesis.TREATMENT.--The treatment consists, for the most part, in methods of
prevention and palliation.The tendency to disease of the lymphatic
glands in scrofulous children is so constant that it is important to
remove all sources of irritation and to combat all influences likely to
hasten or promote the localization of the constitutional condition.All
chronic discharges and diseases of the skin and mucous membrane, the
continuance of which might produce glandular complications, should be
cured as speedily as possible, slight colds should receive prompt
attention, and catarrhal inflammations of the respiratory organs should
be arrested as quickly as the resources of science will permit.The
alimentary tract demands constant and careful observation.Trivial
disorders should not be neglected: the causes should be ascertained and
removed.Digestion and nutrition should be maintained at a healthy
standard.The hygiene of person, dwelling, and sleeping apartments
merits constant and intelligent supervision.As stated above, tabes of the mesenteric glands is so frequently
secondary to other diseases of a scrofulous nature that the danger lies
in the failure to arrest or cure such affections.It is unfortunately
too true that some of them are often beyond the resources of medical
skill, but in many cases the initial manifestations of the strumous
diathesis are either entirely neglected or inappropriately treated.In
many such cases the final and fatal complication of mesenteric phthisis
could be prevented.The treatment of these affections belongs properly
to the subjects of tuberculosis and scrofula, to be found in other
parts of this System of Medicine.Localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands is so often, either
{1194} directly or indirectly, connected with catarrhal inflammations
of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane that the cure of these
affections cannot be too strongly insisted upon as an effective method
of prevention.This is especially true with children exhibiting the
physical signs of the strumous diathesis.When it is inherited from a
diseased mother, it may be necessary to resort to artificial feeding
before the proper time for weaning has been reached.In such cases no
uniform rule can be arbitrarily followed.The condition of both mother
and child must be considered, and cases will occur which will demand
the exercise of the most cautious discretion and diligent observation.When the disease has become established but little can be accomplished.In such cases the treatment refers to the palliation of symptoms and
the maintenance of nutrition.Pain, when present, must be relieved--if
necessary by anodynes, either given internally or applied in the form
of cataplasms.Most often it is due to the coexisting disease of the
intestinal mucous membrane or to the ingestion of unsuitable foods.The
diet should be regulated and limited to nutritious and easily-digested
articles.Sometimes, even in cases of advanced degeneration of the
glands, great benefit may be temporarily obtained by attention to the
diet.Diarrhoea should be controlled, but when dependent upon
tuberculous ulcerations of the intestinal mucous membrane but little
can be done toward delaying the fatal termination.When a large number
of glands are affected, it will be necessary to limit the diet to such
nutrient fluids as may be absorbed from the stomach.The medical treatment is confined to a few remedies.Faulty nutrition
is the predominant factor, and the drugs employed should be directed to
the improvement of the assimilative functions.The lacto-phosphate of
iron in the form of syrup, or the phosphates in the form of the
compound syrup, sometimes prove valuable tonics.The lacto-phosphate
may be given in combination with cod-liver oil.This latter, either
internally or by inunction, is the most valuable and universally
applicable of all remedies.The mistake is very frequently made of
giving too large quantities.Few children can digest as much as a
drachm administered three times a day.In Washington it is usually
given in the form of the phosphatic emulsion, and has proved in the
service of the Children's Hospital a valuable and effective remedy in
the nutritional disorders of children.Of the chalybeates, the syrup of
the iodide of iron is by far the most valuable; this may be given alone
or in combination with cod-liver oil.It is specially indicated when
anaemia is a marked characteristic.Some recent reports favor the
employment of pancreatized foods.The ointment of the iodide of lead
has been highly extolled as a local application to the belly.The
nature of the disease should be constantly borne in mind, and all
depressing agencies should be sedulously avoided.{1195}
