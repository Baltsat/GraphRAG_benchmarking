The Forty-Second got the old _cutchery_[51] buildings with
a new thatch roof; and the Seventy-Eighth had the Bareilly College.I omitted to mention in its proper place that on the death of Adrian
Hope, Colonel A. S. Leith-Hay, of the Ninety-Third, succeeded to the
command of the brigade, and Major W. G. A. Middleton got command of the
regiment till we rejoined the Commander-in-Chief, when it was found that
Lieutenant-Colonel Ross, who had exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel C.
Gordon, had arrived from England and taken command before we retook
Bareilly.We remained in Bareilly from May till October in comparative peace.We
had one or two false alarms, and a wing of the Forty-Second, with some
cavalry and artillery, went out about the beginning of June to disperse
a body of rebels who were threatening an attack on Moradabad.These reminiscences do not, as I have before remarked, profess to be a
history of the Mutiny except in so far as I saw it from the ranks of the
Ninety-Third.But I may correct historical mistakes when I find them,
and in vol.500, of _The Indian Empire_, by R. Montgomery
Martin, the following statement occurs: "Khan Bahadoor Khan, of
Bareilly, held out in the Terai until the close of 1859; and then,
hemmed in by the Goorkhas on one side and the British forces on the
other, was captured by Jung Bahadoor.The Khan is described as an old
man, with a long white beard, bent almost double with rheumatic fever.His life is considered forfeited by his alleged complicity in the
Bareilly murders, but his sentence is not yet pronounced."Khan Bahadoor Khan was captured by the Bareilly
police-levy early in July, 1858, and was hanged in my presence in front
of the _kotwalee_ in Bareilly a few days after his capture.He was an
old man with a long white beard, but not at all bent with age, and there
was certainly no want of proof of his complicity in the Bareilly
murders.Next to the Nana Sahib he was one of the most active
instigators of murder in the rebel ranks.He was a retired judge of the
Company's service, claiming descent from the ancient rulers of
Rohilcund, whom the English, in the time of Warren Hastings, had
assisted the Nawab of Lucknow to put down in the Rohilla war.His
capture was effected in the following manner:--Colonel W. C. M'Donald,
of the Ninety-Third, was on the staff in the Crimea, and he had in his
employ a man named Tahir Beg who was a sort of confidential interpreter.Whether this man was Turkish, Armenian, or Bulgarian I don't know, but
this much I do know; among Mahommedans Tahir Beg was a strict Mussulman,
among Bulgarians he was a Roman Catholic, and in the Ninety-Third he had
no objections to be a Presbyterian.He was a good linguist, speaking
English, French, and Turkish, as well as most of the vernaculars of Asia
Minor; and when the Crimean war was over, he accompanied Major M'Donald
to England in the capacity of an ordinary servant.In 1857, when the
expedition under Lord Elgin was being got ready for China, Colonel
M'Donald was appointed quarter-master-general, and started for Canton
taking Tahir Beg with him as a servant; but, the expedition to China
having been diverted for the suppression of the Mutiny, M'Donald
rejoined the regiment with Tahir Beg still with him in the same
capacity.From his knowledge of Turkish and Persian Tahir Beg soon made
himself master of Hindoostanee, and he lived in the regimental bazaar
with the Mahommedan shopkeepers, among whom he professed himself a
strict follower of the Prophet.After he became pretty well conversant
with the language, it was reported that he gained much valuable
information for the authorities.When Bareilly was recaptured
arrangements were made for the enlistment of a police-levy, and Tahir
Beg got the appointment of city _kotwal_[52] and did valuable service by
hunting out a great number of leading rebels.It was Tahir Beg who heard
that Khan Bahadoor Khan had returned to the vicinity of Bareilly with
only a small body of followers; and he arranged for his capture, and
brought him in a prisoner to the guard-room of the Ninety-Third.Khan
Bahadoor Khan was put through a brief form of trial by the civil power,
and was found guilty of rebellion and murder upon both native and
European evidence.By that time several Europeans who had managed to
escape to Naini Tal on the outbreak of the Mutiny through the favour of
the late Raja of Rampore, had returned; so there was no doubt of the
prisoner's guilt.I must mention another incident that happened in Bareilly.Among the
gentlemen who returned from Naini Tal, was one whose brother had been
shot by his bearer, his most trusted servant.This ruffian turned out to
be no other than the very man who had denounced Jamie Green as a spy.It
was either early in August or at the end of July that a strange European
gentleman, while passing through the regimental bazaar of the
Ninety-Third, noticed an officer's servant, who was a most devout
Christian, could speak English, and was a regular attendant at all
soldiers' evening services with the regimental chaplain.The gentleman
(I now forget his name) laid hold of our devout Christian brother in the
bazaar, and made him over to the nearest European guard, when he was
tried and found guilty of the murder of a whole family of
Europeans--husband, wife, and children--in May, 1857.There was no want
of evidence, both European and native, against him.Thus was the death
of the unfortunate Jamie Green avenged.I may add a rather amusing
incident about this man.His master evidently believed that this was a
case of mistaken identity, and went to see the brigadier, Colonel A. S.
Leith-Hay, on behalf of his servant.But it turned out that the man had
joined the British camp at Futtehghur in the preceding January, and
Colonel Leith-Hay was the first with whom he had taken service and
consequently knew the fellow.However, the brigadier listened to what
the accused's master had to urge until he mentioned that the man was a
most devout Christian, and read the Bible morning and evening.On this
Colonel Leith-Hay could listen to the argument no longer, but shouted
out:--"He a Christian!He's no more a
Christian than I am!He served me for one month, and robbed me of more
than ten times his pay.So he was made over to the
civil commissioner, tried, found guilty, and hanged.About the end of September the
weather was comparatively cool.Many people had returned from Naini Tal
to look after their wrecked property.General Colin Troup with the
Sixty-Sixth Regiment of Goorkhas had come down from Kumaon, and
soldiers' sports were got up for the amusement of the troops and
visitors.Among the latter was the loyal Raja of Rampore, who presented
a thousand rupees for prizes for the games and five thousand for a
dinner to all the troops in the garrison.At these games the
Ninety-Third carried off all the first prizes for putting the shot,
throwing the hammer, and tossing the caber.Our best athlete was a man
named George Bell, of the grenadier company, the most powerful man in
the British army.Before the regiment left England Bell had beaten all
comers at all the athletic games throughout Scotland.He stood about six
feet four inches, and was built in proportion, most remarkably active
for his size both in running and leaping, and also renowned for feats of
strength.There was a young lad of the band named Murdoch MacKay, the
smallest boy in the regiment, but a splendid dancer; and the two, "the
giant and the pigmy," as they were called, attended all the athletic
games throughout Scotland from Edinburgh to Inverness, always returning
covered with medals.I mention all this because the Bareilly sports
proved the last to poor George Bell.An enormous caber having been cut,
and all the leading men (among them some very powerful artillerymen) of
the brigade had tried to toss it and failed.The brigadier then ordered
three feet to be cut from it, expressing his opinion that there was not
a man in the British army who could toss it.On this George Bell stepped
into the arena, and said he would take a turn at it before it was cut;
he put the huge caber on his shoulders, balanced it, and tossed it clean
over.While the caber was being cut for the others, Bell ran in a
hundred yards' race, which he also won; but he came in with his mouth
full of blood.He had, through over-exertion, burst a blood-vessel in
his lungs.He slowly bled to death and died about a fortnight after we
left Bareilly, and lies buried under a large tree in the jungles of Oude
between Fort Mithowlie and the banks of the Gogra.Bell was considered
an ornament to, and the pride of, the regiment, and his death was
mourned by every officer and man in it, and by none more than by our
popular doctor, Billy Munro, who did everything that a physician could
do to try and stop the bleeding; but without success.We left Bareilly on the 10th of October, and marched to Shahjehanpore,
where we were joined by a battalion of the Sixtieth Rifles, the
Sixty-Sixth Goorkhas, some of the Sixth Carabineers, Tomb's troop of
horse-artillery, and a small train of heavy guns and mortars.On the
17th of October we had our first brush with the enemy at the village of
Posgaon, about twenty miles from Shahjehanpore.Here they were strong in
cavalry, and tried the Bareilly game of getting round the flanks and
cutting up our camp-followers.But a number of them got hemmed in
between the ammunition-guard and the main line, and Cureton's Mooltanee
cavalry, coming round on them from both flanks, cut down about fifty of
them, capturing their horses.In the midst of this scrimmage two of the
enemy, getting among the baggage-guard, were taken for two of our native
cavalry, till at length they separated from the main body and got
alongside of a man who was some distance away.One of them called to the
poor fellow to look in another direction, when the second one cut his
head clean off, leaped from his horse, and, lifting the head, sprang
into his saddle and was off like the wind!Many rifle-bullets were sent
after him, but he got clear away, carrying the head with him.The next encounter we had was at Russoolpore, and then at Nowrungabad,
where the Queen's proclamation, transferring the government from the
Company to the Crown, was read.After this all our tents were sent into
Mahomdee, and we took to the jungles without tents or baggage, merely a
greatcoat and a blanket; and thus we remained till after the taking of
Mithowlie.We then returned to Sitapore, where we got our tents again
the day before Christmas, 1858; and by the new year we were on the banks
of the Gogra, miles from any village.The river swarmed with alligators
of enormous size, and the jungles with wild pig and every variety of
game, and scarcely a day passed without our seeing tigers, wolves, and
hyaenas.We remained in those jungles
across the Gogra, in sight of the Nepaul hills, till about the end of
February, by which time thousands of the rebels had tendered their
submission and returned to their homes.The Ninety-Third then got the
route for Subathoo, in the Himalayas near Simla.Leaving the jungles of
Oude, we marched _via_ Shahjehanpore, Bareilly, Moradabad, and thence by
the foot of the hills till we came into civilised regions at
Saharunpore; thence to Umballa, reaching Subathoo about the middle of
April with our clothes completely in rags.We had received no new
clothing since we had arrived in India, and our kilts were torn into
ribbons.But the men were in splendid condition, and could have marched
thirty miles a day without feeling fatigued, if our baggage-animals
could have kept up with us.On our march out from Kalka, the
Commander-in-Chief passed us on his way to Simla.This ended the work of the old Ninety-Third Sutherland Highlanders in
the Mutiny, and here, for the present, I will end my reminiscences.FOOTNOTES:

THE HISTORY OF THE MURDER OF MAJOR NEILL AT AUGUR IN 1887


I will relate an incident of an unusual kind, told to me by a man whom I
met in Jhansi, which has reference to the executions ordered by General
Neill at Cawnpore in July and August, 1857.But before I do so I may
mention that in Cawnpore, Jhansi, and Lucknow I found the natives very
unwilling to enter into conversation or to give any information about
the events of that year.In this statement I don't include the natives
of the class who acted as guides, etc., or those who were in the service
of Government at the time._They_ were ready enough to talk; but as a
rule I knew as much myself as they could tell me.Those whom I found
suspicious of my motives and unwilling to talk, were men who must have
been on the side of the rebels against us.I looked out for such, and
met many who had evidently served as soldiers, and who admitted that
they had been in the army before 1857; but when I tried to get them to
speak about the Mutiny, as a rule they pretended to have been so young
that they had forgotten all about it,--generally a palpable falsehood,
judging from their personal appearance,--or they professed to have been
absent in their villages and to know nothing about the events happening
in the great centres of the rebellion.The impression left on my mind
was that they were either afraid or ashamed to talk about the Mutiny.In the second chapter of these reminiscences it may be remembered I
asked if any reader could let me know whether Major A. H. S. Neill,
commanding the Second Regiment Central India Horse, who was shot on
parade by Sowar Mazar Ali at Augur, Central India, on the 14th March,
1887, was a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame.The information has
not been forthcoming[53]; and for want of it I cannot corroborate the
following statement in a very strange story.In 1892 I passed two days at Jhansi, having been obliged to wait because
the gentleman whom I had gone to see on business was absent from the
station; and I went all over the city to try and pick up information
regarding the Mutiny.I eventually came across a man who, by his
military salute, I could see had served in the army, and I entered into
conversation with him.At first he pretended that his connection with the army had merely been
that of an armourer-_mistree_[54] of several European regiments; and he
told me that he had served in the armourer's shop of the Ninety-Third
when they were in Jhansi twenty-four years ago, in 1868 and 1869.After
I had informed him that the Ninety-Third was my regiment, he appeared to
be less reticent; and at length he admitted that he had been an armourer
in the service of Scindia before the Mutiny, and that he was in Cawnpore
when the Mutiny broke out, and also when the city was retaken by
Generals Havelock and Neill.After a long conversation he appeared to be convinced that I had no evil
intentions, but was merely anxious to collect reliable evidence
regarding events which, even now, are but slightly known.Amongst other
matters he told me that the (late) Maharaja Scindia was not by any means
so loyal as the Government believed him to be; that he himself (my
informant) had formed one of a deputation that was sent to Cawnpore from
Gwalior to the Nana Sahib before the outbreak; and that although keeping
in the background, the Maharaja Scindia incited his army to rebellion
and to murder their officers, and himself fled as a pretended fugitive
to Agra to devise means to betray the fort of Agra, should the Gwalior
army, as he anticipated would be the case, prove victorious over the
British.He also told me that the farce played by Scindia about 1874,
viz.the giving up a spurious Nana Sahib, was a prearranged affair
between Scindia and the _fakeer_ who represented the Nana.But, as I
expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, my friend came down to
more recent times, and asked me if I remembered about the murder of
Major Neill at Augur in Central India in 1887, thirty years after the
Mutiny?I told him that I very well remembered reading of the case in
the newspapers of the time.He then asked me if I knew why Major Neill
was murdered?I replied that the published accounts of the murder and
trial were so brief that I had formed the conclusion that something was
concealed from the public, and that I myself was of opinion that a woman
must have been the cause of the murder,--that Major Neill possibly had
been found in some intrigue with one of Mazar Ali's womenkind.To which
he replied that I was quite wrong.He then told me that Major Neill was
a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame, and that Sowar Mazar Ali, who
shot him, was a son of Suffur Ali, _duffadar_ of the Second Regiment
Light Cavalry, who was unjustly accused of having murdered Sir Hugh
Wheeler at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_, and was hanged for the murder by
order of General Neill, after having been flogged by sweepers and made
to lick clean a portion of the blood-stained floor of the
slaughter-house.After the recapture of Cawnpore, Suffur Ali was arrested in the city,
and accused of having cut off General Wheeler's head as he alighted from
his palkee at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_ on the 27th of June, 1857.This
he stoutly denied, pleading that he was a loyal servant of the Company
who had been compelled to join in the Mutiny against his will.General
Neill, however, would not believe him, so he was taken to the
slaughter-house and flogged by Major Bruce's sweeper-police till he
cleaned up his spot of blood from the floor of the house where the women
and children were murdered.When about to be hanged Suffur Ali adjured
every Mahommedan in the crowd to have a message sent to Rohtuck, to his
infant son, by name Mazar Ali, to inform him that his father had been
unjustly denied and flogged by sweepers by order of General Neill before
being hanged, and that his dying message to him was that he prayed God
and the Prophet to spare him and strengthen his arm to avenge the death
of his father on General Neill or any of his descendants.My informant went on to tell me that Mazar Ali had served under Major
Neill for years, and had been treated by him with special kindness
before he came to know that the Major was the son of the man who had
ordered his father's execution; that while he was lying ill in hospital
a _fakeer_ one day arrived in the station from some remote quarter of
India, and told him of his father's dying imprecation, and that Major
Neill being the son of General Neill, it was the decree of fate that
Mazar Ali should shoot Major Neill on parade the following day; which he
did, without any apparent motive whatever.I expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, when my informant
told me he could give me a copy of a circular, printed in Oordoo and
English, given to the descendants of Suffur Ali, directing them, as a
message from the other world, to avenge the death and defilement of
their father.The man eventually brought the leaflet to me in the _dak_
bungalow in Jhansi.The circular is in both Oordoo and English, and
printed in clean, clear type; but so far as I can read it, the English
translation, which is printed on the leaflet beneath the Oordoo, and a
copy of which I reproduce below, does not strike me as a literal
translation of the Oordoo.The latter seems to me to be couched in
language calculated to prove a much stronger incitement to murder than
the English version would imply.However, the following is the English
version _verbatim_, as it appears on the leaflet, word for word and
point for point, italics and all._The imprecation, vociferated by_ SUFFUR ALI,
      _Duffadar 2nd Regiment Light Cavalry, who was executed at
      the Slaughter-house, on the 25th July, 1857, for killing_
      SIR HUGH WHEELER, _at the Suttechoura Ghat_.be pleased to receive into Paradise the
      soul of your humble servant, whose body Major Bruce's Mehtur
      police are now defiling by lashes, forced to lick a space of
      the blood-stained floor of the Slaughter-house, and
      hereafter to be hanged, by the order of General Neill.And,
      oh Prophet!in due time inspire my infant son Mazar Ali of
      Rohtuck, that he may revenge this desecration on the General
      and his descendants._Take notice!_--Mazar Ali, Sowar, 2nd Regiment, Central
      India Horse, who under divine mission, shot Major A. H. S.
      Neill, Commanding the Corps, at Augur, Central India, on the
      14th March 1887, was sentenced to death by Sir Lepel
      Griffin, Governor-General's Agent.The Oordoo in the circular is printed in the Persian character without
the vowel-points, and as I have not read much Oordoo since I passed my
Hindoostanee examination thirty-three years ago, I have had some
difficulty in translating the leaflet, especially as it is without the
vowel-points.The man who gave it to me asked if I knew anything about
the family of General Neill, and I replied that I did not, which was the
truth.When I asked why he wanted to know, he said that if any more of
his sons were still in India, their lives would soon be taken by the
descendants of men who were defiled and hanged at Cawnpore under the
brigade-order of General Neill, dated Cawnpore, 25th of July, 1857.This
is the order to which I have alluded in the second chapter of my
reminiscences, and which remained in force till the arrival of Sir Colin
Campbell at Cawnpore in the following November.As I had never seen a
copy of it, having only heard of it, I asked my informant how he knew
about it.He told me that thousands of copies, in English, Oordoo, and
Hindee, were in circulation in the bazaars of Upper India.I told my
friend that I should very much like to see a copy, and he promised to
bring me one.Shortly after he left me in the _dak_ bungalow,
undertaking to return with a copy of the order, as also numerous
proclamations from the English Government, and the counter-proclamations
on the part of the leaders of the rebellion.I thought that here I had
struck a rich historical mine; but my friend did not turn up again!I
sat up waiting for him till long after midnight, and as he did not
return I went into the city again the following day to the place where I
had met him; but all the people around pretended to know nothing
whatever about the man, and I saw no more of him.However, I was glad to
have got the leaflet _re_ the assassination of Major Neill, because
several gentlemen have remarked, since I commenced my reminiscences,
that I mention so many incidents not generally known, that many are
inclined to believe that I am inventing history rather than relating
facts.But that is not so; and, besides what I have related, I could
give hundreds of most interesting incidents that are not generally known
nor ever will be known.[55]

Now, in my humble opinion, is the time that a history of the real facts
and causes of the Mutiny should be written, if a competent man could
devote the time to do so, and to visit the centres of the rebellion and
get those who took part in the great uprising against the rule of the
Feringhee to come forward, with full confidence of safety, and relate
all they know about the affair.Thousands of facts would come to light
which would be of immense historical importance, as also of great
political value to Government, facts that in a few years will become
lost to the world, or be remembered only as traditions of 1857.But the
man who is to undertake the work must be one with a thorough knowledge
of the native character and languages, a man of broad views, and, above
all, one who would, to a certain extent, sympathise with the natives,
and inspire them with confidence and enlist their assistance.As a rule,
the Englishman, the Government official, the _Sahib Bahadoor_, although
respected, is at the same time too much feared, and the truth would be
more or less concealed from him.I formed this opinion when I heard of
the circumstances which are supposed to have led to the assassination of
Major Neill.If true, we have here secret incitement to murder handed
down for generations, and our Government, with its extensive police and
its Thuggee Department, knowing nothing about it![56]

FOOTNOTES:

[53] Major Neill _was_ a son of Brigadier-General Neill commanding at
Cawnpore during the first relief of Lucknow.General Neill went to the
front as colonel commanding the First Madras Fusiliers.[54] Workman; in this case a blacksmith.[55] "Some of the incidents related by Mr.Forbes-Mitchell, and now for
the first time brought to light in his most interesting series of
Reminiscences, are of so sensational an order that we are not surprised
that many persons to whom the narrator is a stranger should regard them
with a certain incredulity.We may take this opportunity therefore of
stating that, so far as it is possible at this date to corroborate
incidents that occurred thirty-five years ago, Mr.Forbes-Mitchell has
afforded us ample proof of the accuracy of his memory and the general
correctness of his facts.In the case under notice, we have been shown
the leaflet in which Mazar Ali's cold-blooded murder of his commanding
officer is vindicated, and of which the English translation above given
is an exact reproduction.The leaflet bears no evidence whatever to
disclose its origin, but we see no reason to doubt that, as Mr.Forbes-Mitchell's informant declared, it was widely circulated in the
bazaars of Upper India shortly after Mazar Ali paid the penalty of his
crime with his own life."--ED._Calcutta Statesman._

[56] The _vendetta_ is such a well-known institution among the Pathans,
that no further explanation of Major Neill's murder by the son of a man
who was executed by the Major's father's orders is necessary.APPENDIX B

EUROPEANS AMONG THE REBELS


Although recollections of the Mutiny are fast being obliterated by the
kindly hand of time, there must still be many readers who will remember
the reports current in the newspapers of the time, and elsewhere in 1857
and 1858, of Europeans being seen in the ranks of the rebels.In a
history of _The Siege of Delhi, by an Officer who served there_ (name
not given), published by Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh, 1861, the
following passages occur.After describing the battle of
Budlee-ke-Serai, the writer goes on to say: "The brave old Afghan chief,
Jan Fishan Khan,[57] who with some horsemen had followed our star from
Meerut, was heard crying out, his stout heart big with the enthusiasm of
the moment: 'Another such day, and I shall become a Christian!'"And in
his comments on this the writer says: "And sad to tell, a European
deserter from Meerut had been struck down fighting in the sepoy ranks,
and was recognised by his former comrades."After describing the opening
of the siege and the general contempt which the Europeans had for the
enemy's artillery, the writer states that the tone of conversation in
the camp was soon changed, and "From being an object of contempt, their
skill became one of wonder and admiration, perhaps too great.Some
artillery officers protested that their practice was better than our
own.Many believed that their fire was under the superintendence of
Europeans.Two men with solar helmets could be seen, by the help of our
best glasses, in their batteries, but no one who knew how much of the
work in India was really done by natives, wondered at the practical
skill they now showed."Turning from Delhi to Lucknow, many will
remember the account of the disastrous action at Chinhut by Mr.He
says: "The masses of the rebel cavalry by which the British were
outflanked near the Kookrail bridge, were apparently commanded by some
European who was seen waving his sword and attempting to make his men
follow him and dash at ours.He was a handsome-looking man, well-built,
fair, about twenty-five years of age, with light moustaches, wearing the
undress uniform of a European cavalry officer, with a blue, gold-laced
cap on his head."Rees suggests the possibility of this person
having been either a Russian or a renegade Christian.The only other case to which I will allude came under my own
observation.I have told in my fourteenth chapter how Brigadier Adrian
Hope was killed in the abortive attack on the fort of Rooyah, by a shot
fired from a high tree inside the fort, and how it was commonly believed
that the man who fired the shot was a European.I myself thought at the
time that such was the case, and now I am convinced of it.I was the
non-commissioned officer of a party of the Ninety-Third sent to cover an
engineer-officer who had either volunteered or been ordered to take a
sketch of one of the fort gates and its approaches, in the hope of being
able to blow it in, and thus gain an entrance to the fort, which was
surrounded by a deep ditch, and inside the ditch an almost impenetrable
belt of prickly bamboos about ten yards in breadth, so interwoven and
full of thorns that a cat could scarcely have passed through it.Under
the guidance of a native of the Intelligence Department, we managed to
advance unseen, and got under cover of a thick clump of bamboos near the
gate.Strict orders had been given that no one on any account whatever
was to speak, much less to fire a shot, unless we should be attacked,
for fear of drawing attention to our proceedings, till the engineer had
had time to make a rough sketch of the position of the gate and its
approaches.During this time we were so close to the fort that we could
hear the enemy talking inside; and the man who was on the tree could be
seen and heard by us quite plainly, calling to the stormers on the other
face in unmistakable barrack-room English: "Come on, you ----
Highlanders!you have a harder nut to crack than eating
oatmeal porridge.If you can come through these bamboos we'll warm your
---- for you, if you come in here!"In short, the person
talking showed such a command of English slang and barrack-room abuse
that it was clear he was no native.Every one of my party was convinced
that the speaker was a European, and if we had been aware at the time
that this man had just killed Brigadier Hope he would certainly have
paid the penalty with his own life; but we knew nothing of this till we
retired, and found that the stormers had been recalled, with the
butcher's bill already given.The events above related had almost passed from my recollection, till
they were recalled by the following circumstance.A vacancy having
occurred among the _durwans_[58] in the factory under my charge, among
several candidates brought by the _jemadar_[59] for the vacant post was
a fine-looking old man, who gave me an unmistakable military salute in
the old style, square from the shoulder--quite different from the
present mongrel German salute, which the English army has taken to
imitating since the Germans beat their old conquerors, the French; I
mean the present mode of saluting with the palm of the hand turned to
the front.As soon as I saw this old man I knew he had been a soldier;
my heart warmed to him at once, and I determined to give him the vacant
appointment.So turning to him I said: "You have served in the army; are
you one of the sepoys of 1857?"He at once admitted that he had formerly
belonged to the Ninth Native Infantry, and that he was present with the
regiment when it mutinied at Allyghur on the 20th of May, 1857.He had
accompanied the regiment to Delhi, and had fought against the English
throughout the siege, and afterwards at Lucknow and throughout the Oude
campaigns."But, _Sahib_" said he, "the Ninth Regiment were almost the
only regiment which did not murder their officers.We gave each of them
three months' pay in advance from the treasury, and escorted them and
their families within a safe distance of Agra before we went to Delhi,
and all of us who lived to come through the Mutiny were pardoned by the
Government."I knew this to be the truth, and ordered the _jemadar_ to
enrol the applicant, by name Doorga, or Doorga Sing, late sepoy of the
Ninth Native Infantry, as one of the factory _durwans_, determining to
have many a talk with him on his experiences of the Mutiny.Many of my readers may recollect that, after escorting their European
officers to the vicinity of Agra, the Ninth Regiment went to Delhi, and
throughout the siege the men of this regiment proved the most daring
opponents of the British Army.According to Mead's _Sepoy Revolt_, "The
dead bodies of men bearing the regimental number of the Ninth Regiment
were found in the front line of every severe engagement around Delhi and
at the deadly Cashmere Gate when it was finally stormed."After engaging
Doorga Sing it was not long before I made him relate his experiences of
the siege of Delhi, and afterwards at Lucknow and in Oude, and one day I
happened to ask him if it was true that there were several Europeans in
the rebel army.He told me that he had heard of several, but that he
personally knew of two only, one of whom accompanied the mutineers from
Meerut and was killed at the battle of Budlee-ke-Serai,--evidently the
deserter alluded to above.The other European was a man of superior
stamp, who came to Delhi from Rohilcund with the Bareilly Brigade, and
the King gave him rank in the rebel army next to General Bukht Khan, the
titular Commander-in-Chief, This European commanded the artillery
throughout the siege of Delhi, as he had formerly been in the Company's
artillery and knew the drill better than any man in the rebel army.I
asked Doorga Sing if he had ever heard his name or what rank he held
before the Mutiny, and he said he had heard his name at the time, but
had forgotten it, and that before the Mutiny he had held the rank of
sergeant-major, but whether in the native artillery or in one of the
native infantry regiments at Bareilly he did not now recollect.But the
Badshah promoted him to be general of artillery immediately on the
arrival of the Bareilly Brigade, and he was by far the bravest and most
energetic commander that the rebels had, and the most esteemed by the
revolted sepoys, whose respect he retained to the last.Even after they
had ceased saluting their native officers they continued to turn out
guards and present arms to the European _sahib_.Throughout the siege of
Delhi there was never a day passed that this man did not visit every
battery, and personally correct the elevation of the guns.He fixed the
sites and superintended the erection of all new batteries to counteract
the fire of the English as the siege advanced.On the day of the
assault, the 14th of September, he fought like _shaitan_,[60] fighting
himself and riding from post to post, trying to rally defeated sepoys,
and bringing up fresh troops to the support of assailed points.Doorga
Sing's company had formed the guard at the Cashmere Gate, and he vividly
described the attack and defence of that post, and how completely the
sepoys were surprised and the powder-bags fixed to the gate before the
sentries of the guard were aware of the advance of the English.After the assault Doorga Sing did not see the European till the beaten
army reached Muttra, when he again found him superintending the
arrangements for crossing the Jumna.About thirty thousand sepoys had
collected there in their retreat from Delhi, a common danger holding
them together, under the command of Bukht Khan and Feroze Shah.But they
paid more respect to the European, and obeyed his orders with far more
alacrity than they did those of Bukht Khan or any other of their nominal
leaders.After crossing the Jumna the European remained with the rebels
till they reached a safe retreat on the Oude side of the Ganges, when he
left the force in company with the Raja of Surajpore, a petty state on
the Oude side about twenty or twenty-five miles above Cawnpore.About
this time my informant, Doorga Sing, having been wounded at Delhi, left
the rebel army _en route_ to Lucknow, and returned to his village near
Onao in Oude; but hearing of the advance of the English, and expecting
no mercy, he and several others repaired to Lucknow, and rejoined their
old comrades.He did not again see the European till after the fall of Lucknow, when
he met him at Fort Rooyah, where he commanded the sepoys, and was the
principal adviser of the Raja Nirput Singh, whom he prevented from
accepting the terms offered by the English through General Walpole.I am
fully convinced that this was the man whom we saw in the tree, and who
was reported to have killed Brigadier Hope.After their retreat from Rooyah the sepoys, under this European,
remained in the jungles till the English army had passed on to Bareilly,
when they reattacked Shahjehanpore, and would have retaken it, if a
brigade had not arrived from Bareilly to its relief.After being driven
back from Shahjehanpore the sepoys held together in Mahomdee, Sitapore,
and elsewhere, throughout the hot season of 1858, mostly under the
guidance of the European and Bukht Khan.The last time Doorga Sing saw
the renegade was after the battle of Nawabgunge in Oude, where Bukht
Khan was killed and a large number of the sepoys were driven across the
Raptee into Nepaul territory, upon which they held a council among
themselves and determined to follow their leaders no longer, but to give
themselves up to the nearest English post under the terms of the Queen's
proclamation.The European tried to dissuade them from doing this,
telling them that if they gave themselves up they would all be hanged
like dogs or sent in chains across the _Kala Pani_.[61] But they had
already suffered too much to be further imposed upon, and one of their
number, who had gone to get information about other parties who were
known to have given themselves up to the English, returned at this time
with information that all sepoys who had not taken part in murdering
their officers were, after giving up their arms, provided with a pass
and paid two rupees each, and allowed to return to their villages.On
this the greater part of the sepoys, including all left alive of the
Ninth Regiment, told the European that they had resolved to listen to
him no longer, but to return to their villages and their families, after
giving themselves up at the nearest English post.Thereupon the _sahib_
sat down and commenced to shed tears, saying _he_ had neither home nor
country to return to.There he was left, with a few more whose crimes
had placed them beyond the hope of pardon; and that was the last which
Doorga Sing saw or heard of the European general of the mutineer
artillery.Before writing this, I have often cross-questioned Doorga Sing about
this European, and his statements never vary.He says that the time is
now so long past that he could not be sure of the _sahib's_ name even if
he heard it; but he is positive he came from Bareilly, and that his rank
before the Mutiny was sergeant-major, and that he had formerly been in
the Company's artillery.He thinks, however, that at the time of the
Mutiny this sergeant was serving with one of the native infantry
regiments in Bareilly; and he further recollects that it was commonly
reported in the sepoy ranks that when the Mutiny broke out this
sergeant-major had advised the murder of all the European officers,
himself shooting the adjutant of the regiment with his own hand to prove
his loyalty to the rebel cause.The whole narrative is so extraordinary that I publish it with a view to
discovering if there are any still living who can give facts bearing on
this strange, but, I am convinced, true story.Doorga Sing promised to
find for me one or two other mutineer sepoys who knew more about this
European and his antecedents than he himself did.I have no detailed
statement of the Mutiny at Bareilly, and the short account which I
possess merely says that, "As soon as the artillery fired the signal gun
in their lines, Brigadier Sibbald mounted his horse and galloped off to
the cavalry lines, but was met on the way by a party of infantry, who
fired on him.He received a bullet in his chest, and then turned his
horse and galloped to the appointed rendezvous for the Europeans, and,
on arriving there, dropped dead from his horse."The account then goes
on to say: "The European sergeant-major had remained in the lines, and
Adjutant Tucker perished while endeavouring to save the life of the
sergeant-major."The question arises--Is it possible that this
sergeant-major can have been the same man whom Doorga Sing afterwards
met in command of the rebel ranks in Delhi, and who was said to have
killed his adjutant?FOOTNOTES:

A FEW WORDS ON SWORD-BLADES


A short time back I read an article on sword-blades, reprinted I believe
from some English paper.Now, in a war like the Mutiny sword-blades are
of the utmost importance to men who depend on them either for taking or
preserving life; I will therefore state my own experience, and give
opinions on the swords which came under my observation, and I may at
once say that I think there is great room for improvement in our blades
of Birmingham manufacture.I consider that the swords supplied to our
officers, cavalry and artillery, are far inferior as weapons of offence
to a really good Oriental _tulwar_.Although an infantry man I saw a
good deal of sword-practice, because all the men who held the
Secundrabagh and the Begum's Kothee were armed with native _tulwars_
from the King of Oude's armoury, in addition to their muskets and
bayonets, and a large proportion of our men were killed and wounded by
sword-cuts.In the first place, then, for cutting our English regulation swords are
too straight; the Eastern curved blade is far more effective as a
cutting weapon.Secondly, our English swords are far too blunt, whereas
the native swords are as keen in edge as a well-stropped razor.Our
steel scabbards again are a mistake for carrying sharp blades; and, in
addition to this, I don't think our mounted branches who are armed with
swords have proper appliances given to them for sharpening their edges.Even in time of peace, but especially in time of war, more attention
ought to be given to this point, and every soldier armed with a sword
ought to be supplied with the means of sharpening it, and made to keep
it with an edge like a razor.I may mention that this fact was noticed
in the wars of the Punjab, notably at Ramnugger, where our English
cavalry with their blunt swords were most unequally matched against the
Sikhs with _tulwars_ so keen of edge that they would split a hair.I remember reading of a regiment of British cavalry charging a regiment
of Sikh cavalry.The latter wore voluminous thick _puggries_ round their
heads, which our blunt swords were powerless to cut through, and each
horseman had also a buffalo-hide shield slung on his back.They
evidently knew that the British swords were blunt and useless, so they
kept their horses still and met the British charge by lying flat on
their horses' necks,[62] with their heads protected by the thick turban
and their backs by the shields; and immediately the British soldiers
passed through their ranks the Sikhs swooped round on them and struck
them back-handed with their sharp, curved swords, in several instances
cutting our cavalry men in two.In one case a British officer, who was
killed in the charge I describe, was hewn in two by a back-handed stroke
which cut right through an ammunition-pouch, cleaving the pistol-bullets
right through the pouch and belt, severing the officer's backbone and
cutting his heart in two from behind.It was the same in the Balaclava
charge, both with the Heavy and the Light Brigade.Their swords were too
straight, and so blunt that they would not cut through the thick coats
and sheep-skin caps of the Russians; so that many of our men struck with
the hilts at the faces of the enemy, as more effective than attempting
to cut with their blunt blades.In the article on English sword-blades to which I have referred, stress
is laid on the superiority of blades of spring steel, tempered so that
the tip can be bent round to the hilt without breaking or preventing the
blade assuming the straight immediately it is released.Now my
observations lead me to consider spring steel to be totally unfitted for
a sword-blade.The real Damascus blade that we have all read about, but
so few have seen, is as rigid as cast-iron, without any spring
whatever,--as rigid as the blade of a razor.The sword-blade which bends
is neither good for cut nor thrust, even in the hands of the most expert
and powerful swordsman.A blade of spring steel will not cut through the
bone; directly it encounters a hard substance, it quivers in the hand
and will not cut through.Let any sword-maker in Birmingham try
different blades in the hands of an expert swordsman on a green tree of
soft wood, and the rigid blade of well-tempered steel will cut four
times as deep as the blade of highly tempered spring steel which you can
bend into a circle, tip to hilt.My opinion is that the motto of a
sword-blade ought to be the same as the Duke of Sutherland's--"_Frangas
non flectes_, Thou mayest break but not bend"; and if blades could be
made that would neither break nor bend, so much the better.I believe that the manufacture of real Damascus steel blades is a lost
art.When serving in the Punjab about thirty years ago, I was well
acquainted with an old man in Lahore who had been chief armourer to
Runjeet Sing, and he has often told me that the real Damascus blades
contained a large percentage of arsenic amalgamated with the steel while
the blades were being forged, which greatly added to their hardness,
toughness, and strength, preserved the steel from rust, and enabled the
blades to be sharpened to a very fine edge.This old man's test for a
sword-blade was to get a good-sized fish, newly caught from the river,
lay it on a soft, yielding bed,--cotton quilt folded up, or any soft
yielding substance,--and the blade that did not cut the fish in two
across the thickest part behind the gills, cutting against the scales,
at one stroke, was considered of no account whatever.From what I have
seen no sword-blade that bends, however sharp it may be, will do that,
because the spring in the steel causes the blade to glance off the fish,
and the impetus of the cut is lost by the blade quivering in the hand.Nor will any of our straight sword-blades cut a large fish through in
this manner; whereas the curved Oriental blade, with a drawing cut,
severs it at once, because the curved blade presents much more cutting
surface.One revolution of a circular saw cuts much deeper into wood
than one stroke of a straight saw, although the length of the straight
saw may be equal to the circumference of the circular one.So it is with
sword-blades.A stroke from a curved blade, drawn through, cuts far
deeper than the stroke from a straight blade.[63]

I will mention one instance at Lucknow that came under my own notice of
the force of a sword-cut from a curved sword of rigid steel.There were
three brothers of the name of Ready in the Ninety-Third called David,
James, and John.They were all powerful, tall men, in the prime of life,
and all three had served through the Crimea.David was a sergeant, and
his two brothers were privates.When falling in for the assault on the
Begum's palace, John Ready took off his Crimean medal and gave it to his
brother David, telling him that he felt a presentiment that he would be
killed in that attack, and that David had better keep his medal, and
send it home to their mother.David tried to reason him out of his
fears, but to no purpose.John Ready replied that he had no fear, and
his mother might know that he had died doing his duty.Well, the assault
took place, and in the inner courts of the palace there was one division
held by a regiment of dismounted cavalry, armed with swords as keen as
razors, and circular shields, and the party of the Ninety-Third who got
into that court were far out-numbered on this occasion, as in fact we
were everywhere else.On entering James Ready was attacked by a _sowar_
armed with sword and shield.Ready's feather bonnet was knocked off, and
the _sowar_ got one cut at him, right over his head, which severed his
skull clean in two, the sword cutting right through his neck and
half-way down through the breast-bone.John Ready sprang to the
assistance of his brother, but too late; and although his bayonet
reached the side of his opponent and was driven home with a fatal
thrust, in doing so he came within the swoop of the same terrible sword,
wielded by the powerful arm of a tall man, and he also was cut right
through the left shoulder diagonally across the chest, and his head and
right arm were clean severed from the body.The _sowar_ delivered his
stroke of the sword at the same moment that he received the bayonet of
John Ready through his heart, and both men fell dead together.David
Ready, the sergeant, seized the _tulwar_ that had killed both his
brothers, and used it with terrible effect, cutting off heads of men as
if they had been mere heads of cabbage.When the fight was over I
examined that sword.It was of ordinary weight, well-balanced, curved
about a quarter-circle, as sharp as the sharpest razor, and the blade as
rigid as cast-iron.Now, my experience is that none of our very best
English swords could have cut like this one.A sword of that quality
would cut through a man's skull or thigh-bone without the least quiver,
as easily as an ordinary Birmingham blade would cut through a willow.I may also mention the case of a young officer named Banks, of the
Seventh Hussars, who was terribly cut up in charging through a band of
Ghazis.One leg was clean lopped off above the knee, the right arm cut
off, the left thigh and left arm both cut through the bone, each wound
produced by a single cut from a sharp, curved _tulwar_.I don't know if
the young fellow got over it;[64] but he was reported to be still alive,
and even cheerful when we marched from Lucknow.In this matter of sword-blades, I have no wish to dogmatise or to pose
as an authority; I merely state my observations and opinion, in the
hopes that they may lead to experiments being made.The sharpening of our cavalry swords, if still the same as
in 1857, receives far too little attention.FOOTNOTES:

[62] In which case they would have been simply ridden over.Mitchell's are quite true as regards curved
swords; but he forgets that the _point_ is the most effective attack
against Eastern swordsmen.APPENDIX D

THE OPIUM QUESTION


On the afternoon of the 19th August, 1892, I left Cawnpore for Lucknow.As I was a few minutes before time, I walked along the railway-platform
to see the engine, and, strange to relate, the engine attached to the
train which was to take me into Lucknow (under circumstances very
different from those of 1857) was No.In 1857 I had crossed the
Ganges in the ranks of the Ninety-Third Highlanders, with the figures 93
on the front of my cap, and here I was, under very different
circumstances, revisiting Lucknow for the first time thirty-five years
after, and the engine to the train was No.I need not say that I
lifted my hat to that engine.As a matter of fact, I never do pass the
old number without giving it a salute; but in this instance I looked
upon it as a happy omen for the success of my journey.I took my seat in the carriage, and shortly after was joined by a
gentleman whom I took to be a Mahommedan; but to my surprise he told me
that he was a Christian employed in the Educational Department, and that
he was going to Lucknow for a month's holiday.He appeared to be a man
of over sixty years of age, but said he was only fifty-four, and that he
would retire from Government service next year.Of course I introduced
the subject of the Mutiny, and asked him where he had been at the time.He stated that when the Mutiny broke out he was at school in Bareilly,
and that he was then a Mahommedan, but did not join in the rebellion;
that on the outbreak of the Mutiny, when all the Europeans were either
killed or fled from Bareilly, he had retired to his village near
Shahjehanpore, and remained there till order was re-established on the
advance of the English into Rohilcund in May, 1858, after Khan Bahadoor
Khan had reigned in Bareilly twelve months.In course of conversation I asked my companion if he could give any
reason why it was that the whole rural population of Oude had joined the
urban population against the British in 1857, whereas on the south side
of the Ganges the villagers were in favour of the British, where they
were not overawed by the mutineers?He told me a strange thing, and that
was that he was fully convinced that the main reason why the village
population of Oude joined the city population of Lucknow was owing to
the oppression caused by our introduction of the opium-tax among the
people.At first I misunderstood him, and thought I had come across an agent of
the Anti-Opium Society."So you are against Government control of the
opium-cultivation and sale of the drug," I said."I consider the tax on opium a most legitimate source of
revenue.What I mean is that although a just tax, it was a highly
obnoxious one to the citizens of Lucknow and the rural population of
Oude at the time of the Mutiny."He went on to state that although a
Christian convert from Mahommedanism and a strictly temperate man, he
had no sympathy with the anti-opium party; that he considered them a
most dangerous set of fanatics, who would set the whole country in
rebellion again before a twelve-month if they could get the Government
to adopt their narrow-minded views.Regarding 1857, he continued, and I
quote his exact words, as I noted them down immediately after I got to
the hotel:

"Under the rule of the Nawabs of Lucknow many taxes were imposed, which
were abolished by the British; but in their stead the opium-tax was
introduced, which was the most unpopular tax that could have been
devised, because it touched every one, from the _coolie_ in the bazaar
to the noble in his palace.Before the annexation of Oude opium was
untaxed, and was largely consumed by all classes of the people, both in
the capital and in the villages.Though the mass of the people were
well-affected to British rule in general, disloyal agitators had merely
to cite the opium-tax as a most obnoxious and oppressive impost, to
raise the whole population against the British Government, and the same
would be the case again, if ever the British Government were weak enough
to be led by the Anti-Opium Society.""Then," said I, "since you are so much against the Anti-Opium Society, I
suppose you are also against Christian missionaries.""That by no means
follows," was the answer."Many of our most Christian and able
missionaries have as little sympathy with the anti-opium propagandists
as I have.The true missionary aims at reforming the people through the
people, not by compelling moral reformation through the Government,
which would be merely a return to the Inquisition of Rome in another
form.I would encourage missionaries by every possible means; but they
must be broad-minded, earnest, pious men, who mind their own business,
and on no pretence whatever attempt to dictate to Government, or to
control its action either in the matter of taxation or in any other way.I would never encourage men who go about the country railing against the
Government for collecting revenue from one of the most just sources that
can be named.Missionaries of experience know that the mass of the
population are miserably poor, and a pill of opium is almost the only
stimulant in which they indulge.Then, why attempt to deprive them of
it, merely to please a score or so of sentimental faddists?Let the
missionaries mind their own business, and render to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.Let them
confine themselves to proclaiming the Gospel to the heathen, and teach
the Bible in their schools; but don't allow them to mix in politics, or
in any way interfere with the government or taxation of the country.I
would throw the English education of the people more into the hands of
the missionaries.Our Government schools are antichristian, and are
making infidels of the people."THE END

    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

[Illustration]

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.Saw seven or eight
hobaras, but too windy for the hawks to be flown.Captain B. chased a
gazelle himself, and had the good fortune to catch him.As soon as an
Arab secures an animal, he immediately cuts its throat, repeating
"Bismillah, Allah Akbar," "In the name (of God), God is great."We marched seventeen miles to a place called Aly Ben Own, the name of
the saint buried close by.The plain we crossed must have been once
thickly inhabited, as there were many remains.We were joined by more
Arabs, and our force continued to augment.The Bey, being in want of
horses, the same system of seizing them was adopted as with the camels.One splendid morning that broke over our encampment we had an
opportunity of witnessing Africa's most gorgeous scenery.[35] Plenty of
hobaras; they fly like a goose.The hawks took two or three of them,
also some hares.The poor hare does not know what to make of the hawks;
after a little running, it gives itself up for death, only first dodging
out of the bird's pounce, or hiding itself in a tuft of grass or a bush,
but which it is not long allowed to do, for the Arabs soon drive it out
from its vain retreat.The hawk, when he seizes the hare with one claw,
catches hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the
other; a strong leather strap is also fastened from one leg to the
other, to prevent them from being pulled open or strained.We came upon
a herd of small deer, called ebba, which are a little larger than the
gazelle, but they soon bounded beyond our pursuit, leaving us scarcely
time to admire their delicate make and unapproachable speed.We crossed a range of hills into another plain, at the extremity of
which lies Ghafsa.The surface was naked, with the exception of tufts of
strong, rushy grass, almost a sure indication of hares, and of which we
started a great number.We saw another description of bird, called
rhaad, [36] with white wings, which flew like a pigeon, but more
swiftly.Near our tract were the remains of a large tank of ancient
Roman construction.Marched fourteen or fifteen
miles to Zwaneah, which means "little garden," though there is no sign
of such thing, unless it be the few oranges, dates, and pomegranates
which they find here.We had water from a tank of modern construction;
some remains were close to the camp, the ancient cistern and stone duct
leading from the hills.We had two thousand camels with the camp and
following it, for which not a single atom of provender is carried, the
camels subsisting scantily upon the coarse grass, weeds or thorns, which
the soil barely affords.The camel is very fond of sharp, prickly
thorns.You look upon the animal, with its apparently most tender mouth,
chopping the sharpest thorns it can find, full of amazement!Some of the
chiefs who have lately joined us, have brought their wives with them,
riding on camels in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine.These
palanquins have a kind of mast and shrouds, from which a bell is slung,
tinkling with the swinging motion of the camel.This rude contrivance
makes the camel more than ever "the ship of the Desert."Several fine
horses were brought in as presents to the Bey, one a very fine mare.Our next march was towards Ghafsa, about twenty miles off.We were
joined by a considerable number of fresh Arabs, who "played at powder,"
and kept firing and galloping before the Bey the whole day; some of them
managed themselves and their arms and horses with great address,
balancing the firelock on their heads, firing it, twisting it round,
throwing it into the air, and catching it again, and all without once
losing the command of their horses.An accident happened amidst the fun;
two of the parties came in contact, and one of them received a dreadful
gash on the forehead.The dresses of some of them were very rich, and
looked very graceful on horseback.A ride over sand-hills brought us in
view of the town, embedded in olive and date-trees, looking fresh and
green after our hot and dusty march; it lay stretched at the foot of a
range of hills, which formed the boundaries of another extensive plain.We halted at Ghafsa, [37] which is almost a mass of rubbish filled with
dirty people, although there are plenty of springs about, principally
hot and mineral waters.Although the Moors, by their religion, are
enjoined the constant use of the bath, yet because they do not change
their linen and other clothes, they are always very dirty.They do not,
however, exceed the Maltese and Sicilians, and many other people of the
neighbourhood, in filth, and perhaps the Moors are cleaner in their
hahits than they.The Arabs are extremely disgusting, and their women
are often seen in a cold winter's evening, standing with their legs
extended over a smoky wood fire, holding up their petticoats, and
continuing in this indelicate position for hours together.In these Thermae, or hot, sulphurous, and other mineral springs, is the
phenomenon of the existence of fish and small snakes.These were
observed by our tourists, but I shall give three other authorities
besides them.Shaw says: "'The Ouri-el-Nout,' _i.e_., 'Well of Fish,'
and the springs of Ghasa and Toser, nourish a number of small fishes of
the mullet and perch kind, and are of an easy digestion.Of the like
quality are the other waters of the Jereed, all of them, after they
become cold, being the common drink of the inhabitants."Sir Grenville
Temple remarks: "The thermometer in the water marked ninety-five
degrees; and, what is curious, a considerable number of fish is found in
this stream, which measure from four to six inches in length, and
resemble, in some degree, the gudgeon, having a delicate flavour.Bruce
mentions a similar fact, but he says he saw it in the springs of
Feriana.Part of the ancient structure of these baths still exists, and
pieces of inscriptions are observed in different places."Honneger has made a sketch of this fish.The wood-cut represents it
one half the natural size:

[Illustration]

The snake, not noticed by former tourists, has been observed by Mr.Honneger, which nourishes itself entirely upon the fish.The wood-cut
represents the snake half its natural size:

[Illustration]

The fish and the snake live together, though not very amicably, in the
hot-springs.Prince Puekler Muskau, who travelled in Tunis, narrates
that, "Near the ruins of Utica was a warm spring, in whose almost hot
waters we found several turtles, _which seemed to inhabit this basin_."However, perhaps, there is no such extraordinary difficulty in the
apprehension of this phenomenon, for "The Gulf Stream," on leaving the
Gulf of Mexico, "has a temperature of more than 27 deg.(centigrade), or
80-6/10 degrees of Fahrenheit."[38]

Many a fish must pass through and live in this stream.And after all,
since water is the element of fish, and is hotter or colder in all
regions, like the air, the element of man, which he breathes, warmer or
cooler, according to clime and local circumstances--there appear to be
no physical objections in the way of giving implicit credence to our
tourists.Water is so abundant, that the adjoining plain might be easily
irrigated, and planted with ten thousand palms and forests of olives.God is bountiful in the Desert, but man wilfully neglects these aqueous
riches springing up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning
simoum!In one of the groves we met a dervish, who immediately set about
charming our Boab.He began by an incantation, then seized him round the
middle, and, stooping a little, lifted him on his shoulders, continuing
the while the incantation.He then put him on his feet again, and, after
several attempts, appeared to succeed in bringing off his stomach
something in the shape of leaden bullets, which he then, with an air of
holy swagger, presented to the astonished guard of the Bey.The dervish
next spat on his patient's hands, closed them in his own, then smoothed
him down the back like a mountebank smooths his pony, and stroked also
his head and beard; and, after further gentle and comely ceremonies of
this sort, the charming of the charmer finished, and the Boab presented
the holy man with his fee.We dined at the Kaed's house; this
functionary was a very venerable man, a perfect picture of a patriarch
of the olden Scriptural times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.There was
not a single article of furniture in the room, except a humble sofa,
upon which he sat.We inspected the old Kasbah at Ghafsa, which is in nearly a state of
ruin, and looked as if it would soon be down about our ears.It is an
irregular square, and built chiefly of the remains of ancient edifices.It was guarded by fifty Turks, whose broken-down appearance was in
perfect harmony with the citadel they inhabited.The square in a
building is the favourite form of the Moors and Mohammedans generally;
the Kaaba of Mecca, the _sanctum sanctorum_, is a square.The Moors
endeavour to imitate the sacred objects of their religion in every way,
even in the commonest affairs of human existence, whilst likewise their
troops of wives and concubines are only an earthly foretaste and an
earnest of the celestial ladies they expect to meet hereafter.We saw them making oil, which was in a very primitive fashion.The
oil-makers were nearly all women.The olives were first ground between
stones worked by the hands, until they became of the consistence of
paste, which was then taken down to the stream and put into a wooden tub
with water.On being stirred up, the oil rises to the top, which they
skim off with their hands and put into skins or jars; when thus skimmed,
they pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve, the water running off;
the stones and pulp are then saved for firing.But in this way much of
the oil is lost, as may be seen by the greasy surface of the water below
where this rude process is going on.Among the oil-women, we noticed a
girl who would have been very pretty and fascinating had she washed
herself instead of the olives.We entered an Arab house inhabited by
some twenty persons, chiefly women, who forthwith unceremoniously took
off our caps, examined very minutely all our clothes with an excited
curiosity, laughed heartily when we put our hands in our pockets, and
wished to do the same, and then pulled our hair, looking under our faces
with amorous glances.On the hill overlooking the town, we also met two
women screaming frightfully and tearing their faces; we learned that one
of them had lost her child.The women make the best blankets here with
handlooms, and do the principal heavy work.We saw some hobaras, also a bird called getah, smaller than a partridge,
something like a ptarmigan, with its summer feathers, and head shaped
like a quail.The Bey sent two live ones to R., besides a couple of
large jerboahs of this part, called here, _gundy_.They are much like
the guinea-pig, but of a sandy colour, and very soft and fine, like a
young hare.The jerboahs in the neighbourhood of Tunis are certainly
more like the rat.The other day, near the south-west gates, we fell in
with a whole colony of them--which, however, were the lesser animal, or
Jerd species--who occupied an entire eminence to themselves, the
sovereignty of which seemed to have been conceded to them by the Bey of
Tunis.They looked upon us as intruders, and came very near to us, as if
asking us why we had the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of their
republic.The ground here in many places was covered with a substance
like the rime of a frosty morning; it tastes like salt, and from it they
get nitre.The water which we drank was
brought from Ghafsa: the Bey drinks water brought from Tunis.We marched
across a vast plain, covered with the salt just mentioned, which was
congealed in shining heaps around bushes or tufts of grass, and among
which also scampered a few hares.We encamped at a place called
Ghorbatah.Close to the camp was a small shallow stream, on each side of
which grew many canes; we bathed in the stream, and felt much refreshed.The evening was pleasantly cool, like a summer evening in England, and
reminded us of the dear land of our birth.Numerous plains in North
Africa are covered with saline and nitrous efflorescence; to the
presence of these minerals is owing the inexhaustible fertility of the
soil, which hardly ever receives any manure, only a little stubble being
occasionally burnt.We saw flights of the getah, and of another bird called the gedur,
nearly the same, but rather lighter in colour.When they rise from the
ground, they make a curious noise, something like a partridge.We were
unusually surprised by a flight of locusts, not unlike grasshoppers, of
about two inches long, and of a reddish colour.Halted by the dry bed of a river, called Furfouwy.A pool supplied the
camp: in the mountains, at a distance, there was, however, a delicious
spring, a stream of liquid pearls in these thirsty lands!A bird called
mokha appeared now and then; it is about the size of a nightingale, and
of a white light-brown colour.We seldom heard such sweet notes as this
bird possesses.Its flying is beautifully novel and curious; it runs on
the ground, and now and then stops and rises about fifteen feet from the
surface, giving, as it ascends, two or three short slow whistles, when
it opens its graceful tail and darts down to the ground, uttering
another series of melodious whistles, but much quicker than when it
rises.We continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was
now flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.About eight miles from Furfouwy, we came to a large patch of date-trees,
watered by many springs, but all of them hot.Under the grateful shade
of the lofty palm were flowers and fruits in commingled sweetness and
beauty.Here was the village of Dra-el-Hammah, surrounded, like all the
towns of the Jereed, with date-groves and gardens.The houses were most
humbly built of mud and bricks.After a scorching march, we encamped
just beyond, having made only ten miles.Saw quantities of bright soft
spar, called talc.Here also the ground was covered with a saline
effloresence.Near us were put up about a dozen blue cranes, the only
birds seen to-day.A gazelle was caught, and others chased.We
particularly observed huge patches of ground covered with salt, which,
at a distance, appeared just like water.Toser.--The Bey's Palace.--Blue Doves.--The town described.--Industry

arrived at the top of a rising ground, at the base of which was situate
the famous Toser, the head-quarters of the camp in the Jereed, and as
far as it goes.Behind the city was a forest of date-trees, and beyond
these and all around, as far as the eye could wander, was an
immeasurable waste--an ocean of sand--a great part of which we could
have sworn was water, unless told to the contrary.We were met, before
entering Toser, with some five or six hundred Arabs, who galloped before
the Bey, and fired as usual.The people stared at us Christians with
open mouths; our dress apparently astonished them.At Toser, the Bey
left his tent and entered his palace, so called in courtesy to his
Highness, but a large barn of a house, without any pretensions.We had
also a room allotted to us in this palace, which was the best to be
found in the town, though a small dark affair.Toser is a miserable
assemblage of mud and brick huts, of very small dimensions, the beams
and the doors being all of date-wood.The gardens, however, under the
date-trees are beautiful, and abundantly watered with copious streams,
all of which are warm, and in one of which we bathed ourselves and felt
new vigour run through our veins.We took a walk in the gardens, and
were surprised at the quantities of doves fluttering among the
date-trees; they were the common blue or Barbary doves.In the environs
of Mogador, these doves are the principal birds shot.Toser, or Touzer, the _Tisurus_ of ancient geography, is a considerable
town of about six thousand souls, with several villages in its
neighbourhood.The impression of Toser made upon our tourists agrees with that of the
traveller, Desfontaines, who writes of it in 1784:--"The Bey pitched his
tent on the right side of the city, if such can be called a mass of
_mud-houses_."Shaw,
who says that "the villages of the Jereed are built of mud-walls and
rafters of palm-trees."Evidently, however, some improvement has been
made of late years.The Arabs of Toser, on the contrary, and which very
natural, protested to the French scientific commission that Toser was
the finest city in El-Jereed.They pretend that it has an area as large
as Algiers, surrounded with a mud wall, twelve or fifteen feet high, and
crenated.In the centre is a vast open space, which serves for a
market-place.Toser has mosques, schools, Moorish baths--a luxury rare
on the confines of the Desert, fondouks or inns, &c. The houses have
flat terraces, and are generally well-constructed, the greater part
built from the ruins of a Roman town; but many are now dilapidated from
the common superstitious cause of not repairing or rebuilding old
houses.The choice material for building is brick, mostly unbaked or
sun-dried.Toser, situate in a plain, is commanded from the north-west by a little
rocky mountain, whence an abundant spring takes its source, called
_Meshra_, running along the walls of the city southward, divides itself
afterwards in three branches, waters the gardens, and, after having
irrigated the plantations of several other villages, loses itself in the
sand at a short distance.The wells within the city of Toser are
insufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, who fetch water
from Wad Meshra.The neighbouring villages are Belad-el-Ader, Zin,
Abbus; and the sacred villages are Zaouweeat, of Tounseea, Sidi Ali Bou
Lifu, and Taliraouee.The Arabs of the open country, and who deposit
their grain in and trade with these villages, are Oulad Sidi Sheikh,
Oulad Sidi Abeed, and Hammania.The dates of Toser are esteemed of the
finest quality.Walked about the town; several of the inhabitants are very wealthy.The
dead saints are, however, here, and perhaps everywhere else in Tunis,
more decently lodged, and their marabets are real "whitewashed
sepulchres."They make many burnouses at Toser, and every house presents
the industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly moving.We tasted
the leghma, or "tears of the date," for the first time, and rather liked
it.On going to shoot doves, we, to our astonishment, put up a snipe.The weather was very hot; went to shoot doves in the cool of the
evening.The Bey administers justice, morning and evening, whilst in the
Jereed.An Arab made a present of a fine young ostrich to the Bey, which
his Highness, after his arrival in Tunis, sent to R. The great man here
is the Sheikh Tahid, who was imprisoned for not having the tribute ready
for the Bey.The tax imposed is equivalent to two bunches for each
date-tree.The Sheikh has to collect them, paying a certain yearly sum
when the Bey arrives, a species of farming-out.It was said that he is
very rich, and could well find the money.The dates are almost the only
food here, and the streets are literally gravelled with their stones.Santa Maria again returned his horse to the Bey, and got another in its
stead.He is certainly a man of _delicate_ feeling.This gentleman
carried his impudence so far that he even threatened some of the Bey's
officers with the supreme wrath of the French Government, unless they
attended better to his orders.A new Sheikh was installed, a good thing
for the Bey's officers, as many of them got presents on the occasion.We blessed our stars that a roof was over our heads to shield us from
the burning sun.We blew an ostrich-egg, had the contents cooked, and
found it very good eating.They are sold for fourpence each, and it is
pretended that one makes an ample meal for twelve persons.We are
supplied with leghma every morning; it tastes not unlike cocoa-nut milk,
but with more body and flavour.R. very unwell, attributed it to his
taking copious draughts of the leghma.Rode out of an evening; there was
a large encampment of Arabs outside the town, thoroughly sun-burnt,
hardy-looking fellows, some of them as black as <DW64>s.Many people in
Toser have sore eyes, and several with the loss of one eye, or nearly
so; opthalmia, indeed, is the most prevalent disease in all Barbary.The
neighbourhood of the Desert, where the greater part of the year the air
is filled with hot particles of sand, is very unfavourable to the sight;
the dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed houses also greatly injures
the eyes.But the Moors pretend that lime-washing is necessary to the
preservation of the houses from the weather, as well as from filth of
all sorts.We think really it is useful, by preventing dirty people in
many cases from being eaten up by their own filth and vermin,
particularly the Jews, the Tunisian Jews being the dirtiest persons in
the Regency.The lime-wash is the grand _sanitary_ instrument in North
Africa.There are little birds that frequent the houses, that might be called
Jereed sparrows, and which the Arabs name boo-habeeba, or "friend of my
father;" but their dress and language are very different, having reddish
breasts, being of a small size, and singing prettily.Shaw mentions them
under the name of the Capsa-sparrow, but he is quite wrong in making
them as large as the common house-sparrow.He adds: "It is all over of a
lark-colour, excepting the breast, which is somewhat lighter, and
shineth like that of a pigeon.The boo-habeeba has a note infinitely
preferable to that of the canary, or nightingale."He says that all
attempts to preserve them alive out of the districts of the Jereed have
failed.R. has brought several home from that country, which were alive
whilst I was in Tunis.There are also many at the Bardo in cages, that
live in this way as long as other birds.Went to see the houses of the inhabitants: they were nearly all the
same, the furniture consisting of a burnouse-loom, a couple of
millstones, and a quantity of basins, plates, and dishes, hung upon the
walls for effect, seldom being used; there were also some skins of
grain.The beams across the rooms, which are very high, are hung with
onions, dates, and pomegranates; the houses are nearly all of one story.Some of the women are pretty, with large long black eyes and lashes;
they colour the lower lid black, which does not add to their beauty,
though it shows the bewitching orb more fully and boldly.They were
exceedingly dirty and ragged, wearing, nevertheless, a profusion of
ear-rings, armlets, anclets, bracelets, and all sorts of _lets_, with a
thousand talismanic charms hanging from their necks upon their ample
bosoms, which latter, from the habit of not wearing stays, reach as low
down as their waists.They wrap up the children in swaddling-clothes,
and carry them behind their backs when they go out.Two men were bastinadoed for stealing a horse, and not telling where
they put him; every morning they were to be flogged until they divulged
their hiding-place.A man brought in about a foot of horse's skin, on which was the Bey's
mark, for which he received another horse.This is always done when any
animal dies belonging to the Beys, the man in whose hands the animal is,
receiving a new one on producing the part of the skin marked.The Bey
and his ministers and mamelukes amused themselves with shooting at a
mark.The Bey and his mamelukes also took diversion in spoiling the appearance
of a very nice young horse; they daubed hieroglyphics upon his shoulders
and loins, and dyed the back where the saddle is placed, and the three
legs below the knee with henna, making the other leg look as white as
possible.Another grey horse, a very fine one, was also cribbed.We may
remark here, that there were very few fine horses to be met with, all
the animals looking poor and miserable, whilst these few fine ones fell
into the hands of the Bey.It is probable, however, that the Arabs kept
their best and most beautiful horses out of the way, while the camp was
moving among them.The bastinadoes with which he
had been treated were inflicted on his bare person, cold water being
applied thereto, which made the punishment more severe.After receiving
one hundred, he said he would shew his hiding-place; and some people
being sent with him, dug a hole where he pointed out, but without coming
to anything.This was done several times, but with the same effect.He
was then locked up in chains till the following morning.Millions of
dollars lie buried by the Arabs at this moment in different parts of
Barbary, especially in Morocco, perhaps the half of which will never be
found, the owners of them having died before they could point out their
hoarded treasures to their relatives, as but a single person is usually
in the secret.Money is in this way buried by tribes, who have nothing
whatever to fear from their sovereigns and their sheikhs; they do it
from immemorial custom.It is for this reason the Arabs consider that
under all ancient ruins heaps of money are buried, placed there by men
or demons, who hold the shining hoards under their invincible spell.They cannot comprehend how European tourists can undertake such long
journeys, merely for the purpose of examining old heaps of stones, and
making plans and pictures of such rubbish.When any person attempts to
convince the Arabs that this is the sole object, they only laugh with
incredulity.Went to Nefta, a ride of about fourteen miles, lying somewhat nearer the
Sahara than Toser.The country on the right was undulating sand, on the
left an apparently boundless ocean, where lies, as a vast sheet of
liquid fire, when the sun shines on it, the now long celebrated Palus
Libya.In this so-called lake no water is visible, except a small marsh
like the one near Toser, where we went duck-shooting.Our party was very
respectable, consisting of the Agha of the Arabs, two or three of the
Bey's mamelukes, the Kaed of the Jereed, whose name is Braun, and fifty
or sixty Arab guards, besides ourselves.On entering Nefta, the escort
immediately entered, according to custom, a marabet (that of Sidi Bou
Aly), Captain B. and R. meanwhile standing outside.There were two famous saints here, one of whom was a hundred years of
age.The other, Sidi Mustapha Azouz, had the character of being a very
clever and good man, which also his intelligent and benevolent
appearance betokened, and not a fanatic, like Amour Abeda of Kairwan.There were at the time of our visit to him about two hundred people in
his courtyard, who all subsisted on his charities.We were offered
dates, kouskousou, [39] and a seed which they call sgougou, and which
has the appearance of dried apple-seed.The Arabs eat it with honey,
first dipping their fingers into the honey, and then into the seed,
which deliciously sticks to the honey.The Sheikh's saint also
distributed beads and rosaries.He gave R. a bag of sgougou-seed, as
well as some beads.These two Sheikhs are objects of most religious
veneration amongst all true believers, and there is nothing which would
not be done at their bidding.Nefta, the Negeta of the ancients, is the frontier town of the Tunisian
territories from the south, being five days' journey, or about
thirty-five or forty leagues from the oases of Souf, and fifteen days'
from Ghadumes.Nefta is not so much a town as an agglomeration of
villages, separated from one another by gardens, and occupying an extent
of surface twice the size that of the city of Algiers.These villages
are Hal Guema, Mesaba, Zebda Ouled, Sherif, Beni Zeid, Beni Ali, Sherfa,
and Zaouweeah Sidi Ahmed.The position of Nefta and its environs is very picturesque.The principal source, which, under the name of Wad Nefta,
takes its rise at the north of the city, in the midst of a movement of
earth, enters the villages of Sherfa and Sidi Ahmed; divides them in
two, and fecundates its gardens planted with orange-trees, pomegranates,
and fig-trees.The same spring, by the means of ducts of earth, waters a
forest of date-trees which extends some leagues.A regulator of the
water (kaed-el-ma) distributes it to each proprietor of the plantation.The houses of Nefta are built generally of brick; some with taste and
luxury; the interior is ornamented with Dutch tiles brought from Tunis.Each quarter has its mosque and school, and in the centre of the group
of villages is a place called Rebot, on the banks of Wad Nefta, which
serves for a common market.Here are quarters specially devoted to the
aristocratic landed proprietors, and others to the busy merchants.The
Shereefs are the genuine nobles, or seigneurs of Nefta, from among whom
the Bey is wont to choose the Governors of the city.The complexion of
the population is dark, from its alliance with Negress slaves, like most
towns advanced in the Desert.They
are strict observers of the law, and very hospitable to strangers.Captain B., however, thought that, had he not been under the protection
of the Bey, his head would not have been worth much in these districts.Every traveller almost forms a different opinion, and frequently the
very opposite estimate, respecting the strangers amongst whom he is
sojourning.A few Jewish artizans have always been tolerated here, on
condition of wearing a black handkerchief round their heads, and not
mount a horse, &c. Recently the Bey, however, by solemn decrees, has
placed the Jews exactly on the same footing of rights and privileges as
the rest of his subjects.Nefta is the intermediate _entrepot_ of commerce which Tunis pours
towards the Sahara, and for this reason is called by the Arabs, "the
gate of Tunis;" but the restrictive system established by the Turks
during late years at Ghadumes, has greatly damaged the trade between the
Jereed and the Desert.The movement of the markets and caravans takes
place at the beginning of spring, and at the end of summer.Only a
portion of the inhabitants is devoted to commerce, the rich landed
proprietory and the Shereefs representing the aristocracy, lead the
tranquil life of nobles, the most void of care, and, perhaps, the
happiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dreamed.The oasis of
Nefta, indeed, is said to be the most poetic of the Desert; its gardens
are delicious; its oranges and lemons sweet; its dates the finest fruit
in the "land of dates."Nearly all the women are pretty, of that beauty
peculiar to the Oriental race; and the ladies who do not expose
themselves to the fierce sun of the day, are as fair as Mooresses.Santa Maria left for Ghabs, to which place there is not a correct route
laid down in any chart.There are three routes, but the wells of one are
only known to travellers, a knowledge which cannot be dispensed with in
these dry regions.The wells of the other two routes are known to the
bordering tribes alone, who, when they have taken a supply of water,
cover them up with sand, previously laying a camel-skin over the
well-mouth, to prevent the sand falling into the water, so that, while
dying with thirst, you might be standing on a well and be none the
wiser.The Frenchman has taken with him an escort of twelve men.The
weather is cooler, with a great deal of wind, raising and darkening the
sky with sand; even among the dategroves our eyes and noses were like so
many sand-quarries.Sheikh Tahib has been twice subjected to corporal punishment in the same
way as before mentioned, with the addition of fifty, but they cannot
make him bleed as they wish.He declares he has not got the money, and
that he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces.As he has
collected a great portion of the tribute of the people, one cannot much
pity the lying rogue.We were amused with the snake-charmers.These gentry are a company under
the protection of their great saint Sidi Aysa, who has long gone
upwards, but also is now profitably employed in helping the juggling of
these snake-mountebanks.These fellows take their snakes about in small
bags or boxes, which are perfectly harmless, their teeth and poison-bags
being extracted.They carry them in their bosoms, put them in their
mouths, stuffing a long one in of some feet in length, twist them around
their arms, use them as a whip to frighten the people, in the meanwhile
screaming out and crying unto their Heavenly protector for help, the
bystanders devoutly joining in their prayers.The snake-charmers usually
perform other tricks, such as swallowing nails and sticking an iron bar
in their eyes; and they wear their hair long like women, which gives
them a very wild maniacal look.Three of the mamelukes and ourselves went to Wedyen, a town and
date-wood about eight miles from Toser, to the left.The date-grove is
extensive, and there are seven villages in it of the same name.We slept
in the house of the Sheikh, who complained that the Frenchman, in
passing that way, had allowed his escort to plunder, and actually bound
the poor Sheikh, threatening him on his remonstrating.What conduct for
Christians to teach these people!One morning before daylight, we were on horseback, and _en route_
towards the hills, for the purpose of shooting loted, as they call a
species of deer found here.The ground in the neighbourhood of Wedyen is
tossed about like a hay-field, and volcanic looking.About four miles
off we struck into the rocks, on each side of our path, rising
perpendicularly in fantastic shapes.On reaching the highest ground, the
view was exceedingly wild.Much of the rock appeared as if it had only
just been cooled from a state of fusion; there was also a quantity of
tuffo rock, similar to that in the neighbourhood of Naples.The first
animal we saw was a wolf, which, standing on the sky-line of the
opposite hill, looked gigantic.The deep valley between, however,
prevented our nearer approach.We soon after came on a loted, who took to his heels, turning round a
mass of rock; but, soon after, he almost met as, and we had a view of
him within forty yards.Several shots were fired at him without effect,
and he at last made his escape, with a speed which defied all our
attempts at following him.Dismounting, the Sheikh Ali, of the Arab
tribe Hammama, who was with us, and who is the greatest deer-stalker in
the country, preceded us a little distance to look out for deer, the
marks of which were here very numerous.After a short time, an Arab
brought information of a herd of some thirty, with a good many young
ones; but our endeavours to have a shot at them were fruitless, though
one of the Arabs got near enough to loose the dogs at them, and a
greyhound was kicked over for his pains.We saw no more of them; but our
want of success was not surprising, silence not being in the least
attended to, and our party was far too large.The Arabs have such a
horrible habit of vociferation, that it is a wonder they ever take any
game at all.About the hills was scattered a great variety of aromatic
plants, quantities of shells, and whole oyster-beds, looking almost as
fresh as if they had been found by the sea-side.On our return from Toser, we had an extensive view of the Sahara, an
ocean as far as the eye could see, of what one would have taken his oath
was water, the shores, inlets, and bays being clearly defined, but, in
reality, nothing but salt scattered on the surface.Several islets were
apparently breaking its watery expanse, but these also were only heaps
of sand raised from the surrounding flat.The whole country, hills,
plains and deserts, gave us an idea as if the materials had been thrown
together for manufacture, and had never been completed.Nevertheless
these savage deserts of boundless extent are as complete in their kind
as the smiling meadows and fertile corn-fields of England, each being
perfect in itself, necessary to the grand whole of creation, and forming
an essential portion of the works of Divine Providence.The Sheikh Tahib's gardens were sold for 15,000 piastres, his wife also
added to this 1,000, and he was set at liberty.The dates have been
coming in to a great amount.The
principal are:--Degalah, the most esteemed, which are very sweet and
almost transparent.Captain B. preferred the Trungah, another first-rate
sort, which are plum-shaped, and taste something like a plum.There are
also the Monachah, which are larger than the other two, dryer and more
mealy, and not so sweet as Degalah, and other sorts.The dates were very
fine, though in no very great abundance, the superior state of ripeness
being attributed to there only being a single day of rain during the
past year in the Jereed.Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the
tree cannot have too much water.The tent-pitchers of the camp went round and performed, in mask, actions
of the most revolting description, some being dressed as women, and
dancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner.One fellow went up
to R., who was just on the point of knocking him down, when, seeing the
Treasurer of the Bey cracking his sides with laughter, he allowed the
brute to go off under such high patronage.It was even said that these
fellows were patronized by his Highness.But, on all Moorish feastdays,
lascivious actions of men and women are an indispensable part of their
entertainment.This is the worst side of the character of the Moors.The
Moorish women were never so profligate as since the arrival of the
French in Algeria.One of the greatest chiefs, Sultan Kaed, of the Hammama has just died.He was an extremely old man, and it is certain that people live to a
good old age in this burning clime.During his life, he had often
distinguished himself, and lastly against the French, before
Constantina.Whilst in the hills one day, we came suddenly upon a set of
Arabs, about nine in number, who took to their heels on seeing us.A man
has just been killed near this place, probably by the same gang.For
robbery and murder, no hills could be better fitted, the passes being so
intricate, and the winds and turns so sudden and sharp.The Sheikh Ali
brought in two loteds, a female and its young one, which he had shot.The head of the loted is like a deer's, but the eye is further up: it is
about a fallowdeer's size.The female has not the beard like a goat, but
long hair, reaching from the head to the bottom of the chest, and over
the fore-legs.These loteds were taken in consequence of an order from
the Bey, that they should not return without some.On our march back to Tunis, we encamped for two days by the foot of a
range of hills at Sheesheeah, about ten miles off.The water, brought
from some distance, was bad and salt.We proceeded to Ghortabah, our old place.Two of the prisoners (about
twelve of whom we had with us), and one of the Turks, died from the
excessive heat.The two couriers that were sent with despatches for the
Government were attacked near this place by the Arabs, and the horse of
one was so injured, that it was necessary to kill him; the man who rode
the horse was also shot through the leg.This was probably in revenge
for the exactions of the Bey of the Camp on the tribes.On our return to Ghafsa, we had rain, hail, and high wind, and
exceedingly cold--a Siberian winter's day on the verge of the scorching
desert.The ground, where there was clay, very slippery; the camels
reeled about as if intoxicated.The consequence was, it was long before
the tents came up, and we endured much from this sudden change of the
weather.Our sufferings were, however, nothing as compared to others,
for during the day, ten men were brought in dead, from the cold (three
died four days before from heat), principally Turks; and, had there been
no change in the temperature, we cannot tell how many would have shared
the same fate.Many of the camels, struggling against the clayey soil,
could not come up.Eight more men were shortly buried, and three were missing.The sudden
transition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of
the next, probably gave the latter a treble power, producing these
disastrous effects, the poor people being sadly ill-clad, and quite
unprepared for such extreme rigour.Besides, on our arrival at the camp,
all the money in Europe could not have purchased us the required
comforts, or rather necessaries, to preserve our health.We were exceedingly touched on hearing of the
death of a little girl, whom we saw driven out of a kitchen, in which
the poor helpless little thing had taken refuge from the inclemency of
the weather.Santa Maria arrived from Ghabs without accident, having scarcely seen a
soul the whole of the way.He certainly was an enterprizing fellow,
worthy of imitation.He calculated the distance from Ghabs to Toser at
200 miles.There are a number of towns in the districts of Ghabs better
built than those of Nefta and Toser; Ghabs river is also full of water
and the soil of the country is very fertile.The dates are not so good
as those of the Jereed.Ghabs is about 130 miles from Ghafsa.We here
took our farewell of Santa Maria; he went to Beja, the head-quarters of
the summer-camp: thence, of course, he would proceed to Algiers, to give
an account of his _espionage_.Next season, he said, he would go to
Tripoli and Ghadames; he had been many years in North Africa, and spoke
Arabic fluently.We next marched to Byrlafee, about twenty miles, and ninety-one from
Toser, where there are the ruins of an old town.The weather continued
cold and most wintry.Here is a very ancient well still in use.Fragments of cornices and pillars are strewn about.The foundations of
houses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up
the centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are
all that remain.We had now much wind, but no rain.A great many camels and horses
perished.Altogether, the number of camels that died on the return of
the camp, was 550.The price of a camel varies from 60 to 200 piastres.Many good ones were sold at the camp for eighty piastres each, or about
two pounds ten shillings, English money.A good sheep was disposed of
for four or five piastres, or about three shillings.A horse in the extremities of nature, or near to
the _articulo mortis_, was sold for a piastre, eight pence; a camel, in
a like situation, was sold for a piastre and a half.A tolerably good
horse in Tunis sells at from 800 to 1000 piastres.There are the remains of an aqueduct at Gilma, and several other
buildings, the capitals of the pillars being elaborately worked.It is
seen that nearly the entire surface of Tunis is covered with remains of
aqueducts, Roman, Christian, and Moorish.If railways be applied to this
country--the French, are already talking about forming one from Algiers
to Blidah, across the Mitidjah--unquestionably along the lines will be
constructed ducts for water, which could thus be distributed over the
whole country.Instead of the camels of the "Bey of the Camp" carrying
water from Tunis to the Jereed, the railway would take from Zazwan, the
best and most delicious water in the Regency, to the dry deserts of the
Jereed, with the greatest facility.As to railways paying in this
country, the resources of Tunis, if developed, could pay anything.Marching onwards about eighteen miles, we encamped two or three beyond
an old place called Sidi-Ben-Habeeba.A man murdered a woman from
jealousy in the camp, but made his escape.Almost every eminence we
passed was occupied with the remains of some ancient fort, or temple.There was a good deal of corn in small detached patches, but it must be
remembered, the north-western provinces are the corn-districts.In the course of the following three days, we reached Sidi-Mahammedeah,
where are the magnificent remains of Udina.After about an hour's halt,
and when all the tents had been comfortably pitched, the Bey astonished
us with an order to continue our march, and we pursued our way to
Momakeeah, about thirty miles, which we did not reach until after dark.We passed, for some three or four hours, through a flight of locusts,
the air being darkened, and the ground loaded with them.At a little
distance, a flight of locusts has the appearance of a heavy snow-storm.These insects rarely visit the capital; but, since the appearance of
those near Momakeeah, they have been collected in the neighbourhood of
the city, cooked, and sold among the people.Momakeeah is a countryhouse
belonging to the Bey, to whom, also, belongs a great portion of the land
around.There is a large garden, laid out in the Italian style attached
to this country-seat.On arriving at Tunis, we called at the Bardo as we passed, and saw the
guard mounting.There was rather a fine band of military music; Moorish
musicians, but playing, after the European style, Italian and Moorish
airs.We must give here some account of our Boab's domestic concerns.He
boasted that he had had twenty-seven wives, his religion allowing four
at once, which he had bad several times; he was himself of somewhat
advanced years.According to him, if a man quarrels with his wife, he
can put her in prison, but must, at the same time, support her.A
certain quantity of provision is laid down by law, and he must give her
two suits, or changes, of clothes a year.But he must also visit her
once a week, and the day fixed is Friday.If the wife wishes to be
separated, and to return to her parents, she must first pay the money
which he may demand, and must also have his permission, although he
himself may send her to her parents whenever he chooses, without
assigning any reason.He retains the children, and he may marry again.The woman is generally expected to bring her husband a considerable sum
in the way of dowry, but, on separation, she gets nothing back.This was
the Boab's account, but I think he has overdone the harshness and
injustice of the Mohammedan law of marriage in relating it to our
tourists.It may be observed that the strict law is rarely acted upon,
and many respectable Moors have told me that they have but one wife, and
find that quite enough.It is true that many Moors, especially learned
men, divorce their wives when they get old, feeling the women an
embarrassment to them, and no wonder, when we consider these poor
creatures have no education, and, in their old age, neither afford
connubial pleasure nor society to their husbands.With respect to
divorce, a woman can demand by law and right to be separated from her
husband, or divorced, whenever he ill-treats her, or estranges himself
from her.Eunuchs, who have the charge of the women, are allowed to
marry, although they cannot have any family.The chief eunuch of the
Bardo has the most revolting countenance.Our tourists brought home a variety of curious Jereed things: small
date-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a
few live animals.Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents.Some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr.R. after his
return, and both Captain B. and Mr.R. have had every reason to be
extremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the "Bey
of the Camp."It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the
Jereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various
impediments.Our tourists say generally:--

  Camel-loads.[40]
  Money, dollars, and piastres, (chiefly I
  imagine, the latter.)23

  Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c.6

  Dates (these were collected at Toser,
    and brought from Nefta and the surrounding
    districts)                                     500
                                                  ----
                 Total                             529

  It is impossible, with this statement
    before us, to make out any exact
    calculation of the amount of tribute.A cantar of dates varies from fifteen
    to twenty-five shillings, say on an
    average a pound sterling; this will
    make the amount of the 500 camel-loads
    at five cantars per load                    L2,500

  Six camel-loads of woollen manufactures,
    &c., at sixty pound per load, value            360
                                                ------
                   Total                        L2,860

The money, chiefly piastres, must be left to conjecture.Levy, a large merchant at Tunis, thinks the amount might be from 150 to
200,000 piastres, or, taking the largest sum, L6,250 sterling:

  Total amount of the tribute of the Jereed:
  in goods                                      L2,860
  Ditto, in money:                               6,250
                                                ------
                   Total                        L9,110

To this sum may be added the smaller presents of horses, camels, and
other beasts of burden.*       *       *       *       *

Before leaving Mogador, in company with Mr.Willshire, I saw his
Excellency, the Governor again, when I took formal leave of him.He
accompanied me down to the port with several of the authorities, waiting
until I embarked for the Renshaw schooner.Several of the Consuls, and
nearly all the Europeans, were also present.On the whole, I was
satisfied with the civilities of the Moorish authorities, and offer my
cordial thanks to the Europeans of Mogador for their attentions during
my residence in that city.A little circumstance shews the subjection of our merchants, the Consul
not excepted, to the Moorish Government.One of the merchants wished to
accompany me on board, but was not permitted, on account of his
engagements with the Sultan.A merchant cannot even go off the harbour to superintend the stowing of
his goods.Never were prisoners of war, or political offenders, so
closely watched as the boasted imperial merchants of this city.After setting sail, we were soon out of sight of Mogador; and, on the
following day, land disappeared altogether.During the next month, we
were at sea, and out of view of the shore.I find an entry in my
journal, when off the Isle of Wight.We had had most tremendous weather,
successive gales of foul wind, from north and north-east.Our schooner
was a beautiful vessel, a fine sailer with a flat bottom, drawing little
water, made purposely for Barbary ports.She had her bows completely
under water, and pitched her way for twenty-five succeeding days,
through huge rising waves of sea and foam.During the whole of this
time, I never got up, and lived on bread and water with a little
biscuit.Captain Taylor, who was a capital seaman, and took the most
accurate observations, lost all patience, and, though a good methodist,
would now and then rush on deck, and swear at the perverse gale and
wrathful sea.We took on board a fine barb for Mr.Elton, which died
after a few days at sea, in these tempests.I had a young vulture that
died a day before the horse, or we should have fed him on the carcase.[Illustration]

An aoudad which we conveyed on account of Mr.Willshire to London, for
the Zoological Society, outlived these violent gales, and was safely and
comfortably lodged in the Regent's Park.After my return from Africa, I
paid my brave and hardy fellow-passenger a visit, and find the air of
smoky London agrees with him as well as the cloudless region of the
Morocco Desert.The following account of the bombardment of Mogador by the French,
written at the period by an English Resident may be of interest at the
present time.Mogador was bombarded on the 13th of August, 1844.Hostilities began at
9 o'clock A.M., by the Moors firing twenty-one guns before the French
had taken up their position, but the fire was not returned until 2 P.M.The 'Gemappes,' 100; 'Suffren,' 99; 'Triton,' 80; ships of the line.'Belle Poule,' 60, frigate; 'Asmodee' and 'Pluton,' steamers, and some
brigs, constituted the bombarding squadron.The batteries were silenced,
and the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving
the city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the
next morning, sacked and fired the city.On the 16th, nine hundred
French were landed on the isle of Mogador.After a rude encounter with
the garrison, they took possession of it and its forts.Their loss was,
after twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and
as many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle
killed, besides the casualties in the city.The British Consul and his wife, and Mr.Robertson, with
others, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on
account of their liabilities to the Emperor.The escape of these people
from destruction was most miraculous.The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,
'Warspite,' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and
preventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to
save, if possible, the British Consul's family and other detained
Europeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the
captain of the 'Warspite', nothing whatever could prevail upon the
Moorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the
British and other Europeans to take their departure.The Governor even
peremptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,
upon the cruel sophism that, "The Christian religion asserts the husband
and wife to be one, consequently," added the Governor, "as it is my
duty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving
Mogador, I must also keep his wife."The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,
thought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in
some way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the
city, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment.At any rate, they would
say, "Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves."During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their
best gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became
dispirited and abandoned the batteries.The Governor and his troops,
about sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly
all the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and
the European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to
defend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves
of famished wolves.As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the
French, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs.These
wretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages
around, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of
the most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,
assaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding
the more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in
the Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise
exposed.At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his
wife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians.Truly providential
was their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent
confusion and sanguinary violence.It was late when the plunderers
appeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by
hundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking
places for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their
rapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular
documents.Other gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and
others setting it on fire.It was a real pandemonium of discord and
licentiousness.During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it
was that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight
through the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding
band, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,
insisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her
throat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would
the ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul
having prudently resolved to take no money with them.Fortunately, at
this juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born
here, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force
to her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the
blood of their countrywomen.The chief of
the party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in
contact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which
the Consul's family got out of the town to a place of comparative
security.Incidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.Robertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms.Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.Robertson, with her infant and another child.Distracted by sad
forebodings, poor Mr.Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but
not before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a
sabre-blow at him to cut him down; but, as the murderous arm was poised
above, Mr.Robertson stooped, and, raising his arm at the time, warded
it off; the miscreant then rode off, being satisfied at this cut at the
detested Nazarene.Another ruffian seized one of his little girls, a pretty child of nine
years old, and scratched her arm several times with his dagger, calling
out _flous_ (money) at each stroke.Robertson
joined his fainting wife, and the British Consul and his wife, with Mr.An old Moor never deserted the Consul's family,
"faithful among the faithless;" and a Jewess, much attached to the
family, abandoned them only to return to those allied to her by the ties
of blood.Their situation was now still perilous, for, should they be discovered
by the wild Berbers, they all might be murdered.This night, the 15th,
was a most anxious one, and their apprehensions were dreadful.Dawn of
day was fast approaching, and every hour's delay rendered their
condition more precarious.Lucas, who never once
failed or lost his accustomed suavity and presence of mind amidst these
imminent dangers, resolved upon communicating with the fleet by a most
hazardous experiment.On his way from the town-gate to the water-port,
he noticed some deal planks near the beach.The idea struck him of
turning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their
party to communicate with the squadron.Lucas fetched the planks,
and resolutely set to work.Taking three of them, and luckily finding a
quantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and
with some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having
found two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly
launched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he
excited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat
came and took him on board.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the
batteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the
city, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the
rescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville
afterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.'The
self-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent
young man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the
British Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her
family were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews
and natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,
like many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and
a Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the
sack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,
and all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding
Prince, "Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,
and thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place
and this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of
all kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and
hardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,
coffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,
glass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.The exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,
oranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen
and sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish
slippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.

The value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856
was: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.The goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British
ports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.The following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships
that entered and cleared from this port during the same year.Entered:
British ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships
110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Cleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;
foreign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Three thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of
five dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in
conformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to
time, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors.In
addition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported
annually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying
from eight dollars to ten dollars per head.Gibraltar, also, draws from
this place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of
provisions.From the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country
produces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds
of various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and
goat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.The amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_.The imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded
the East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,
prints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,
drugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors
of small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that
of the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.The amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_.6_d_.,
foreign goods L31,222 11_s_.The trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand
for olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more
liberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.The principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different
qualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton
prints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,
earthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,
indigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,
and tin plate.The before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in
Rabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.The value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the
last five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.There can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would
greatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and
Government monopolies abolished.Large quantities of hides were exported
before they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is
very inconsiderable._Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw
cotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,
sugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very
small quantities.A small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,
but the major portions in the interior.The amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,
6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.No doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better
fiscal laws than those now established.But the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful
casting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.British masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly
Sardinian masters.THE END




[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a
peculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten
their once being sovereigns of Morocco.The _Moravedi_ were "really a
dynasty of priests," as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of
Cyrus.The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly
priests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to
be considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting
in themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the
_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.Abd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority
like the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet.Mankind have
always been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of
priests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the
Egyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most
accomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the
sovereigns of Egypt.[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr.Hay's "Western Barbary," (p.123), these words--"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young
girl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut
before the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!"This is an
unmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco.First of all,
the sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of
inhabitants in Barbary.Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,
unthought of.If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one
thing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of
human sacrifice.It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour
such an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen.It is true enough, at times,
oxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, "to appease an
offended potentate."One spring, when there was a great drought, the
people led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be
slaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the
Bey's frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her
Britannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,
two sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were
fired in their honour.The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during
his passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging
deep to appease its wild fury.But as to sacrificing human victims,
either to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the
place of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such
an enormity.It would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who
travelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,
had been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to
have scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention.But this
style of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a
case is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease
the wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in
amicable relations with ourselves.[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at
Morocco!)concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with
this strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--

"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom
we pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by
prolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and
giving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his
soul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united
with his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator.[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish
sergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the
disposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco.On
his death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, "nothing loath," into
the harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred
enclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.Here the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose
maxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, "My
empire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from
the gate of the palace to the gate of the city."To do Yezeed justice,
he followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the
world except the English (or Irish).Tully's Letters on Tripoli give a
graphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,
added a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.His father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate
his crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries
he passed through, by his terrific vagaries.One day he would cut off
the heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;
another day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,
and singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,
he would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a
razzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw.The
multitude sometimes implored heaven's blessing on the head of Yezeed.at
other times trembled for their own heads.Meanwhile, our European
consuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in
the West.So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage.So
the godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny.Marcus
Yarron reports, "that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,
Phoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians."[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so
called by the Greeks from their dark complexions.[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying
land, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the
cultivable lands to the South.To give the term more force it is
doubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication.De Haedo de la
Captividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,
who proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros.He says--"Moors, Alartes,
Cabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,
indomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the
last few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of
Barbary."[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib.[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to
steal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves.Others, and with more
probability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,
and others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a
pastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the
new Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means "great," and the tribes thus
distinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase
"la grande nation."The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended
from the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of
Palestine.In his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris
(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a
note--

"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are
Zeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we
name Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.Huroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,
but not so distinguished.La de Ketama was, according to tradition,
African, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio."Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the
Assyrians, to the land of the west."None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,
their historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other
aboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the
Getules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula.But the present
Berbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people
just mentioned.In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria
the Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara
the Touarichs.There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures
of these tribes."[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best
authority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most
celebrated mountain system, called by him "Systeme Atlantique," and I
shall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,
"Orographie."He says--"Of the 'Systeme Atlantique,' which derives its
name from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so
little known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the
region of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well
as the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert.It appears
that the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape
Noun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the
State of Tripoli.In this vast space it crosses the new State of
Sidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as
well as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis.It is in the
Empire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,
and in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest
heights of the whole system.It goes on diminishing afterwards in height
as it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the
territory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,
and the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of
Tripoli.Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from
the principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the
Strait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco.Several intermediary
mountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which
intersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis.Geographers call Little
Atlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the
name of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of
Morocco.In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in
the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the
names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount
Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the
Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper.From observations made on the spot by
Mr.Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which
several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of
Great Atlas does not exist.The inhabitants of Mediah who were
questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that
the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less
elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of
mountains to cross.The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to
Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of
the Regency.[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being
run down by fleet horses.[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,
its name amongst the modern aborigines.This word has been compared to
the Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if
Mount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the
globe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce
and glorious splendour.Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew
meaning 'great' or'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to
the Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people.We
have, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the
Moors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and
_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,
the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.Any way, the modern
Der-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the
registers of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and
most governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the
numbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,
wholly, or in part.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty
years uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have
finally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron
lay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once
merchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a
schooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels
were said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the
rock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable
toll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever
since been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on
European navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage
in war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and
active friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess
ourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in
the neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be
of Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when
commerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually
written by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal
palace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of
Silda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense
quantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of
that name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who
always speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the
whole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the
court of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less
authentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the
Escurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,
and by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations
is generally used for the other.The same Casiri says, with regard to
Fez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of
Almansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does
not perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism.Fez was already a
very ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and
Joseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum
speaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an
example for No Ammon.He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,
Fut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French
march an army into Fez, and sack the library.[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the
novelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great
noise among them.The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,
and threatened to "rip open my bowels" if I went down there.[29] The Sultan's Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the
question says, "Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul
free from the fire," (hell), quoting the Koran.[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace
at court, for a present corresponds to our "good morning."[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes.[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.[33] Bismilla, Arabic for "In the name of God!"the Mohammedan grace
before meat, and also drink.[34] Shaw says.--"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon
the little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.The body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with
little brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,
with each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are
whitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is
attacked.The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a
half long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe
with the bustard's, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that
bird being twice as big as the hobara.Nothing can be more entertaining
than to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights
and stratagems it makes use of to escape."The French call the hobara, a
little bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl.They are
frequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat
something like pheasant, and their flesh is red.[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the
Belvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately
over the Marsa road.Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you
have the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view
of sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole
Regency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa.There are besides
many lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the
craggy heights of the south-east.But these are little frequented by the
European residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative
that the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in
their lives.Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,
not with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most
offensive smell.[36] Shaw says: "The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious
bird, which wanteth the hinder toe.There are two species, and both
about and a little larger than the ordinary pullet.The belly of both is
white, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter
and marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs
stronger than the partridge.The name rhaad, "thunder," is given to it
from the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its
beating the air, a sound imitating the motion."[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew "comprimere,"
is an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan
Hercules.It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of
Jugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the
midst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by
snakes and serpents.Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all
the inhabitants to the sword.The modern city is built on a gentle
eminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the
materials of the ancient one.Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or
rather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,
containing a small garrison.This place may be called the gate of the
Tunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now
to disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the
cultivation of corn.Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,
El-Kesir, and El-Ghetar.A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit
their grain in Ghafsa.This town is famous for its manufactories of
baraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers.There is
also a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth
by a very rude process.The environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the
pomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the
olive-tree.The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is
exported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.[38] Kaemtz's Meteorology, p.[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of
wheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat.It is most
nutritive, and is eaten with or without meat and vegetables.When the
grains are large, it is called hamza.[40] A camel-load is about five cantars, and a cantar is a hundred
weight.[Transcriber's Note: In this electronic edition, the footnotes were

another look to the time-worn tombstone, another sigh to the early doom
of those whom it enclosed, and then, with a feeling of regret, again left
the little island to its still, unshared, and pensive loneliness.ANCIENT IRISH LITERATURE--No.The composition which we have selected as our fourth specimen of the
ancient literature of Ireland, is a poem, more remarkable, perhaps,
for its antiquity and historical interest, than for its poetic merits,
though we do not think it altogether deficient in those.It is ascribed,
apparently with truth, to the celebrated poet Mac Liag, the secretary of
the renowned monarch Brian Boru, who, as our readers are aware, fell at
the battle of Clontarf in 1014; and the subject of it is a lamentation
for the fallen condition of Kincora, the palace of that monarch,
consequent on his death.The decease of Mac Liag, whose proper name was Muircheartach, is thus
recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 1015:--

“Mac Liag, i. e. Muirkeartach, son of Conkeartach, at this time laureate
of Ireland, died.”

A great number of his productions are still in existence; but none of
them have obtained a popularity so widely extended as the poem before us.Of the palace of Kincora, which was situated on the banks of the Shannon,
near Killaloe, there are at present no vestiges.LAMENTATION OF MAC LIAG FOR KINCORA.A Chinn-copath carthi Brian?And where is the beauty that once was thine?Oh, where are the princes and nobles that sate
    At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine?Oh, where are the Dalcassians of the Golden Swords?[1]
    And where are the warriors that Brian led on?And where is Morogh, the descendant of kings--
    The defeater of a hundred--the daringly brave--
    Who set but slight store by jewels and rings--
    Who swam down the torrent and laughed at its wave?And where is Donogh, King Brian’s worthy son?And where is Conaing, the Beautiful Chief?they are gone--
    They have left me this night alone with my grief!And where are the chiefs with whom Brian went forth,
    The never-vanquished son of Evin the Brave,
    The great King of Onaght, renowned for his worth,
    And the hosts of Baskinn, from the western wave?Oh, where is Duvlann of the Swiftfooted Steeds?And where is Kian, who was son of Molloy?And where is King Lonergan, the fame of whose deeds
    In the red battle-field no time can destroy?And where is that youth of majestic height,
    The faith-keeping Prince of the Scots?--Even he,
    As wide as his fame was, as great as was his might,
    Was tributary, oh, Kincora, to me!They are gone, those heroes of royal birth,
    Who plundered no churches, and broke no trust,
    ’Tis weary for me to be living on the earth
    When they, oh, Kincora, lie low in the dust!Oh, never again will Princes appear,
    To rival the Dalcassians of the Cleaving Swords!I can never dream of meeting afar or anear,
    In the east or the west, such heroes and lords!Oh, dear are the images my memory calls up
    Of Brian Boru!--how he never would miss
    To give me at the banquet the first bright cup!why did he heap on me honour like this?I am Mac Liag, and my home is on the Lake:
    Thither often, to that palace whose beauty is fled,
    Came Brian to ask me, and I went for his sake.that I should live, and Brian be dead![1] _Coolg n-or_, of the swords _of gold_, i. e. of the _gold-hilted_
swords.“Biography of a mouse!” cries the reader; “well, what shall we have
next?--what can the writer mean by offering such nonsense for our
perusal?” There is no creature, reader, however insignificant and
unimportant in the great scale of creation it may appear to us,
short-sighted mortals that we are, which is forgotten in the care of
our own common Creator; not a sparrow falls to the ground unknown and
unpermitted by Him; and whether or not you may derive interest from the
biography even of a mouse, you will be able to form a better judgment,
after, than before, having read my paper.The mouse belongs to the class _Mammalia_, or the animals which rear
their young by suckling them; to the order _Rodentia_, or animals whose
teeth are adapted for _gnawing_; to the genus _Mus_, or Rat kind, and the
family of _Mus musculus_, or domestic mouse.The mouse is a singularly
beautiful little animal, as no one who examines it attentively, and
without prejudice, can fail to discover.Its little body is plump and
sleek; its neck short; its head tapering and graceful; and its eyes
large, prominent, and sparkling.Its manners are lively and interesting,
its agility surprising, and its habits extremely cleanly.There are
several varieties of this little creature, amongst which the best known
is the common brown mouse of our granaries and store-rooms; the Albino,
or white mouse, with red eyes; and the black and white mouse, which is
more rare and very delicate.I mention these as _varieties_, for I think
we may safely regard them as such, from the fact of their propagating
unchanged, preserving their difference of hue to the fiftieth generation,
and never accidentally occurring amongst the offspring of differently
 parents.It is of the white mouse that I am now about to treat, and it is an
account of a tame individual of that extremely pretty variety that is
designed to form the subject of my present paper.When I was a boy of about sixteen, I got possession of a white mouse; the
little creature was very wild and unsocial at first, but by dint of care
and discipline I succeeded in rendering it familiar.The principal agent
I employed towards effecting its domestication was a singular one, and
which, though I can assure the reader its effects are speedy and certain,
still remains to me inexplicable: this was, ducking in cold water; and by
resorting to this simple expedient, I have since succeeded in rendering
even the rat as tame and as playful as a kitten.It is out of my power to
explain the manner in which _ducking_ operates on the animal subjected to
it, but I wish that some physiologist more experienced than I am would
give his attention to the subject, and favour the public with the result
of his reflections.At the time that I obtained possession of this mouse, I was residing at
Olney, in Buckinghamshire, a village which I presume my readers will
recollect as connected with the names of Newton and Cowper; but shortly
after having succeeded in rendering it pretty tame, circumstances
required my removal to Gloucester, whither I carried my little favourite
with me.During the journey I kept the mouse confined in a small wire
cage; but while resting at the inn where I passed the night, I adopted
the precaution of enveloping the cage in a handkerchief, lest by some
untoward circumstance its active little inmate might make its escape.Having thus, as I thought, made all safe, I retired to rest.The moment
I awoke in the morning, I sprang from my bed, and went to examine the
cage, when, to my infinite consternation, I found it empty!I searched
the bed, the room, raised the carpet, examined every nook and corner, but
all to no purpose.I dressed myself as hastily as I could, and summoning
one of the waiters, an intelligent, good-natured man, I informed
him of my loss, and got him to search every room in the house.His
investigations, however, proved equally unavailing, and I gave my poor
little pet completely up, inwardly hoping, despite of its ingratitude
in leaving me, that it might meet with some agreeable mate amongst its
brown congeners, and might lead a long and happy life, unchequered by
the terrors of the prowling cat, and unendangered by the more insidious
artifices of the fatal trap.With these reflections I was just getting
into the coach which was to convey me upon my road, when a waiter came
running to the door, out of breath, exclaiming, “Mr R., Mr R., I declare
your little mouse is in the kitchen.” Begging the coachman to wait an
instant, I followed the man to the kitchen, and there, on the hob,
seated contentedly in a pudding dish, and devouring its contents with
considerable _gout_, was my truant protegé.Once more secured within
its cage, and the latter carefully enveloped in a sheet of strong brown
paper, upon my knee, I reached Gloucester.I was here soon subjected to a similar alarm, for one morning the cage
was again empty, and my efforts to discover the retreat of the wanderer
unavailing as before.This time I had lost him for a week, when one
night, in getting into bed, I heard a scrambling in the curtains, and on
relighting my candle found the noise to have been occasioned by my mouse,
who seemed equally pleased with myself at our reunion.After having thus
lost and found my little friend a number of times, I gave up the idea
of confining him; and, accordingly, leaving the door of his cage open,
I placed it in a corner of my bedroom, and allowed him to go in and out
as he pleased.Of this permission he gladly availed himself, but would
regularly return to me at intervals of a week or a fortnight, and at such
periods of return he was usually much thinner than ordinary; and it was
pretty clear that during his visits to his brown acquaintances he fared
by no means so well as he did at home.Sometimes, when he happened to return, as he often did, in the
night-time, on which occasions his general custom was to come into bed to
me, I used, in order to induce him to remain with me until morning, to
immerse him in a basin of water, and then let him lie in my bosom, the
warmth of which, after his cold bath, commonly ensured his stay.Frequently, while absent on one of his excursions, I would hear an
unusual noise in the wainscot, as I lay in bed, of dozens of mice
running backwards and forwards in all directions, and squeaking in much
apparent glee.For some time I was puzzled to know whether this unusual
disturbance was the result of merriment or quarrelling, and I often
trembled for the safety of my pet, alone and unaided, among so many
strangers.But a very interesting circumstance occurred one morning,
which perfectly reassured me.It was a bright summer morning, about four
o’clock, and I was lying awake, reflecting as to the propriety of turning
on my pillow to take another sleep, or at once rising, and going forth to
enjoy the beauties of awakening nature.While thus meditating, I heard a
slight scratching in the wainscot, and looking towards the spot whence
the noise proceeded, perceived the head of a mouse peering from a hole.It was instantly withdrawn, but a second was thrust forth.This latter I
at once recognised as my own white friend, but so begrimed by soot and
dirt that it required an experienced eye to distinguish him from his
darker-coated entertainers.He emerged from the hole, and running over
to his cage, entered it, and remained for a couple of seconds within
it; he then returned to the wainscot, and, re-entering the hole, some
scrambling and squeaking took place.A second time he came forth, and on
this occasion was followed closely, to my no small astonishment, by a
brown mouse, who followed him, with much apparent timidity and caution,
to his box, and entered it along with him.More astonished at this
singular proceeding than I can well express, I lay fixed in mute and
breathless attention, to see what would follow next.In about a minute
the two mice came forth from the cage, each bearing in its mouth a large
piece of bread, which they dragged towards the hole they had previously
left.On arriving at it, they entered, but speedily re-appeared, having
deposited their burden; and repairing once more to the cage, again loaded
themselves with provision, and conveyed it away.This second time they
remained within the hole for a much longer period than the first time;
and when they again made their appearance, they were attended by three
other mice, who, following their leaders to the cage, loaded themselves
with bread as did they, and carried away their burdens to the hole.After
this I saw them no more that morning, and on rising I discovered that
they had carried away every particle of food that the cage contained.Nor
was this an isolated instance of their white guest leading them forth to
where he knew they should find provender.Day after day, whatever bread
or grain I left in the cage was regularly removed, and the duration of my
pet’s absence was proportionately long.Wishing to learn whether hunger
was the actual cause of his return, I no longer left food in his box; and
in about a week afterwards, on awaking one morning, I found him sleeping
upon the pillow, close to my face, having partly wormed his way under my
cheek.There was a cat in the house, an excellent mouser, and I dreaded lest she
should one day meet with and destroy my poor mouse, and I accordingly
used all my exertions with those in whose power it was, to obtain her
dismissal.She was, however, regarded by those persons as infinitely
better entitled to protection and patronage than a mouse, so I was
compelled to put up with her presence.People are fond of imputing to
cats a supernatural degree of sagacity: they will sometimes go so far
as to pronounce them to be genuine _witches_; and really I am scarcely
surprised at it, nor perhaps will the reader be, when I tell him the
following anecdote.I was one day entering my apartment, when I was filled with horror at
perceiving my mouse picking up some crumbs upon the carpet, beneath
the table, and the terrible cat seated upon a chair watching him with
what appeared to me to be an expression of sensual anticipation and
concentrated desire.Before I had time to interfere, Puss sprang from
her chair, and bounded towards the mouse, who, however, far from being
terrified at the approach of his natural enemy, scarcely so much as
favoured her with a single look.Puss raised her paw and dealt him a
gentle tap, when, judge of my astonishment if you can, the little mouse,
far from running away, or betraying any marks of fear, raised himself
on his legs, cocked his tail, and with a shrill and angry squeak, with
which any that have kept tame mice are well acquainted, sprang at and
positively _bit_ the paw which had struck him.I could
not jump forward to the rescue.I was, as it were, petrified where I
stood.But, stranger than all, the cat, instead of appearing irritated,
or seeming to design mischief, merely stretched out her nose and smelt
at her diminutive assailant, and then resuming her place upon the chair,
purred herself to sleep.I need not say that I immediately secured the
mouse within his cage.Whether the cat on this occasion knew the little
animal to be a pet, and as such feared to meddle with it, or whether its
boldness had disarmed her, I cannot pretend to explain: I merely state
the fact; and I think the reader will allow that it is sufficiently
extraordinary.In order to guard against such a dangerous encounter for the future,
I got a more secure cage made, of which the bars were so close as to
preclude the possibility of egress; and singularly enough, many a morning
was I amused by beholding brown mice coming from their holes in the
wainscot, and approaching the cage in which their friend was kept, as if
in order to condole with him on the subject of his unwonted captivity.Secure, however, as I conceived this new cage to be, my industrious pet
contrived to make his escape from it, and in doing so met his death.In
my room was a large bureau, with deep, old-fashioned, capacious drawers.Being obliged to go from home for a day, I put the cage containing my
little friend into one of these drawers, lest any one should attempt to
meddle with it during my absence.On returning, I opened the drawer,
and just as I did so, heard a faint squeak, and at the same instant my
poor little pet fell from the back of the drawer--lifeless.I took up
his body, and, placing it in my bosom, did my best to restore it to
animation.His little body had been crushed
in the crevice at the back part of the drawer, through which he had been
endeavouring to escape, and he was really and irrecoverably gone.*       *       *       *       *

NOTE ON THE FEEDING, &C., OF WHITE MICE.--Such of my juvenile readers
as may be disposed to make a pet of one of these interesting little
animals, would do well to observe the following rules:--Clean the cage
out daily, and keep it dry; do not keep it in too cold a place; in
winter it should be kept in a room in which there is a fire.Feed the
mice on bread steeped in milk, having first squeezed the milk out, as
too moist food is bad for them.Never give them cheese, as it is apt to
produce fatal disorders, though the more hardy brown mice eat it with
impunity.If you want to give them a treat, give them grains of wheat
or barley, or if these are not to be procured, oats or rice.A little
tin box of water should be constantly left in their cage, but securely
fixed, so that they cannot overturn it.Let the wires be not too slight,
or too long, otherwise the little animals will easily squeeze themselves
between them, and let them be of iron, never of copper, as the animals
are fond of nibbling at them, and the rust of the latter, or _verdigris_,
would quickly poison them.White mice are to be procured at most of the
bird-shops in Patrick’s Close, Dublin; of the wire-workers and bird-cage
makers in Edinburgh; and from all the animal fanciers in London,
whose residences are to be found chiefly on the New Road and about
Knightsbridge.Their prices vary from one shilling to two-and-sixpence
per pair, according to their age and beauty.H. D. R.




THE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would
all utter the one cry, “we are overstocked;” and echo would reply
“overstocked.” This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody
seems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own
part--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is
loudest in exclaiming “dear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep
here!” never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own
person from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from
the utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already
in the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many “vanities and vexations of spirit” under the sun, but this
evil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to
no purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the “excess”
from applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are
the primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the
loss.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be
owing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it
strikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people
pay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of
blanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;
but in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is
nothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the
envy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared
with the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to
enjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a
provision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general
education, professional education, and then of admission to “liberty to
practise;” and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,
they conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost
them “thus much monies.” But unfortunately they soon learn by experience
that the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always
possess that homely recommendation of causing the “pot to boil,” and that
the individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so
soon left to shift for himself.Here then is another cause of this evil,
namely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a
certain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these “piping
times of peace,” a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to
verify the old song, and

    “Spend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,”

as an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation
monies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et
ceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any
comfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other
source, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the
hands of the paymaster.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,
and of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by
circumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.Yet the
mistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently
admitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.The usual
result is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,
after incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is
obliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the
unprofitable profession of arms.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other
professions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of
the bar, that “many are called but few are chosen;” but with very few and
rare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however
small, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and
connections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his
mind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from
day to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,
without any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast
proportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so
constantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.The question
is, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an
overstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to
enter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no
unnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty’s
subjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain
situations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable
channels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal
profession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can
afford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to
bear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such
it is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they
think proper.But it will be asked, what is to
be done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,
if this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably
spent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive
pursuits, would insure them a “good location” and a certain provision
for life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable
occupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to
“professions” which, however “liberal,” hold out to the many but a very
doubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among
certain of my countrymen that “trade” is not a “genteel” thing, and
that it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes
also, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of
which we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high
classical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our
schools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a
matter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,
as surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.Thus the evil is
nourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising
those parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in
the professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their
children, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less
elegant but more useful accomplishment of “ciphering.” I am disposed to
concur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the
inestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,
in our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every
thing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly
recommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is
no encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there
were, there would be no necessity for me to recommend “ciphering” and
its virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers
its prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who
wait for a “highway” to be made for them.If people were resolved to
live by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,
than at present operate successfully in that department.If more of
education, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources
of profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover
themselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter
further into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint
which may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small
farmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it
is.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to
Christmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to
which they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear
to offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and
accommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of
poultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to
the rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor
Irish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth
while to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having
ascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great
decrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one
individual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas
and Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that
another dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as
many: these they purchase in lots from the farmers’ wives.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to
some of the readers of this Journal:--

The farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent
of suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the
fertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a
higher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number
of goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all
casualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on
which, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,
as it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;
and this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with
stimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,
twenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after
bringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the
birds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three
shillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,
on which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,
generally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or
larger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in
order to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if
with reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be
superfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various
works on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the
practice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great
dealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,
and condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio
of one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to
cleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened
in about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,
described by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of
blinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated
casks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),
are happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,
with one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal
proofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese
brought into the London markets: these, however, may possibly be imported
ones, though I fear they are not so.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets
of barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their
geese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,
besides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and
rather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the
vast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year
for the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which
gives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this
business, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural
countrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the
stock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,
and in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or
feed on the stubbles.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be
less frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when
the geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the
cramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This
opinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which
leads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when
they are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,
and that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give
them, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of
condition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.Mr Cobbett
used to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,
carrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as
farinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience
of such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory
and conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of
potatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not
if it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of
cramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general
disinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese
alive.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three
times in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation
twice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,
the geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the
birds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the
pluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.But as birds do not moult three
times in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said
that the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature
suggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great
numbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground
would be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be
justified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,
we have many recorded facts; among them the following:--“In 1824 there
was a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near
Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It
had been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson’s
forefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer
it to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the
in-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on
the spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.”

The taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a
goose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause
its enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high
and forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well
known; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in
producing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for
geese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it
would appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but
in another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--“The production of
flesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for
example, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the
activity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed
into fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress
of respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions
necessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in
quadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an
excessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of
the animal.”

We are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for
the market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of
geese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be
the chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many
parts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our
agricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese
in localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of
conversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the
public mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also
hope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish
manufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to
those of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be
deemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;
and, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce
for themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get “the London
stamp” upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the
case of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures
are rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to
our knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually
at the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many
of those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into
“Ould Ireland,” and are bought as English by those who would despise
them as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in
this way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and
in like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,
without waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity
for such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists
equally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so
highly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them
by wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the
favour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we
may refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor
has been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of
_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled “A
short chapter on Bustles,” but which he gives as written for the said
Court Gazette!Now, this is really very considerate and complimentary,
and we of course feel grateful.But, better again, we find our able and
kind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no
doubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks
ago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,
but as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court
Gazette.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to
consider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own
Journal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the
consistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the
cause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be
compatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?*       *       *       *       *

    Printed and published every Saturday by GUNN and CAMERON, at
    the Office of the General Advertiser, No.6, Church Lane,
    College Green, Dublin.--Sold by all Booksellers.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Irish Penny Journal, Vol.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people."He will come around all right," said Tompkins.Down with the city officials; let's
throw them into the Ohio," and with frightful cries, the mob started for
the city hall.But the brave, loyal policeman, G. A. Green, the one who had assisted
Fred, was before them."Stop," he cried, "the first man who tries to
enter this building dies."With a curse, Tompkins rushed on with the cry, "Down with the
Lincolnites!"There was the sharp crack of a revolver, and Tompkins staggered and fell
dead.Before they could rally there
stood around the brave policeman a company of armed men.This was not
all; as if by magic, armed Home Guards appeared everywhere.Then a prominent officer of the Home Guard came forward
and said:

"We do not wish to shed more blood, but the first blow struck at the
city government, and these streets will run red with the blood of
Secessionists.Cowed, muttering, cursing, the mob began to melt away.The sun went down on one of the most exciting days Louisville
ever saw--a day that those who were there will never forget.The city was saved to the Union, and never afterward was it in grave
danger.Spear, to whom Fred had been relating
his experience."Hardly that," replied Fred, blushing."I am so glad it has ended well," continued Mrs.Spear; "you ran a
terrible danger, and I should never have forgiven myself for letting you
go out, if any evil had befallen you.""I should never have forgiven myself if I had not been there to protect
that brave young lady," answered Fred, firmly."Of course, a true knight must protect a fair lady," said Mrs."And you were fortunate, Sir Knight, for Mabel Vaughn is one of the
fairest of Louisville's daughters.It was just like her to brave any
danger rather than conceal her colors."She seems to be a very nice young lady," replied Fred, "and she is
extremely pretty, too.""What a pity you are not older," said Mrs.Spear, "so you could fall in
love with each other and get married, just as they do in well-regulated
novels.""How do you know that I am not in love with her now?"answered Fred, his
eyes sparkling with merriment; "and as for my youth, I will grow."in that case, I am really sorry," replied Mrs.Spear, "for I think
she is spoken for."Fred assumed a tragic air, and said in bloodcurdling tones: "Where was
the recreant lover that he did not protect her?Never shall my good
sword rest until it drinks his craven blood.""You will call on your lady love
before you return?""Most assuredly, and it must be an early morning call, for I leave for
home at ten o'clock."The warmth of welcome given Fred by the Vaughns surprised him, and, to
his astonishment, he found himself a hero in their eyes.Miss Mabel Vaughn was a most charming young lady of eighteen, and when
she grasped Fred's hand, and, with tears in her eyes, poured out her
thanks, he felt a curious sensation about his heart, and as he looked
into her beautiful face, he could not help echoing the wish of Mrs.Spear, "Oh, that I were older."But this fancy received a rude shock when a fine looking young man,
introduced as Mr.Robert Marsden, grasped his hand, and thanked him for
what he had done for his betrothed."And to think," said Marsden, "that Mabel was in danger, and that you,
instead of me, protected her, makes me insanely envious of you.""As for that, Bob," archly said Miss Mabel, "I am glad you were not
there.Shackelford did far better than you would have
done."Seeing he looked hurt, Miss Vaughn
continued: "I mean you would have been so rash you might have been
killed.""Which would have been far worse than if I had been killed," said Fred,
meekly.I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that!"cried Miss Vaughn,
bursting into tears."Which means I ought to be kicked for uttering a silly joke," answered
Fred, greatly distressed."Please, Miss Vaughn, let us change the
subject.How did you happen to be on the street?""I had been calling on a sick friend a few doors away, and I thought I
could reach home in safety during the few moments of quiet.My friend
wanted me to remove the little flag from the bosom of my dress before I
ventured out, but I refused, saying, 'I would never conceal my colors,'
and I was caught in the mob, as you saw.""And I shall consider it the happiest day of my life I was there,"
gallantly answered Fred."And we must not forget the brave policeman.""That I will not," replied Miss Vaughn."There is one good thing it has brought about, anyway," said Marsden."Mabel has at length consented that I shall enter the army.I shall wear this little flag that she
wore yesterday on my breast, and it will ever be an incentive to deeds
of glory, and it shall never be disgraced," and the young man's eyes
kindled as he said it.Had a shadow of the future floated before her?Months afterward that
little flag was returned to her bloodstained and torn.Vaughn, "this will never do, rather let us
rejoice that we are all alive and happy this morning.Two or three lively airs dispelled all the clouds, and Fred took his
leave with the promise that he would never come to Louisville without
calling.Fred's return to Nicholasville was without adventure.He wondered what
had become of Captain Conway, and laughed when he imagined the meeting
between the captain and Major Hockoday.He found Prince none the worse
for his fast riding, and jumping gaily on his back, started for home,
returning by way of Camp Dick Robinson.Here he met Lieutenant Nelson,
who warmly grasped his hand, and thanked him for his services in
delivering his message."But," continued Nelson, "I have heard rumors of your performing a still
more important part, and securing papers of the greatest value to us.When Fred related his meeting with Major Hockoday and Morgan, and how
he had wrung the dispatch from Captain Conway, Nelson nearly went into
an apoplectic fit from laughter.Then he stood up and looked at the boy
admiringly."Fred," he said, "you have done what one man in a hundred thousand could
not have done.Not only this; but if
you will enter my service, not as a spy, but as a special messenger and
scout, I will see that you are enrolled as such with good pay.""You must remember, sir, I am but a boy still under
the control of my father.I accepted the mission from you, which I did,
on the impulse of the moment; and I fear when I return home, I shall
find my father very much offended."My mother died but a few weeks ago, and since her death
father has taken no interest in the events going on around him.I have
never heard him express any opinion since the war really began.Before
that he was in hopes it could be settled peaceably.""Well, my boy, whatever happens, remember you have a friend in me.Not
only this, but if you can arrange it amicably with your father, I may
call on you, if at any time I have a very delicate mission I wish to
have performed."Fred thanked him, and rode on to his home.He found his father in very
earnest conversation with his uncle, Judge Pennington, and Colonel
Humphrey Marshall, a well-known Kentuckian.The trio were earnestly
discussing the war, Judge Pennington and Colonel Marshall trying to
convince Mr.Shackelford that it was his duty to come out boldly for the
South, instead of occupying his position of indifference.Shackelford saw Fred, he excused himself a moment, and calling
him, said: "Where in the world have you been, Fred?I thought you were
with your Cousin Calhoun, and therefore borrowed no trouble on account
of your absence.But when your uncle came a few moments ago, and
informed me you had not been there for three days, I became greatly
alarmed, and as soon as I could dismiss my visitors I was going to
institute a search for you.""I am all right, father," answered Fred.I
will tell you all about it when you are at leisure."Shackelford, and went back and resumed the
conversation with his guests.In the evening, when father and son were alone, Fred told where he had
been, and who sent him.Shackelford looked grave, and said:

"Fred, this is a bad business.Since the death of your mother, I have
taken but little interest in passing events.I have just awakened to the
fact that there is a great war in progress.""Yes, father," said Fred in a low tone, "war on the old flag.Shackelford did not answer for a moment, and then he said, with a
troubled countenance: "I had almost as soon lose my right arm as to
raise it against the flag for which my fathers fought.On the other
side, how can I, a man Southern born, raise my hand against my kindred?Kentucky is a sovereign State; as such she has resolved to be neutral.The South is observing this neutrality, the North is not.Even now the
Federal government is raising and arming troops right in our midst.This
Lieutenant Nelson, to whom you have rendered such valuable services, is
foremost in this defiance of the wishes of Kentucky.The raising and
arming of Federal troops must be stopped, or the whole State will be in
the throes of a fratricidal strife.Your uncle and Colonel Marshall are
for Kentucky's seceding and joining the South.For this I am not
prepared, for it would make the State the battleground of the contending
armies.Let me hear no
more of your aiding Nelson, or you are no son of mine.""Father, you say Kentucky is a sovereign State.Is it right then for
those who favor the South to try and force Kentucky into the Southern
Confederacy against the will of a majority of her people?"Shackelford hesitated, and then said: "As much right as the
Unionists have to force her to stay in.But I do not ask you to aid the
South, neither must you aid Nelson."Shackelford drew a deep sigh, and then continued: "Your mother
being a Northern woman, I suppose you have imbibed some of her peculiar
ideas.Under the circumstances, Fred thought it best not to say anything about
his adventure with Captain Conway, or what happened in Louisville.But
he readily promised his father he would do nothing to aid either side
without consulting him.Shackelford, "this business being settled, I have
another matter I wish to talk about.My business is in such shape it is
of the utmost importance that I get some papers to your Uncle Charles in
Nashville for him to sign.Mail, you know, is now prohibited between the
two sections.To travel between the two States is becoming nearly
impossible.Even now, the journey may
be attended with great danger; and I would not think of asking you if it
was not so important for your Uncle Charles to sign the papers.But as
much as I would like to have you make the journey, I shall not command
you, but let you exercise your own pleasure."shouted Fred, his boyish enthusiasm and love of
adventure aroused.You know a spice of danger adds
enjoyment to one's journey.""Well," said his father, "it is all settled, then, but be very careful,
for they tell me the whole country is in a state of fearful ferment.One thing more, Fred; if you have any Union sentiment, suppress it
entirely while you are gone.It will not do in Middle Tennessee; there
are no Union men there."The next morning, after kissing his little sister good-bye, and
promising his father to be very careful, Fred started on his journey.Nashville was about one hundred and sixty miles away, and he calculated
he could reach it in three days.From Danville he took the main road to
Liberty, thence to Columbia, where he stopped for the night.His next
day's ride took him to Glasgow, then south to Scottsville.He found the
whole country in a state of the greatest excitement; and passed numerous
companies of Kentuckians going south to join the Confederate army.After
leaving Columbia, he saw nothing but the Confederate flag displayed.If
there were any Unionists, they did not let the fact be known.Just over on the Tennessee side, as he passed into that State, was a
large encampment of Confederate troops; and Fred was repeatedly asked to
enlist, while many a covetous eye was cast on his horse.It was
afternoon before he reached Gallatin, where he stopped for refreshments
for himself and horse.He found the little city a perfect hotbed of excitement.The people were
still rejoicing over the victory at Bull Run, and looking every day for
Washington to fall.To them the war was nearly over, and there was joy
on every countenance.When it became known at the hotel that Fred was
from Kentucky, he was surrounded by an eager crowd to learn the news
from that State.In reply to his eager questioners, Fred said:

"Gentlemen, I do not know that I can give you anything new.You know
that Kentucky has voted to remain neutral, but that does not prevent our
people from being pretty evenly divided.Many of our most prominent men
are advocating the cause of the South, but as yet they have failed to
overcome the Union sentiment.The day after the battle of Bull Run there
was a riot in Louisville, and it was thought that the friends of the
South might be able to seize the city government, but the movement
failed.""You are all right in that section of the country, are you not?""On the contrary," replied Fred, "a Lieutenant Nelson has organized a
camp at Dick Robinson, but a few miles from where I live, and is engaged
in raising ten regiments of Kentucky troops for the Federal army."The news was astounding, and a murmur of surprise ran through the crowd,
which became a burst of indignation, and a big red-faced man shouted:

"It's a lie, youngster; Kentuckians are not all cowards and
Abolitionists.You are nothing but a Lincolnite in disguise."You are right," said Fred, advancing on the man, "when you say all
Kentuckians are not cowards.Some of them still have courage to resent
an insult, especially when it is offered by a cur," and he dealt the man
a blow across the face with his riding-whip with such force as to leave
an angry, red mark.The man howled with pain and rage, and attempted to draw a revolver, but
stout hands laid hold of him, and he was dragged blaspheming away.Meanwhile it looked as if there might be a riot.Some were hurrahing for
the boy; others were shaking their heads and demanding that Fred further
give an account of himself.He had been called a Lincolnite, and that
was enough to damn him in the eyes of many.cried a commanding looking young man,
dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant of the Confederate army, pushing
his way through the crowd."Oh, this hyear young feller struck Bill Pearson across the face with
his ridin'-whip for callin' him a Lincolnite and a liah," volunteered a
seedy, lank looking individual."Which seems full enough provocation for a blow.Bill is fortunate he
hasn't got a hole through him," responded the young lieutenant."But maybe he is a Lincolnite," persisted the seedy individual."He
said Kentuck wouldn't 'cede, and that they was raisin' sogers to help
whip we 'uns.""Who are
you, and where did you come from?"Fred explained what had happened; how he had been asked for news from
Kentucky, and that he had told them only the truth.He then gave his
name, and said he was on his way to Nashville to visit his uncle,
Charles Shackelford."Fellow-citizens," said the young officer in a voice that at once
commanded attention, "this young man informs me that he is a nephew of
Major Charles Shackelford of Nashville, who is now engaged in raising a
regiment for the Confederate service.No nephew of his can be a
Lincolnite.As for the news he told, unfortunately
it's true.Kentucky, although thousands of her gallant sons have joined
us, still clings to her neutrality, or is openly hostile to us.It is
true, that a renegade Kentuckian by the name of Nelson is enlisting
troops for the Yankees right in the heart of Kentucky.But I believe,
almost know, the day is not distant, when the brave men of Kentucky who
are true to their traditions and the South will arise in their might,
and place Kentucky where she belongs, as one of the brightest stars in
the galaxy of Confederate States.In your name, fellow-citizens, I want
to apologize to this gallant young Kentuckian for the insult offered
him."The young lieutenant ceased speaking, but as with one voice, the
multitude began to cry, "Go on!A speech, Bailie, a speech!"Thus abjured, Lieutenant Bailie Peyton, for it was he, mounted a
dry-goods box, and for half an hour poured forth such a torrent of
eloquence that he swayed the vast audience, which had gathered, as the
leaves of the forest are swayed by the winds of heaven.He first spoke of the glorious Southland; her sunny skies, her sweeping
rivers, her brave people.He pictured to them the home of their
childhood, the old plantation, where slept in peaceful graves the loved
ones gone before.Strong men stood with tears running down their cheeks; women sobbed
convulsively."Is there one present that will not die for such a land?"he cried in a voice as clear as a trumpet, and there went up a mighty
shout of "No, not one!"He then spoke of the North; how the South would fain live in peace with
her, but had been spurned, reviled, traduced.Faces began to darken,
hands to clench.Then the speaker launched into a terrific philippic
against the North.He told of its strength, its arrogance, its
insolence.Lincoln was now marshaling his hireling hosts to invade their
country, to devastate their land, to desecrate their homes, to let loose
their slaves, to ravish and burn."Are we men," he cried, "and refuse
to protect our homes, our wives, our mothers, our sisters!"Men wept and cried like children, then
raved and yelled like madmen.With clenched hands raised towards heaven,
they swore no Yankee invader would ever leave the South alive.Women,
with hysterical cries, beseeched their loved ones to enlist.They
denounced as cowards those who refused.The recruiting officers present
reaped a rich harvest.As for Fred, he stood as one in a trance.Like
the others, he had been carried along, as on a mighty river, by the
fiery stream of eloquence he had heard.He saw the Southland invaded by
a mighty host, leaving wreck and ruin in its wake.He heard helpless
women praying to be delivered from the lust of brutal slaves, and
raising his hand to heaven he swore that such things should never be.His breast was torn with conflicting emotions,
he knew not what to think."I think you told me you were going to Nashville."It was Bailie Peyton
who spoke.Will you not go with me to my father's and stay all
night, and I will ride with you to Nashville in the morning?"Fred readily consented, for he was weary, and he also wanted to see more
of this wonderful young orator.Colonel Peyton, the father of Bailie Peyton, resided some three miles
out of Gallatin on the Nashville pike, and was one of the distinguished
men of Tennessee.He opposed secession to the last, and when the State
seceded he retired to his plantation, and all during the war was a
non-combatant.So grand was his character, such confidence did both
sides have in his integrity, that he was honored and trusted by both.He
never faltered in his love for the Union, yet did everything possible to
save his friends and neighbors from the wrath of the Federal
authorities.It was common report that more than once he saved Gallatin
from being burned to the ground for its many acts of hostility to the
Union forces.War laid a heavy hand on Colonel Peyton; and his son the
apple of his eye was brought home a corpse.He bound up his broken heart, and did what he could to
soothe others who had been stricken the same as he.Fred was given a genuine Southern welcome at the hospitable mansion of
Colonel Peyton.As for Bailie, the younger members of the household went
wild over him, even the servants wore a happier smile now "dat Massa
Bailie had cum."After supper the family assembled on the old-fashioned porch to enjoy
the cool evening air, and the conversation, as all conversations were in
those days, was on the war.Bailie was overflowing with the exuberance
of his spirits.He believed that the victory at Bull Run was the
beginning of the end, that Washington was destined to fall, and that
President Davis would dictate peace from that city.He saw arise before
him a great nation, the admiration of the whole world; and as he spoke
of the glory that would come to the South, his whole soul seemed to
light up his countenance.Throughout Bailie's discourse, Colonel Peyton sat silent and listened.Sometimes a sad smile would come over his features at some of his son's
witty sallies or extravagant expressions.Bailie seeing his father' dejection, turned to him and said:

"Cheer up, father; I shall soon be back in Nashville practicing my
profession, the war over; and in the greatness and grandeur of the South
you will forget your love for the old Union."The colonel shook his head, and turning to Fred, began to ask him
questions concerning Kentucky and the situation there.Fred answered him
truthfully and fully to the best of his knowledge.Colonel Peyton then
said to his son:

"Bailie, you know how dear you are to me, and how much I regret the
course you are taking; yet I will not chide you, for it is but natural
for you to go with the people you love.It is not only you, it is the
entire South that has made a terrible mistake.That the South had
grievances, we all know; but secession was not the cure.Bailie, you are
mistaken about the war being nearly over; it has hardly begun.If
Beauregard ever had a chance to capture Washington, that chance is now
lost by his tardiness.The North has men and money; it will spare
neither.You have heard what this young man has said about Kentucky.Neither side will
keep up the farce of neutrality longer than it thinks it an advantage to
do so.When the time comes, the Federal armies will sweep through
Kentucky and invade Tennessee.Their banners will be seen waving along
this road; Nashville will fall."cried Bailie, springing to his feet, "Nashville in the hands of
the Lincolnites.May I die before I see the accursed flag of the
North waving over the proud capitol of my beloved Tennessee."He looked like a young god, as he stood there, proud, defiant, his eye
flashing, his breast heaving with emotion.His father gazed on him a moment in silence.A look of pride, love,
tenderness, passed over his face; then his eyes filled with tears, and
he turned away trembling with emotion.Had he a dim realization that the
prayer of his son would be granted, and that he would not live to see
the Union flag floating over Nashville?That night Frederic Shackelford knelt by his bedside with a trembling
heart.Bailie Peyton's speech, his enthusiasm, his earnestness had had a
powerful influence on him.Was the South
fighting, as Bailie claimed, for one of the holiest causes for which a
patriotic people ever combated; and that their homes, the honor of their
wives and daughters were at stake?"Oh, Lord, show me the right way!"Then there came to him, as if whispered in his ear by the sweetest of
voices, the words of his mother, "_God will never permit a nation to be
founded whose chief corner-stone is human slavery._" He arose, strong,
comforted; the way was clear; there would be no more doubt.The next morning the young men journeyed to Nashville together.On the
way Bailie poured out his whole soul to his young companion.He saw
nothing in the future but success.In no possible way could the North
subjugate the South.But the silver tones no longer influenced Fred;
there was no more wavering in his heart.But he ever said that Bailie
Peyton was one of the most fascinating young men he ever met, and that
the remembrance of that ride was one of the sweetest of his life.When a few months afterward, he wept over Peyton's lifeless body
stretched on the battlefield, he breathed a prayer for the noble soul
that had gone so early to its Creator.Fred found Nashville a seething sea of excitement.Nothing was thought
of, talked of, but the war.There was no thought of the hardships, the
suffering, the agony, the death that it would bring--nothing but vain
boasting, and how soon the North would get enough of it.The people
acted as though they were about to engage in the festivities of some
gala day, instead of one of the most gigantic wars of modern times.It
was the case of not one, but of a whole people gone mad.Although Fred's uncle and family were greatly surprised to see him, he
was received with open arms.Shackelford was busily engaged in
raising a regiment for the Confederate service, and as Bailie Peyton had
said, had been commissioned as major.Fred's cousin, George Shackelford,
although but two years older than he, was to be adjutant, and Fred found
the young man a little too conceited for comfort.Not so with his cousin Kate, a most beautiful girl the same age as
himself, and they were soon the closest of friends.But Kate was a
terrible fire-eater.She fretted and pouted because Fred would not abuse
the Yankees with the same vehemence that she did."We women would turn
out and beat them back with broomsticks."Fred laughed, and then little Bess came toddling up to him, with "Tousin
Fed, do 'ankees eat 'ittle girls?""Bless you, Bessie, I am afraid they would eat you, you are so sweet,"
cried Fred, catching her in his arms and covering her face with kisses."No danger," tartly responded Kate; "they will never reach here to get
a chance.""Don't be too sure, my pretty cousin; I may yet live to see you flirting
with a Yankee officer.""You will see me dead first," answered Kate, with flashing eye.It was a very pleasant visit that Fred had, and he was sorry when the
four days, the limit of his visit, were up.The papers that he had
brought were all signed, and in addition he took numerous letters and
messages back with him.When leaving, his uncle handed him a pass signed by the Governor of the
State."There will be no getting through our lines into Kentucky without this,"
said his uncle."Tennessee is like a rat-trap; it is much easier to get
in than to get out."Fred met with no adventure going back, until he approached the Kentucky
line south of Scottsville.Here he found the road strongly guarded by
soldiers."To my home near Danville, Kentucky," answered Fred."No, you don't," said the officer; "we have orders to let no one pass.""But I have permission from the Governor," replied Fred, handing out his
pass.The officer looked at it carefully, then looked Fred over, for he was
fully described in the document, and handed it back with, "I reckon
it's all right; you can go."And Fred was about to ride on, when a man
came running up with a fearful oath, and shouting: "That's you, is it,
my fine gentleman?Now you will settle with Bill Pearson for striking
him like a <DW65>!"and there stood the man he had struck at Gallatin,
with the fiery red mark still showing across his face.As quick as a flash Fred snatched a revolver from the holster."Up with
your hands," said he coolly but firmly.Pearson was taken by surprise,
and his hands went slowly up.The officer looked from one to the other,
and then asked what it meant.[Illustration: As quick as a flash Fred snatched a Revolver from the
holster.]Bill, in a whining tone, told him how on the day he had enlisted, Fred
had struck him "just like a <DW65>."Fred, in a few words, told his side
of the story."And Bailie Peyton said ye were all right, and Bill here called ye a
coward and a liah?""Well, Bill, I reckon you got what you deserved.With a muttered curse, Pearson fell back, and Fred rode on, but had gone
but a few yards when there was the sharp report of a pistol, and a ball
cut through his hat rim.He looked back just in time to see Bill Pearson
felled like an ox by a blow from the butt of a revolver in the hands of
the angry officer.Once in Kentucky Fred breathed freer, but he was stopped several times
and closely questioned, and once or twice the fleetness of his horse
saved him from unpleasant companions.It was with a glad heart that he
found himself once more at home.CHAPTER V.

FATHER AND SON.Fred's journey to Nashville and back had consumed eleven days.It was
now August, a month of intense excitement throughout Kentucky.It was a
month of plot and counterplot.The great question as to whether Kentucky
would be Union or Confederate trembled in the balance.Those who had been neutral were becoming outspoken
for one side or the other.He was fast
becoming a partisan of the South.Letters which Fred brought him from
his brother in Nashville confirmed him in his opinion.In these letters
his brother begged him not to disgrace the name of Shackelford by siding
with the Lincolnites.He heard from Fred a full account of his journey, commended him for his
bravery, and said that he did what every true Kentuckian should do,
resent an insult; but he should not have sent him had he known he would
have been exposed to such grave dangers."Now, Fred," he continued; "you and your horse need rest.Do not leave
home for a few days."His cousin Calhoun came to see him, and
when he told him how he had served the fellow in Gallatin who called him
a liar, Calhoun's enthusiasm knew no bounds.He jumped up and down and
yelled, and clapped Fred on the back, and called him a true Kentuckian,
even if he didn't favor the South."It seems to me, Fred, you are having all the fun, while I am staying
here humdrumming around home."That's what I envy, Fred; I must be a soldier.I long to hear the
singing of bullets, the wild cheering of men, to be in the headlong
charge," and the boy's face glowed with enthusiasm."I reckon, Cal, you will get there, if this racket keeps up much
longer," answered Fred."Speed the day," shouted Cal, as he jumped on his horse and rode away,
waving back a farewell.During these days, Fred noticed that quite a number of gentlemen, all
prominent Southern sympathizers, called on his father.It seemed to him
that his father was drifting away, and that a great gulf was growing
between them; and he resolved to open his whole heart and tell his
father just how he felt.One evening his uncle, Judge Pennington, came out from Danville,
accompanied by no less distinguished gentlemen than John C.
Breckinridge, Humphrey Marshall, John A. Morgan and Major Hockoday.Breckinridge was the idol of Kentucky, a knightly man in every respect.They had come to discuss the situation with Mr.Ten
thousand rifles had been shipped to Cincinnati, to be forwarded to Camp
Dick Robinson, for the purpose of arming the troops there; and the
question was should they allow these arms to be sent.The consultation
was held in the room directly below the one Fred occupied, and through a
friendly ventilator he heard the whole conversation.Morgan and Major Hockoday were for calling out the State Guards,
capturing Camp Dick Robinson, then march on Frankfort, drive out the
Legislature, and declare the State out of the Union.This was vigorously opposed by Breckinridge."You must remember," said
he, "that State sovereignty is the underlying principle of the Southern
Confederacy.If the States are not sovereign, the South had no right to
secede, and every man in arms against the Federal government is a
traitor.Kentucky, by more than a two-thirds vote, declined to go out of
the Union.But she has declared for neutrality; let us see that
neutrality is enforced.""Breckinridge," said Morgan, "your logic is good, but your position is
weak."Their shipment in the State would be a violation of our neutrality; the
whole power of the State should be used to prevent it," answered
Breckinridge."Now
that he is gone, the State Guard is virtually without a head.""Hobnobbing with President Lincoln in Washington, or with President
Davis in Richmond, I don't know which," answered Marshall, with a laugh.Buckner is all right," responded Breckinridge; "but he ought to be
here now."It was finally agreed that a meeting should be called at Georgetown, in
Scott county, on the 17th, at which meeting decisive steps should be
taken to prevent the shipment of the arms.All of this Fred heard, and then, to his consternation, he heard his
father say:

"Gentlemen, before you go, I want to introduce my son to you.I am
afraid he is a little inclined to be for the Union, and I think a
meeting with you gentlemen may serve to make him see things in a
different light."So Fred was called, and nerving himself for the interview, he went down.As he entered the room, Major Hockoday stared at him a moment in
surprise, and then exclaimed:

"Great God!Shackelford, that is not your son; that is the young villain
who stole my dispatch from Conway!""The very same," said Fred, smiling."How do you do, Major; I am glad to
see you looking so well.I see that the loss of that dispatch didn't
worry you so much as to make you sick."stammered the major, choking with rage, "you--you impudent
young----" here the major did choke.Fred rather enjoyed it, and he continued: "And how is my friend Captain
Conway?I trust that he was not injured in his hurried exit from the
cars the other night."All the rest of the company looked nonplused, but Morgan, who roared
with laughter."It means," answered Fred, "that I got the major's dispatches away from
Captain Conway, and thus saved Louisville from a scene of bloodshed and
horror.And, Major, you should thank me, for your scheme would have
failed anyway.I really saved any
number of your friends from being killed, and there you sit choking with
rage, instead of calling me a good boy.""Leave the room, Fred," commanded Mr.Shackelford; "that you should
insult a guest here in my own house is more than I can imagine."Bowing, Fred retired, and the company turned to Major Hockoday for an
explanation of the extraordinary scene.The major told the story and
ended with saying: "I am sorry, Shackelford, that he is your boy.If I
were you, I should get him out of the country as soon as possible; he
will make you trouble.""I will settle with him, never fear," replied Mr."Look here, Major," spoke up Morgan; "you are sore because that boy
outwitted you, and he did you a good turn, as he said.If your program
had been carried out, Louisville would be occupied by Federal troops
to-day.Thank him because he pulled the wool over Conway's eyes.two old duffers fooled by a boy!"and Morgan enjoyed a hearty laugh, in
which all but Major Hockoday and Mr."And, Shackelford," continued Morgan, after he had enjoyed his laugh, "I
want you to let that boy alone; he is the smartest boy in Kentucky.I
want him with me when I organize my cavalry brigade.""I am afraid, Morgan," said Breckinridge, "that you will be disappointed
in that, though I hope not for Mr.The boy looks to
me as if he had a will of his own.""Oh, he will come around all right," responded Morgan.After making full arrangements for the meeting to be held in Scott
county on the 17th, the company dispersed.Hours after they had gone Fred heard his father restlessly pacing the
floor.thought he, "like me, he cannot sleep.I wonder what he
will say to me in the morning; but come what may, I must and shall be
for the Union."Shackelford was silent until the close of the
meal, when he simply said, "Fred, I would like to see you in the
library."Fred bowed, and replied, "I will be there in a few moments, father."When Fred entered the library, his father was seated at the table
writing.There was a look of care on his face, and Fred was startled to
see how pale he was.Pushing aside his writing, he sat for some moments looking at his son in
silence.At last he said:

"Fred, you can hardly realize how pained I was last night to hear what I
did.You are
old enough to realize something of the desperate nature of the struggle
in which the two sections of the country are engaged.For the past two
weeks I have thought much of what was the right thing to do.I love my
country; I love and revere the old flag.As long as the slightest hope
remained of restoring it as it was, I was for the Union.But this is now
hopeless; too much blood has been shed.Neither would the South, if
granted her own terms, now go back to a Union she not only hates, but
loathes.The North has no lawful right to use coercion.Kentucky, in her
sovereign right as a State, has declared for neutrality; and it has been
contemptuously ignored by the North.Nelson, a man to be despised by
every patriot, has not only organized troops in our midst, but now seeks
to have the Federal government arm them.Such true men as Breckinridge,
Marshall, Buckner, Morgan, and a host of other loyal Kentuckians have
sworn that this shall never be.If
he ascertains that the Lincoln government will not respect the
neutrality of the State by withdrawing every Federal officer and
soldier, he is going to proceed to Richmond and offer his services to
the Confederate Government.Once accepted, he will immediately form the
State Guards into an army, and turn them over to the Confederacy.Regiments must be formed, and I have been offered the colonelcy of one
of these regiments."Fred was startled, and stammered, "You--father--you?"If your mother had lived, it would have been
different, but now I can go far better than many who have gone.I have
arranged all of my business.I shall place Belle in school in
Cincinnati.John Stimson, who has been our overseer for so many years,
will remain and conduct the plantation.My only trouble has been to
dispose of you satisfactorily.My wish is to send you to college, but
knowing your adventurous disposition, and how fond you are of exciting
and, I might add, desperate deeds, I am afraid you would do no good in
your studies.""You are right, father," said Fred, in a low voice.Shackelford, "I was going to offer
to take you with me in the army, not as an enlisted soldier, but rather
as company and aid to me.But from what I heard last night, I do not see
how this is possible, unless what you have done has been a mere boyish
freak, which I do not think.""It was no freak," said Fred, with an unsteady voice.Therefore, the only thing I can do is to send you
away--to Europe.What do you say, an English or a German university?""And you are really going into the Confederate army, father?""And you want me to play the coward and flee my country in this her hour
of greatest peril?Shackelford looked astonished, and then a smile of joy passed over
his features; could it be that Fred was going with him?"Not if you wish to go with me, my son."Fred arose and tottered to his father, sank beside his knee, and looking
up with a tear-stained face, said in a pleading voice:

"Don't go into the Confederate army, father; don't turn against the old
flag."And the boy laid his head on his father's knee and sobbed as if
his heart would break.He tried to speak, but a lump arose
in his throat and choked him; so he sat in silence smoothing the hair of
his son with his hand as gently as his mother would have done."What would mother say," at length sobbed the boy.Shackelford shivered as with a chill; then said brokenly: "If your
mother had lived, child, my first duty would have been to her.Neither would your mother, it mattered not what she
thought herself, ever have asked me to violate my own conscience.""Father, let us both stay at home.We can do that, you thinking as you
do, and I thinking as I do.We can
do good by comforting those who will be stricken; and mother will look
down from heaven, and bless us.We cannot control our sympathies, but we
can our actions.We can both be truly non-combatants.""Don't, Fred, don't tempt me," gasped Mr."My word is
given, and a Shackelford never breaks his word.Then I cannot stand idly
by, and see my kindred made slaves.I must draw my sword for the right,
and the South has the right.I go in the
Confederate army--you to Europe.Fred arose, his face as pale as death, but with a look so determined, so
fixed that it seemed as if in a moment the boy had been transformed into
a man."Father," he asked, "I have always been a good son, obeying you, and
never intentionally grieving you, have I not?""You have, Fred, been a good, obedient son, God bless you!""Just before mother died," continued Fred, "she called me to her
bedside.She told me how my great-grandfather had died on Bunker Hill,
and asked me to always be true to my country.She asked me to promise
never to raise my hand against the flag.You
would not have me break that promise, father?"Go to Europe, stay there until the trouble is over."Listen, for I believe her words to be prophetic:
'God will never prosper a nation whose chief corner-stone is human
slavery.'""Stop, Fred, stop, I can't bear it.This
war is not waged to perpetuate slavery; it is waged to preserve the
rights of the States guaranteed to them by the Constitution.""Do not deceive yourself, father; slavery has everything to do with it.No State would have thought of seceding if it had not been for slavery.Slavery is the sole, the only cause of the war.It is a poor cause for
noble men to give up their lives.""We will not argue the question," said Mr.Shackelford, pettishly; "you
will forget your foolishness in Europe.""I shall not only not go to Europe, but I shall enter the army."The father staggered as if a knife had pierced his heart.He threw out
his hands wildly, and then pressed them to his breast and gasped: "Fred,
Fred, you don't mean it!""I was never more in earnest in my life."Shackelford's feelings underwent a sudden change.His face became
purple with rage; love for his son was forgotten."Do that," he thundered, "do that, and you are no son of mine.I will
disown you, I will cast you out, I will curse you.""Father," said Fred, in a low tremulous voice, "if part we must, do not
let us part in anger.Never have I loved you better than now; you do
what you believe to be right; I do what I believe to be right.We both
perform our duty as we see it.God will hold the one who blunders
blameless.Shackelford, with white, drawn face, pointed to the door, and
uttered the one word, "Go!""Oh, father, father, do not send me away with a curse.See, father,"
and he turned to his mother's portrait which hung on the wall, "mother
is looking down on us; mother, who loved us both so well.How can you
account to her that you have turned away her only son with a curse, and
for no crime, but the one of loving his country.""Boy, boy, have you no mercy that you will not only break my heart, but
tear it out by the roots.""I am the one who asks for mercy, who pleads that you send me not away
with a curse.""Fred, for the sake of your mother, I will not curse you, but I will, if
you remain in my sight.Here," and he went to his safe, opened it, and
took out a package of money."Here is $1,000, take it and Prince, and
begone.Go to that man, Nelson, who has seduced you.It is a heavy
account I have to settle with him.Go before I forget myself and curse
you."For a moment Fred gazed in his father's face; there was no wrath,
nothing but love in his look.Then he took the money and said: "Father,
I thank you; I not only thank you, but bless you.May God protect you in
the midst of dangers.Not a day shall pass but I shall pray for your
safety.Shackelford staggered towards the door.It was the cry of a
repentant soul.The boy's footstep echoed outside along the hall,
fainter and fainter.The father groped blindly, as if about to fall.The outer door closed; his boy was gone.Shackelford staggered backward and groaned, as if in mortal agony.Then his eye caught the portrait of his wife looking down on him.Raising his arms beseechingly, he cried: "Oh, Laura!Don't look at me so; I didn't curse him.It was with a heavy heart that Fred left the house.As he shut the door,
he thought he heard his father call.He stopped and listened, but
hearing nothing, he went on.Getting his horse, he rode to Danville.His
little sister was visiting at Judge Pennington's, and he wanted to see
her, as well as to bid farewell to his uncle, and see Calhoun.He had no
idea but that his uncle would forbid him the house when he heard of his
being cast off by his father.He found Judge Pennington at home, and frankly told him what had
happened, shielding his father as much as possible, and not sparing
himself."Why, why, you young jackanapes," he roared; "it's a horse-whipping you
want, and you would get it if you were a boy of mine!A good tanning is what
you need, and, by Jove!I have a mind to give it to you," and he shook
his cane threateningly."Going to join the Yankee army, are you?A Shackelford in the Yankee army!I'll,
I'll--" but the judge was too angry to say more."Now, uncle, don't get in a rage; it's no use.I shall join the Union army in some capacity.""Get out of my sight, you young idiot, you!"he asked, looking from one
to the other."If you were as big a fool as your
cousin there, I would skin you alive.""Glad you have at last come to a full appreciation of my worth," coolly
replied Calhoun."For years I have had the virtues of my cousin held up
to me as a shining mark to follow.Now, I find I am saving my skin by
surpassing him in the wisdom of this world."Why, this fool says he is going to enlist in the Yankee army," foamed
the Judge, pointing at Fred."And this fool says he is going to enlist in the Southern army,"
answered Calhoun, pointing to himself."Calhoun, you don't mean it?""Yes, I do mean it," stoutly replied the boy.Haven't you been
talking for years of the rights of the South?Are you not doing
everything possible to take Kentucky out of the Union?Haven't you
encouraged the enlistment of soldiers for the South?Father, I don't want to quarrel with you as
Fred has with his father, but I am going into the Southern army, and I
hope with your blessing."Having his son go to war was so much
different from having some one else's son go."Do not do anything rash, my son," he said to Calhoun."When the time
comes if you must go, I will see what can be done for you.As for you,
Fred," he said, "you stay here with Calhoun until I return.I am going
to see your father," and calling for his horse, the judge rode away.Calling the boys into a
room for a private interview, he said: "Fred, I have been to see your
father, and he is very much chagrined over your disobedience.His fierce
anger is gone, and in its place a deep sorrow.He does not ask you to
give up your principle, but he does ask that you do not enter the
Federal army.You are much too young, to say nothing of other
considerations.You should accept his proposition and go to Europe.We
have come to this conclusion, that if you will go I will send Calhoun
with you.Calhoun wants to enter the
Southern army, you the Northern, so neither section loses anything.You
have both done your duty to your section, and both will have the
pleasure and advantage of a university course in Europe."That it is a mean underhanded way to prevent me from entering the
army," flared up Calhoun."Be careful, boy," said the judge, getting red in the face."You will
not find me as lenient as Mr.Shackelford has been with Fred.Calhoun's temper was up, and there would have been a scene right then
and there if Fred had not interfered."Uncle," said he, "there is no use of Calhoun and you disagreeing over
this matter.I shall not go to Europe; so far as I am concerned, it is
settled.As for Calhoun entering the army, you must settle that between
you."Calhoun pressed Fred's hand, and whispered, "Good for you, Fred; you
have got me out of a bad scrape.I think father will consent to my going
in the army now."The judge stared at the boys, and then sputtered: "Both of you ought to
be soundly thrashed.But if Fred's mind is made up, it is no use
pursuing the matter further.""Then," answered the judge, "I will say no more, only, Fred, my house is
open to you.When you get sick of your foolish experiment you can have
a home here.Your father refuses to see you unless you consent to obey.""I thank you, uncle," said Fred, in a low voice, "but I do not think I
shall trouble you much."Shackelford, it must be said it was by his request
that Judge Pennington made this offer to Fred.Shackelford's heart
had softened towards his son, and he did not wish to cast him off
entirely.But the destiny of father and son was to be more closely
interwoven than either thought.Fred remained at his uncle's until the next day.He and Calhoun slept
together or rather occupied the same bed, for they had too much talking
to do to sleep.Both
longed for the fierce excitement of war.They did not realize that they might face each other on the field of
battle.They talked of their oath, and again promised to keep it to the
letter.They were like two brothers, each going on a long journey in different
directions.Their parting the next morning was most affectionate, and when Fred rode
away he turned his horse's head in the direction of Camp Dick Robinson.The soldiers that Nelson had gathered at Camp Dick Robinson were a
nondescript set, not only in clothing, but in arms.Squirrel rifles and
shotguns were the principal weapons.When he first began organizing his
troops, Nelson had ordered guns and ammunition from the Federal
government, and his impetuous spirit chafed at their non-arrival.Consequently he was not in the best of humor, and was mentally cursing
the government for its exceeding slowness when Fred rode up to his
headquarters.Fred's ride had been anything but a pleasant one.That he had taken a
desperate step for a boy of his age, he well knew.He passionately loved
his father, and the thought that he had been disowned for disobedience
was a bitter one.He strove to fight back the lump that would rise in
his throat; and in spite of all his efforts to keep them back, the tears
would well up in his eyes.He had given himself, heart and soul, to the cause of the Union, and had
no thought of turning back.Even if Nelson did not receive him, if it
came to the worst he would enlist as a private soldier."A boy to see me," snapped Nelson, when an orderly reported that a boy
was outside and wished to see him.The orderly reported to Fred Nelson's kind wish."Tell him," replied Fred, rather indignantly, "that Fred Shackelford
wishes to see him."The orderly soon returned, and ushered Fred into the presence of the
irate officer."It is you, Fred, is it?"said Nelson, as our hero entered and saluted
him."I am sorry I told you to go where I did, but the truth is I am out
of sorts."News, General, yes; and quite important, if you do not already know it.But first," continued Fred, glancing at the star which glistened on
Nelson's shoulder, "let me congratulate you.I see you are no longer
Lieutenant Nelson of the navy, but General Nelson of the army.""Yes," replied Nelson, with a twinkle in his eye, "I now command on
land; so, young man, be careful how you try to ride over me."Fred laughed as he thought of his first meeting with Nelson, and
replied: "I shall never so forget myself again, General.""Now," continued Nelson, "give me the news.You said you had something
important to communicate.""So I have if you are not already informed.You are expecting arms for
your men, are you not?""I am, and I am all out of patience because I do not receive them."I know that you will never receive them, if the friends of the South
can prevent it; and that they are taking active measures to do.""Tell me all about it," said Nelson, manifesting the greatest interest.Fred then related all that he had heard at the meeting which took place
at his father's house.Then he asked,
"Where did you learn of all this?""Please do not ask me," replied Fred, in a low voice."I can only say
the information is absolutely correct."Your news is,
indeed, important.You have again rendered me important service, Fred.How I wish you could
take up with that offer I made you.""That is what I have come for, General, if you will accept my poor
services."Fred, and then replied: "I have no home; my father has cast me
out.""I had my choice to accompany him in the Confederate army or to go to
Europe to attend some university.Nelson knitted his brows a moment as if in thought, and then replied:
"You were certainly right in refusing the first; I wonder at your father
making you the proposition.The last was a very reasonable proposition,
and a wise one.I am afraid I am to blame
for your folly--for such it is.The offer I made you appealed to your
boyish imagination and love of adventure, and caused you to go against
the wishes of your father.Four or five years at some foreign university
is a chance not to be idly thrown away, to say nothing about obeying the
wishes of your father.As much as I would like your services, Fred, be
reconciled to your father; go to Europe, and keep out of this infernal
war.It will cost the lives of thousands of just such noble youths as
you before it ends; and," he continued, with a tinge of sadness in his
tone, "I sometimes think I shall never live to see it end.I am
surrounded by hundreds of enemies who are hungering for my life.""Your advice, General, is most kindly given," answered Fred, "and I
sincerely thank you for what you have said; but it is impossible for me
to accept it.He gave me
$1,000 and my horse, and told me to go my way.I love my father, but if
I should now go back after what has passed, he would despise me, as I
would despise myself.Father is the soul of honor; if I should play the
craven after all that I have said, he would not only despise, but loathe
me.Now I can hope that time may once more unite us.Be assured that
though his heart may be filled with anger towards me now, if I prove
myself worthy, he will yet be proud of his son."He grasped Fred's hand, and exclaimed with
much feeling: "You must have a noble father, or he could not have such a
son.Consider yourself attached to my staff
as confidential scout and messenger.I do not wish you to enlist; you
will be more free to act if you are not an enlisted soldier."Fred warmly thanked the general for his expression of confidence, and
announced himself as ready for orders.Nelson smiled at his ardor, and then said: "I believe you stated that
that meeting is to take place in Scott county the 17th?"How would you like to go
there, and see what you can learn?""I can make it all right, but I am afraid some of
them may know me.""We will fix that all right," responded Nelson.The next morning, a boy with jet black hair and hands and face stained
brown rode away from General Nelson's headquarters.It would have been
a close observer indeed that would have taken that boy for Fred
Shackelford.It was on the evening of the 16th that Fred reached Georgetown.He found
the little city full of excited partisans of the South.At the meeting
the next day many fierce speeches were made.The extremists were for at
once calling out the State Guards, and marching on Camp Dick Robinson,
and capturing it at the point of the bayonet.Governor Magoffin was instructed to protest in the strongest
language to President Lincoln, and to call on him at once to disband the
troops at Dick Robinson.As for allowing the arms to be shipped, it was
resolved that it should be prevented at all hazards.When Fred arrived at Georgetown, he found at the hotel that he could
procure a room next to the one occupied by Major Hockoday, and believing
that the major's room might be used for secret consultations of the more
violent partisans of the South, he engaged it, hoping that in some
manner he might become possessed of some of their secrets.While the
room engaged by Major Hockoday was unoccupied he deftly made a hole
through the plastering in his room, and then with the aid of a sharpened
stick made a very small opening through the plastering into the next
room.He then rolled up a sheet of paper in the shape of a trumpet.By
placing the small end of the paper in the small opening, and putting his
ear to the larger end, he was enabled to hear much that was said,
especially if everything was still and the conversation was animated.The result exceeded his most sanguine expectations.After the close of
the public meeting, a number of the more prominent actors gathered in
Major Hockoday's room.A heated discussion arose as to how Kentucky could the most quickly
throw off her neutrality, and join her fortune to that of the
Confederacy."Gentlemen," said Major Hockoday, "I believe every one present is a true
son of the South, therefore I can speak to you freely.The first thing,
as we all agree, is to prevent the shipment of these arms.Then if
Lincoln refuses to disband the troops at Dick Robinson, the program is
this: You all know that General Buckner has been in Washington for some
time talking neutrality.In a measure he has gained the confidence of
Lincoln, and has nearly received the promise that no Federal troops from
other States will be ordered into the State as long as the Confederate
troops keep out.Buckner has secretly gone to Richmond, where he will
accept a commission from the Confederate government.He will then come
back by way of the South, and issue a proclamation to loyal Kentuckians
to join his standard.The State Guards should join him to a man.Then,
if Lincoln refuses to disband the soldiers at Dick Robinson, the
Confederate government will occupy the State with troops, claiming and
justly, too, that the Federal government has not respected the
neutrality of the State.The coming of the Confederate troops will fire
the heart of every true Kentuckian, and all over the State Confederates
will spring to arms, and the half-armed ragamuffins of Nelson will be
scattered like a flock of sheep.By a dash Louisville can be occupied,
and Kentucky will be where she belongs--in the Southern Confederacy.What think you, gentlemen, of the program?"Strong men embraced each other
with tears streaming down their cheeks.They believed with their whole
hearts and souls that the South was right, and that Kentucky's place was
with her Southern sisters, and now that there seemed to be a possibility
of this, their enthusiasm knew no bounds.As for Fred, he drew a long breath.He knew that he had gained
information of the greatest value to the Federal cause."It is time for me to be going," he said to himself."Nelson must know
of this as soon as possible."As he passed out of the room, he came face to face with Major Hockoday.The major stared at him a moment, and then roughly asked: "What is your
name, and what are you doing here?""I see no reason why I should report to you," replied Fred."I am a
guest at this hotel, and am minding my own business.I wish I could say
as much for you," and he walked away.The major looked after him, his face red with anger, and muttered:
"Strange!but if that boy didn't have black hair and was not dark, I
should swear it was Fred Shackelford.But a gentleman came along just then and engaged him in conversation.As
soon as he could disengage himself, the major examined the hotel
register to find who occupied room 13.Opposite that number he found
written in a bold, boyish hand:

"F. Carrington....Fred's full name was Fred Carrington Shackelford, and he had registered
his given names only.Major Hockoday made careful inquiry about the boy,
but no one knew him.He had paid his bill, called for his horse, and
rode away.Major Hockoday was troubled,
why he hardly knew; but somehow he felt as if the presence of that
black-haired boy boded no good to their cause.All of this time Fred was riding swiftly towards Lexington.General Nelson listened to his report not only with attention, but with
astonishment."Fred," said he, "you are a marvel; you are worth a brigade of soldiers.I have been reporting all the time to the authorities at Washington that
Buckner was heart and soul with the South; but they wouldn't believe me.Neither will they believe me now, but I can act on your information.""Fred," continued the general, walking rapidly up and down the room, "I
sometimes think there is a set of dunderheads at Washington.They think
they know everything, and don't know anything.If Kentucky is saved, it
will be saved by the loyal men of the State.Just think of their
listening to Buckner instead of me," and the general worked himself into
a violent rage, and it took him some time to cool off.Then he said: "I
will try once more to hurry up those arms.I will send you to-morrow to
Cincinnati as a special messenger.I will write what you have told me,
and I want you to impress it on General Anderson's mind.Tell him to
hurry, hurry, or it will be too late."The next morning Fred was on his way back to Nicholasville.From there
he took the train for Cincinnati, at which place he arrived in due time.He delivered his dispatches to General Anderson, who, after reading
them, looked at him kindly and said:

"General Nelson sends a young messenger, but he tells me of the great
service you have performed and the valuable information you have
gathered.It is certainly wonderful for so young a boy.Fred modestly related what had occurred at Georgetown.General Anderson listened attentively, and when Fred had finished, said:
"You certainly deserve the credit General Nelson has given you.The
information you received is of the greatest importance, and will be at
once forwarded to Washington.In the mean time, we must do the best we
can.General Nelson may think I am slow, but there is so much to do--so
much to do, and so little to do with," and the general sighed.Fred
observed him with interest, for he realized that he was talking to the
hero who had defended Fort Sumter to the last.The general was broken in health, and looked sick and careworn, and not
the man to assume the great burden he was bearing.It was with joy that
Fred heard that the arms would be shipped in a day or two.But when the
train carrying them was ready to start, Fred saw, to his amazement, that
it was not to be guarded."That train will never get through," he thought."It is funny how they
do things."Fred was right; the enemies of the government were not idle.Spies were
all around, and they knew when the train was to start to a minute, and
the news was flashed ahead.At a small station in Harrison county the
train was stopped by a large mob, who tore up the track in front, making
it impossible for it to proceed.There was nothing to do but to take the
train back to Cincinnati, and with it a communication to the officials
of the road that if they attempted to run the train again the whole
track would be torn up from Covington to Lexington.The railway officials, thoroughly frightened, begged General Anderson
not to attempt to run the train again.The Southern sympathizers were
jubilant over their success, and boldly declared the arms would never be
shipped.As for Fred, he was completely disgusted, and expressed himself so."Well, my boy, what would you do?""I would send a regiment and a
battery on a train ahead of the one carrying the arms, and if the mob
interfered I would sweep them from the face of the earth.""Well said, my lad," replied Anderson, his face lighting up and his eyes
kindling."I feel that way myself, but a soldier must obey orders, and
unfortunately I have different orders.""I have orders to load them on a steamboat, and send them up the
Kentucky River to Hickman Bridge.""You don't seem pleased," said the general.blurted out Fred; "excuse me, General, but it is all
foolishness.The boat will be
stopped the same as the train."The general turned away, but Fred heard him say, as if to himself: "I am
afraid it will be so, but the government persists in tying our hands as
far as Kentucky is concerned."General Anderson's position was certainly an anomalous one--the
commander of a department, and yet not allowed to move troops into it.According to his orders, Fred took passage on the boat with the arms,
but he felt it would never be permitted to reach its destination.When the boat reached the confines of Owen
county they found a great mob congregated on the banks of the river.was the cry, "or we will burn the boat."The
captain tried to parley, but he was met with curses and jeers.Fred went on shore, and mingling with the mob, soon learned there was a
conspiracy on the part of the more daring to burn the boat, even if it
did turn back.Hurrying on board, Fred told the captain his only
salvation was to turn back at once, and to put on all steam.He did so,
and the boat and cargo were saved.Once more the Confederate sympathizers went wild with rejoicing, and the
Union men were correspondingly depressed.But the boat made an unexpected move, as far as the enemy were
concerned.Instead of proceeding back to Cincinnati, it turned down the
Ohio to Louisville.Here the arms were hastily loaded on the cars, and
started for Lexington.Fred was hurried on ahead to apprise General
Nelson of their coming.Fred delivered his message to the general, and
then said: "The train will never get through; it will be stopped at
Lexington, if not before.""If the train ever reaches Lexington I will have the arms," grimly
replied Nelson."Lexington is in my jurisdiction; there will be no
fooling, no parleying with traitors, if the train reaches that city."Then he turned to Colonel Thomas E. Bramlette, and said: "Colonel, take
a squadron of cavalry, proceed to Lexington, and when that train comes,
take charge of it and guard it to Nicholasville.I will have wagons
there to transport the arms here."Colonel Bramlette saluted, and replied: "General, I will return with
those arms or not at all.""Certainly, if you wish," answered Nelson."You have stayed by the arms
so far, and it is no more than right that you should be in at the
finish."The enemy was alert, and the news reached Lexington that the train
loaded with the arms and ammunition for the soldiers at Dick Robinson
was coming.Instantly the little city was aflame with excitement.The State Guards
under the command of John H. Morgan gathered at their armory with the
avowed intention of seizing the train by force.John C. Breckinridge
made a speech to the excited citizens, saying the train must be stopped,
if blood flowed.In the midst of this excitement Colonel Bramlette with his cavalry
arrived."Drive the Lincoln hirelings from the city!"shouted Breckinridge, and
the excited crowd took up the cry.A demand was at once drawn up, signed by Breckinridge, Morgan and many
others, and sent to Colonel Bramlette, requesting him to at once
withdraw from the city, or blood would be shed.Colonel Bramlette's lips curled in scorn as he read the demand, and
turning to the messenger who brought it, said: "Go tell the gentlemen
they shall have my answer shortly."Writing an answer, he turned to Fred, saying: "Here, my boy, for what
you have done, you richly deserve the honor of delivering this message."Right proudly did Fred bear himself as he delivered his message to
Breckinridge.Major Hockoday, who was standing by Breckinridge, scowled
and muttered, "It's that ---- Shackelford boy."Captain Conway heard him, and seeing Fred, with a fearful oath, sprang
towards him with uplifted hand.He had not seen Fred since that night he
plunged from the train.His adventure had become known, and he had to
submit to any amount of chaffing at being outwitted by a boy; and his
brother officers took great delight in calling out: "Look out, Conway,
here comes that detective from Danville!"This made Captain Conway hate Fred with all the ardor of his small soul,
and seeing the boy, made him so forget himself as to attack him.But a revolver flashed in his face, and a firm voice said: "Not so fast,
Captain."The irate captain was seized and dragged away, and when the tumult had
subsided Breckinridge said: "I am sorry to see the son of my friend,
Colonel Shackelford, engaged in such business; but it is the message
that he brings that concerns us."He then read the following laconic note from Colonel Bramlette:


     LEXINGTON, Aug.JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE, JOHN H. MORGAN AND OTHERS.Gentlemen:--I shall take those arms, and if a drop of Union blood
     be shed, I will not leave a single Secessionist alive in Lexington.THOMAS E. BRAMLETTE,
     _Colonel Commanding_.There was a breathless silence; faces of brave men grew pale.There were
oaths and muttered curses, but the mob began to melt away.The train arrived, and Colonel Bramlette took charge of it without
trouble.Just as the troop of cavalry was leaving Lexington, a boy came
out and thrust a note into Fred's hand.He opened it and read:


     TO FRED SHACKELFORD:

     Boy as you are, I propose to shoot you on sight, so be on your
     guard.Fred smiled, and handed the note to Colonel Bramlette, who read it and
said: "Fred, you will have to look out for that fellow."The journey back to Dick Robinson was without incident.The long looked
for arms and ammunition had come.It meant everything to those men
surrounded as they were with enemies on every side.In the midst of the
rejoicing, Fred was not forgotten.He and Colonel Bramlette were the
heroes of the hour.The fight for the possession of the arms was over.General Nelson, the man of iron
nerve, who, in the face of opposition from friends, the most direful
threats from foes, saved Central Kentucky to the Union, had been
relieved of his command and assigned to another field of labor.The new
commander to take his place was General George H. Thomas.To Fred the news that _his_ general, as he had come to look upon Nelson,
had been assigned to another command, was anything but pleasing."But
where Nelson goes, there will I go," was his thought."After all," he
said, bitterly, "what does it matter where I go.General Thomas, like Nelson, was a heavy, thickset man, but there the
likeness ended.Thomas never lost his temper, he never swore, he never
complained, he never got excited.He was always cool and collected, even
under the most trying circumstances.He afterwards became known to his
soldiers as "Pap Thomas," and was sometimes called "Slow-Trot Thomas,"
for the reason he was never known to ride his horse off a trot, even in
the most desperate battle.When General Thomas reported to Camp Dick Robinson he and Nelson held a
long consultation."This, General, is Fred Shackelford, the boy of whom I spoke," said
Nelson.Fred saluted the new commander, and then respectfully remained standing,
awaiting orders."Fred," continued General Nelson, "General Thomas and I have been
discussing you, and I have been telling him how valuable your services
have been.I fully expected to take you with me to my new command, but
both General Thomas and myself feel that just at present your services
are very much needed here.This camp is very important, and it is
surrounded with so many dangers that we need to take every precaution.You are not only well acquainted with the country, but you seem to have
a peculiar way of getting at the enemy's secrets no other one possesses.There is no doubt but you are needed here more than at Maysville, where
I am going.But we have concluded to leave it to you, whether you go or
stay.You may be sure I shall be pleased to have you go with me.Fred looked at General Thomas, and thought he had never seen a finer,
grander face; but he had grown very fond of the fiery Nelson, so he
replied:

"General Nelson, you know my feelings towards you.If I consulted simply my own wishes I should go with you.But
you have pointed out to me my duty.I am very grateful to General Thomas
for his feelings towards me.I shall stay as long as I am needed here,
and serve the general to the best of my ability.""Bravely said, Fred, bravely said," responded Nelson."You will find
General Thomas a more agreeable commander than myself.""There, General, that will do," said Thomas quietly.So it was settled that Fred was to stay for the present with General
Thomas.The next day Generals Thomas and Nelson went to Cincinnati to confer
with General Anderson, and Fred was invited to accompany them.Once more he was asked to lay before General Anderson the full text of
the conversation he had overheard at Georgetown.asked Thomas, who had listened very
closely to the recital."I am afraid," replied General Anderson, "that the authorities at
Washington do not fully realize the condition of affairs in Kentucky.Neither have they any conception of the intrigue going on to take the
State out of the Union.No doubt, General Buckner has been playing a
sharp game at Washington.He seems to have completely won the confidence
of the President.It is for this reason so many of our requests pass
unheeded.If what young Shackelford has heard is true, General Buckner
is now in Richmond.He is there to accept a command from the
Confederate government, and is to return here to organize the disloyal
forces of Kentucky to force the State out of the Union.Now, in the face
of these facts, what do you think of this," and the general read the
following:


     EXECUTIVE MANSION, Aug.My Dear Sir:--Unless there be reason to the contrary, not known to
     me, make out a commission for Simon B. Buckner as a
     Brigadier-General of volunteers.It is to be put in the hands of
     General Anderson, and delivered to General Buckner, or not, at the
     discretion of General Anderson.Of course, it is to remain a secret
     unless and until the commission is delivered.During the reading, General Thomas sat with immovable countenance,
betraying neither approbation nor disgust.he roared, "are they all idiots at Washington?Give him his commission,
Anderson, give him his commission, and then let Lincoln invite Jeff
Davis to a seat in the cabinet.It would be as sensible," and then he
poured forth such a volley of oaths that what he really meant to say
became obscure.When he had blown himself out, General Thomas quietly said: "Now,
General, that you have relieved yourself, let us again talk business.""I don't believe you would change countenance, Thomas, if Beauregard was
placed in command of the Federal armies," replied Nelson, pettishly."But Central Kentucky needed just
such fire and enthusiasm as you possess to save it from the clutches of
the rebels, and if I can only complete the grand work you have begun I
shall be content, and not worry over whom the President recommends for
office.""You will complete it, General; my work could not be left in better
hands," replied Nelson, completely mollified.In a few moments Nelson excused himself, as he had other duties to
perform.Looking after him, General Anderson said: "I am afraid Nelson's temper
and unruly tongue will get him into serious trouble yet.But he has done
what I believe no other man could have done as well.To his efforts,
more than to any other one man, do we owe our hold on Kentucky.""His lion-like courage and indomitable energy will cover a multitude of
faults," was the reply of General Thomas.Fred returned to Camp Dick Robinson with General Thomas, and he soon
found that the general was fully as energetic as Nelson, though in a
more quiet way.The amount of work that General Thomas dispatched was
prodigious.Every little detail was looked after, but there was no
hurry, no confusion.The camp began to assume a more military aspect,
and the men were brought under more thorough discipline.According to the
program which Fred had heard outlined at Georgetown, the Confederates
began their aggressive movements.Hickman, on the Mississippi River, was
occupied by the Confederate army under General Polk on the 5th.As swift
as a stroke of lightning, General Grant, who was in command at Cairo,
Illinois, retaliated by occupying Paducah on the 6th.General Polk then
seized the important post of Columbus on the 7th.A few days afterward
General Buckner moved north from Tennessee, and occupied Bowling Green.At the same time General Zollicoffer invaded the State from Cumberland
Gap.All three of these Confederate generals issued stirring addresses
to all true Kentuckians to rally to their support.It was confidently
expected by the Confederate authorities that there would be a general
uprising throughout the State in favor of the South.But they were
grievously disappointed; the effect was just the opposite.The
Legislature, then in session at Frankfort, passed a resolution
commanding the Governor to issue a proclamation ordering the
Confederates at once to evacuate the State.Governor Magoffin, much to
his chagrin, was obliged to issue the proclamation.A few days later the
Legislature voted that the State should raise a force of 40,000 men, and
that this force be tendered the United States for the purpose of putting
down rebellion.An invitation was also extended to General Anderson to
assume command of all these forces.Thus, to their chagrin, the
Confederates saw their brightest hopes perish.Instead of their getting
possession of the State, even neutrality had perished.The State was
irrevocably committed to the Union, but the people were as hopelessly
divided as ever.It was to be a battle to the death between the opposing
factions.Shortly after his return to Dick Robinson, Fred began to long to hear
from home, to know how those he loved fared; so he asked General Thomas
for a day or two of absence.It was readily granted, and soon he was on
his way to Danville.He found only his Uncle and Aunt Pennington at
home.His father had gone South to accept the colonelcy of a regiment,
and was with Buckner.His cousin Calhoun had accompanied Colonel
Shackelford South, having the promise of a position on the staff of some
general officer.His little sister Bessie had been sent to Cincinnati to
a convent school.The adherents of the opposing factions were more
bitter toward each other than ever, and were ready to spring at each
other's throats at the slightest provocation.Neighbors were estranged,
families were broken, nevermore to be reunited; and over all there
seemed to be hanging the black shadow of coming sorrow.Kentucky was not
only to be deluged in blood, but with the hot burning tears of those
left behind to groan and weep.Fred was received coldly by his uncle and aunt."You know," said Judge
Pennington, "my house is open to you, but I cannot help feeling the
keenest sorrow over your conduct.""I am sorry, very sorry, uncle, if what I have done has grieved you,"
answered Fred."No one can be really sorry who persists in his course," answered the
judge."Fred, rather--yes, a thousand times--had I rather see you dead
than doing as you are.If my brave boy falls," and his voice trembled as
he spoke, "I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that he fell in a
glorious cause.But you, Fred, you----" his voice broke; he could say no
more."Uncle," he softly said, "I admit you are honest
and sincere in your belief.Why can you not admit as much for me?Why is
it a disgrace to fight for the old flag, to defend the Union that
Washington and Jefferson helped form, and that Jackson defended?""The wrong," answered Judge Pennington, "consists in trying to coerce
sovereign States.The Constitution gives any State the right to withdraw
from the Union at pleasure.The South is fighting for her constitutional
rights----"

"And for human slavery," added Fred."Look out, Fred," he exclaimed, choking with passion, "lest I drive you
from my door, despite my promise to your father.You
are not only fighting against the South, but you are becoming a detested
Abolitionist--a <DW65> worshiper."Fred felt his manhood aroused, but controlling his passion he calmly
replied:

"Uncle, I will not displease you longer with my presence.The time may
come when you may need my help, instead of my needing yours.If so, do
not hesitate to call on me.I still love my kindred as well as ever;
they are as near to me as ever.There is no dishonor in a man loyally
following what he honestly believes to be right.I believe you and my
father to be wrong--that your sympathies have led you terribly astray;
but in my sight you are none the less true, noble, honest men.As for
me, I answer for myself.I am for the Union, now and forever.May God keep all of those we love from harm," and he rode away.Judge Pennington gazed after him with a troubled look, and then murmured
to himself: "After all, a fine boy, a grand boy!Upon Fred's return to headquarters he found General Thomas in deep
consultation with his staff.Circulars had been scattered all over the
State and notices printed in newspapers calling for a meeting of the
State Guards at Lexington on the 20th.Ostensibly the object of the
meeting was to be for a week's drill, and for the purpose of better
preparing the Guards to protect the interests of the State.But General
Thomas believed there was a hidden meaning in the call; that it was
conceived in deceit, and that it meant treachery.What this treachery
was he did not know, and it was this point he was discussing with his
staff when Fred entered.The sight of the boy brought a smile to his
face.he exclaimed, "I am glad to see you.We have a hard
problem; it is one rather in your line.He then laid the circular before Fred, and expressed his opinion that it
contained a hidden meaning."There is no end to those fellows'
plottings," he said, "and we are still weak, very weak here.With
General Zollicoffer moving this way from Cumberland Gap, it would not
take much of a force in our rear to cause a great disaster.In fact, a
hostile force at Lexington, even if small, would be a serious matter."Fred read the circular carefully, as if reading between the lines, and
then asked:

"It is the real meaning of this call that you wish?""By all means, if it can be obtained," answered the general."I will try to obtain it," replied Fred, quietly."General you may not
hear from me for two or three days.""May success attend you, my boy," replied the general, kindly, and with
this he dismissed his staff."It has come to a pretty pass," said a dapper young lieutenant of the
staff to an older member, "that the general prefers a boy to one of us,"
and he drew himself proudly up, as if to say, "Now, if the general had
detailed me, there might have been some hopes of success."The older member smiled, and answered: "I think it just as well,
Lieutenant, that he chose the boy.I don't think either you or me fitted
for that kind of work."Again a black-haired, dark-skinned boy left headquarters at Dick
Robinson, this time for Lexington.Arriving there, Fred took a room at
the leading hotel, registering as Charles Danford, Cincinnati, thinking
it best to take an entirely fictitious name.He soon learned that the
leading Southern sympathizers of the city were in the habit of meeting
in a certain room at the hotel.He kept very quiet, for there was one
man in Lexington he did not care to meet, and that man was Major
Hockoday.He knew that the major would recognize him as the boy he met
at Georgetown, and that meant the defeat of his whole scheme.Fred's
first step was to make friends with the chamber maid, a comely mulatto
girl.This he did with a bit of flattery and a generous tip.By adroit
questioning, he learned that the girl had charge of the room in which
the meetings of the conspirators were held.Could she in any manner secrete him in the room during one of the
meetings?"No, youn' massa, no!""Not fo' fiv' 'undred," answered the girl."Massa kill me, if he foun'
it out."Fred saw that she could not be bribed; he would have to try a new tack."See here, Mary," he asked, "you would like to be free, would you not,
just like a white girl?""Yes, massa, I woul' like dat.""You have heard of President Lincoln, have you not?"The girl's eyes lit up with a sudden fire."Yes, Massa Linkun good; he
want to free we 'uns.All de <DW65>s talkin' 'bout dat.""Mary, I am a friend of Lincoln.The
men who meet in that room are his enemies."I am here trying to find out their plans, so we can keep them from
killing Mr.Mary, you must help me, or you will be blamed for
what may happen, and you will never be free.""Massa will whip me to death, if he foun' it
out," she blubbered."Your master will never find it out, even if I am discovered, for I will
never tell on you.""Yes; I will swear it on the Bible."Like most of her race, the girl was very superstitious, and had great
reverence for the Bible.She went and brought one, and with his hand on
the book Fred took a most solemn oath never to betray her--no, not if he
was torn to pieces with red-hot pincers.Along toward night she came and whispered to Fred that she had been
told to place the room in order.There was, she said, but one place to
hide, and that was behind a large sofa, which stood across one corner of
the room.It was a perilous hiding place, but Fred resolved to risk it."They can but kill me," thought he, "and I had almost as soon die as
fail."It was getting dark when Mary unlocked the door of the room and let Fred
slip in.He found that by lying close to the sofa, he might escape
detection, though one should glance over the top.The minutes passed like hours to the excited boy.The slightest noise
startled him, and he found himself growing nervous, and in spite of all
his efforts, a slight tremor shook his limbs.At last he heard
foot-falls along the hall, the door was unlocked, and some one entered
the room.It was the landlord, who lit the gas, looked carefully around,
and went out.Fred's nervousness was all
gone; but his heart beat so loudly that he thought it must be heard.It
was a notable gathering of men distinguished not only in State but
national affairs.Chief among them was John C. Breckinridge, as knightly
and courteous as ever; then there were Colonel Humphrey Marshall, John
H. Morgan, Colonel Preston, and a score of others.These men had
gathered for the purpose of dragging Kentucky out of the Union over the
vote of her citizens, and in spite of her loyal Legislature.In their
zeal they threw to the winds their own beloved doctrine of State
rights, and would force Kentucky into the Southern Confederacy whether
she wanted to go or not.They believed the South was right, that it was their duty to defend her,
and that any means were lawful to bring about the desired end.Fred, as he lay in his hiding place, hardly dared to breathe.Once his
heart ceased to beat when he heard Morgan say: "There is room behind
that sofa for one to hide."Colonel Marshall glanced behind it, and said: "There is no one there."Then they commenced to talk, and Fred lay and listened to the whole
plot.The State Guards were to assemble, professedly, as the circular
stated, for muster and drill, but really for one of the most daring of
_coups-de-main_.The State arsenal at Frankfort was to be taken by surprise, and the arms
secured.The loyal Legislature was then to be dispersed at the point of
the bayonet, a provisional Legislature organized, and the State voted
out of the Union.The force was then to attack Camp Dick Robinson, in
conjunction with General Zollicoffer, who was to move up from Cumberland
Gap; and between the two forces it was thought the camp would fall an
easy prey.In the mean time, Buckner was to make a dash for Louisville
from Bowling Green.If he failed to take it by surprise, all the forces
were to join and capture it, thus placing the whole State in the control
of the Confederates.It was a bold, but admirably conceived plan.Breckinridge pointed out that the plan was
feasible.He said the ball once started, thousands of Kentuckians would
spring to arms all over the State.The plan was earnestly discussed and
fully agreed to.The work of each man was carefully mapped out, and
every detail carefully arranged.At last the meeting was over, and the
company began to pass out.He had succeeded; the full details of
the plot were in his possession.Waiting until all were well out of the
room, he crawled from his hiding place, and passed out.But he had
exulted too soon in his success.He had scarcely taken three steps from
the door before he came face to face with Major Hockoday, who was
returning for something he had forgotten."Now I have you, you young imp of Satan,"
and he made a grab for his collar.But Fred was as quick and lithe as a
cat, and eluding the major's clutch, he gave him such a blow in the face
that it staggered him against the wall.Before he recovered from the
effects of the blow Fred had disappeared.gasped the Major, and he made a grab for his
collar.]The major's face was
covered with blood, and he truly presented a gory appearance.It was
some time before the excitement subsided so the major could tell his
story.It was that a young villain had assaulted and attempted to murder
him.By his description, the landlord at once identified the boy as the
one who occupied room 45.But a search revealed the fact that the bird
had flown.It was also ascertained that the major had received no
serious injury.By request of the major the meeting was hastily re-convened.There, in
its privacy, he gave the true history of the attempted murder, as the
guests of the hotel thought it.The major expressed his opinion that the
boy was a spy.He was sure it was the same boy he had met in the hotel
at Georgetown."You know," he said, "that the landlord at Georgetown
found a hole drilled through the plastering of the room that this boy
occupied, into the one which was occupied by me and in which we held a
meeting.I tell you, the boy is a first-class spy, and I would not be
surprised if he was concealed somewhere in this room during the
meeting."cried several voices, but nevertheless a
number of faces grew pale."There is no place he could hide in this room, except behind the sofa,
and I looked there," said Marshall."Gentlemen," said the landlord, "this room is kept locked."All I know," said the major, "I met him about three paces from the
door, just as I turned the corner.When I attempted to stop him, he
suddenly struck the blow and disappeared.If it was not for his black
hair, I should be more than ever convinced that the boy was Fred
Shackelford.""In league with the devil, probably," growled Captain Conway."For if
there was ever one of his imps on earth, it's that Shackelford boy.Curse him, I will be even with him yet.""And so will I," replied the major, gently feeling of his swollen nose."Gentlemen," said John H. Morgan, "this is no time for idle regrets.Whether that boy has heard anything or not, we cannot tell.But from
what Major Hockoday has said, there is no doubt but that he is a spy.His assault on the major and fleeing show that.So it behooves us to be
careful.I have a trusty agent at Nicholasville, who keeps me fully
informed of all that transpires there.I will telegraph him particulars,
and have him be on the watch for such a boy."It was an uneasy crowd that separated that night.It looked as if one
boy might bring to naught all their well-laid plans.The next morning Morgan received the following telegram from
Nicholasville:


     JOHN H. MORGAN:

     Early this morning a black-haired, dark-skinned boy, riding a jaded
     horse, came in on the Lexington pike.Without stopping for
     refreshments he left his horse, and procured a fresh one, which the
     same boy left here a couple of days ago, and rode rapidly away in
     the direction of Camp Dick Robinson."I must put all the boys on their
guard."Late in the afternoon of the 19th the following telegram was received by
Morgan from Nicholasville:


     JOHN H. MORGAN:

     Colonel Bramlette with his regiment has just forcibly taken
     possession of a train of cars, and will at once start for
     Lexington.That night Breckinridge, Marshall, Morgan and half a score of others
fled from Lexington.Their plottings had come to naught; instead of
their bright visions of success, they were fugitives from their homes.It would have fared ill with that black-haired boy if they could have
got hold of him just then.When Fred escaped from Major Hockoday, he lost no time in making his way
to the home of one of the most prominent Union men of Lexington.Telling
him he had most important dispatches for General Thomas, a horse was
procured, and through the darkness of the night Fred rode to
Nicholasville, reaching there early in the morning.Leaving his tired
horse, and taking his own, which he had left there, he rode with all
speed to Camp Dick Robinson, and made his report to General Thomas.He warmly congratulated
Fred, saying it was a wonderful piece of work."Let's see," said he,
"this is the 16th.I do not want to scare them, as I wish to make a fine
haul, take them right in their treasonable acts.It's the only way I can
make the government believe it.On the 19th I will send Colonel
Bramlette with his regiment with orders to capture the lot.I will also
have to guard against the advance of General Zollicoffer.As for the
advance of General Buckner on Louisville, that is out of my department.""And there," said Fred, "is where our greatest danger lies.Louisville
is so far north they are careless, forgetting that Buckner has a
railroad in good repair on which to transport his men."answered Fred, and then he asked for a map.After studying it
for some time, he turned to Thomas and said:

"General, I have a favor to ask.I would like a leave of absence for a
week.I have an idea I want to work out."Thomas sat looking at the boy a moment, and then said: "It is nothing
rash, is it, my boy?""No more so than what I have done," answered Fred."In fact, I don't
know that I will do anything.It is only an idea I want to work on; it
may be all wrong.That is the reason I can't explain it to you.""You are not going to enter the enemy's lines as a spy, are you?You are too young and too valuable to risk your life that
way.""No, General, at least I trust not.The rebels will have to get much
farther north than they are now if I enter their lines, even if I carry
out my idea.""Very well, Fred; you have my consent, but be very careful.""I shall try to be so, General.I only hope that the suspicions I have
are groundless, and my journey will prove a pleasure trip."Thus saying, Fred bade the general good day, and early the next morning
he rode away, taking the road to Danville.Fred did not stop in Danville; instead, he avoided the main street, so
as to be seen by as few of his acquaintances as possible.He rode
straight on to Lebanon before he stopped.Here he put up for the night,
giving himself and his horse a good rest.The country was in such a
disturbed condition that every stranger was regarded with suspicion, and
forced to answer a multitude of questions.Fred did not escape, and to
all he gave the same answer, that he was from Danville, and that he was
on his way to Elizabethtown to visit his sick grandfather.He was especially interested
in Prince, examining him closely, and remarking he was one of the finest
horses he ever saw.Fred learned that the man's name was Mathews, that
he was a horse dealer, and was also a violent sympathizer with the
South.He was also reputed to be something of a bully.Fred thought some
of his questions rather impertinent, and gave rather short answers,
which did not seem to please Mathews.Leaving Lebanon early the next morning, he rode nearly west, it being
his intention to strike the Louisville and Nashville railroad a little
south of Elizabethtown.It was a beautiful September day, and as Fred
cantered along, he sang snatches of songs, and felt merrier and happier
than at any time since that sad parting with his father.And he thought of that strange
oath which bound Calhoun and himself together, and wondered what would
come of it all.But what was uppermost in his mind was the object of his
present journey.Was there anything in it, or was it a fool's errand?As he was riding along a country road, pondering these
things, it suddenly occurred to him that the landscape appeared
familiar.He reined up his horse, and looked around.The fields
stretching away before him, the few trees, and above all a tumbled down,
half-ruined log hut.Yet he knew he had never
been there before.Could he have seen this in a dream
sometime?The more he looked, the more familiar it seemed; and the more
he was troubled.A countryman came along riding a raw-boned spavined horse; a rope served
for a bridle, and an old coffee sack strapped on the sharp back of the
horse took the place of a saddle.Having no stirrups, the countryman's
huge feet hung dangling down and swung to and fro, like two weights tied
to a string; a dilapidated old hat, through whose holes stuck tufts of
his bleached tow hair, adorned his head."Stranger, you 'uns 'pears to be interested," he remarked to Fred, as
he reined in his steed, and at the same time ejected about a pint of
tobacco juice from his capacious mouth."Yes," answered Fred, "this place seems to be very familiar--one that I
have seen many times; yet to my certain knowledge, I have never been
here before."Seen it in a picter, I reckon," drawled the countryman."Nothin', stranger, only they do say the picter of that air blamed old
shanty is every whar up No'th.I don't see anything
great in it.I wish it war sunk before he war born.""Why, man, what do you mean?replied the native, expectorating at a stone in the road, and
hitting it fairly."I mean that the gol-all-fir'-est, meanest cuss that
ever lived war born thar, the man what's making war on the South, and
wants to put the <DW65>s ekal to us.Abe Lincoln, drat him, war born in
that ole house."This then was the lowly birthplace of
the man whose name was in the mouths of millions.How mean, how poor it
looked, and yet to what a master mind it gave birth!The life of
Lincoln had possessed a peculiar fascination for Fred, and during the
presidential campaign of the year before the picture of his birthplace
had been a familiar one to him.He now understood why the place looked
so familiar.It was like looking on the face of one he had carefully
studied in a photograph."Reckon you are a stranger, or you would have knowed the place?""Yes, I am a stranger," answered Fred."Then this is the place where the
President of the United States was born?""Yes, an' it war a po' day for ole Kentuck when he war born.Oughter to
ha' died, the ole Abolitioner."Fred smiled, "Well," he said, "I must be going.I am very much obliged
to you for your information.""Don't mention it, stranger, don't mention it.Say, that's a mighty fine
hoss you air ridin'; look out or some of them fellers scootin' round the
country will get him.Times mighty ticklish, stranger, mighty ticklish.and he extended a huge roll of Kentucky
twist."No, thank you," responded Fred, and bidding the countryman good day, he
rode away leaving him in the road staring after him, and muttering:
"Mighty stuck up!Wonder if he aint one of them
Abolitioners!"It was the middle of the afternoon when Fred struck the railroad at a
small station a few miles south of Elizabethtown.There was a crowd
around the little depot, and Fred saw that they were greatly excited.Hitching his horse, he mingled with the throng, and soon learned that
the train from the south was overdue several hours.To add to the
mystery, all telegraphic communication with the south had been severed.Strike the instrument as often as he might, the operator could get no
response."It's mighty queer," said an intelligent looking man."There is mischief
up the road of some kind.Here Louisville has been telegraphing like mad
for hours, and can't get a reply beyond this place."Here the operator came out and announced that telegraphic communication
had also been severed on the north."We are entirely cut off," he said.We will have
to wait and see what's the matter, that's all."Just then away to the south a faint tinge of smoke was seen rising, and
the cry was raised that a train was coming.The excitement arose to
fever heat, and necks were craned, and eyes strained to catch the first
glimpse of the train.At length its low rumbling could be heard, and
when at last it hove in sight, it was seen to be a very heavy one.Slowly it drew up to the station, and to the surprise of the lookers-on
it was loaded down with soldiers.shouted the soldiers, and the crowd took up
the cry.It was Buckner's army from Bowling Green en route for
Louisville by train, hoping thereby to take the place completely by
surprise.Telegraphic communications
all along the line had been severed by trusty agents; the Federal
authorities at Louisville were resting in fancied security; the city was
lightly guarded.In fancy, he heard his name
on every tongue, and heard himself called the greatest military genius
of the country.When the crowd caught the full meaning of the movement,
cheer after cheer made the welkin ring.They grasped the soldiers'
hands, and bade them wipe the Yankees from the face of the earth.This was the idea of which he
spoke to General Thomas.He had an impression that General Buckner might
attempt to do just what he was now doing.It was the hope of thwarting
the movement, if made, that had led Fred to make the journey.His
impressions had proven true; he was on the ground, but how to stop the
train was now the question.He had calculated on plenty of time, that he
could find out when the train was due, and plan his work accordingly.In a moment or two it would be gone, and
with it all opportunity to stop it.If
anything was done, it must be done quickly.The entire population of
the little village was at the depot; there was little danger of his
being noticed.Dashing into a blacksmith shop he secured a sledge; then
mounting his horse, he rode swiftly to the north.About half a mile from
the depot there was a curve in the track which would hide him from
observation.Jumping Prince over the low fence which guarded the
railroad, in a few seconds he was at work with the sledge trying to
batter out the spikes which held a rail in position.His face was pale,
his teeth set.Great drops of perspiration stood
out on his forehead, and his blows rang out like the blows of a giant.The train whistled; it was ready to start.Between his strokes he could hear the clang of the bell, the
parting cheers of the crowd.The heads of the
spikes flew off; they were driven in and the plates smashed.One end of
a rail was loosened; it was driven in a few inches.The deed was done,
and none too soon.So busy was Fred that he had not noticed that two men on horseback had
ridden up to the fence, gazed at him a moment in astonishment, then
shouted in anger, and dismounted.Snatching a revolver from his pocket,
Fred sent a ball whistling by their ears, and yelled: "Back!Jumping on their horses quicker than they dismounted, they galloped
toward the approaching train, yelling and wildly gesticulating.The
engineer saw them, but it was before the day of air brakes, and it was
impossible to stop the heavy train.The engine plunged off the track,
tore up the ground and ties for a few yards, and then turned over on its
side, where it lay spouting smoke and steam, and groaning like a thing
of life.It lay partly across the track, thus completely blocking it.The engineer and fireman had jumped, and so slowly was the train running
that the cars did not leave the track.For this Fred was devoutly
thankful.He had accomplished his object, and no one had been injured.Jumping on his horse, he gave a shout of triumph and rode away.But the frightened soldiers had been pouring from the cars.The two men
on horseback were pointing at Fred and yelling: "There!there goes the
villain who did it."thundered a colonel who had just sprung out of the
foremost car.Fred's horse, was seen to stumble
slightly; the boy swayed, and leaned forward in his seat; but quickly
recovering himself, he turned around and waving his hat shouted
defiance.thundered a Colonel who had just sprung out
of the foremost car.]"That is Fred Shackelford, and
that horse is Prince."The colonel
who had given the order to fire turned pale, staggered and would have
fallen if one of his officers had not caught him."I ordered my men to fire on my own son."The officers gathered around General Buckner, who stood looking at the
wrecked engine with hopeless despair pictured in every feature.His
visions of glory had vanished, as it were, in a moment.No plaudits from
an admiring world, no "Hail!Utter failure
was the end of the movement for which he had hoped so much.It would take hours to clear away the wreck.He groaned
in the agony of his spirit, and turned away.His officers stood by in
silence; his sorrow was too great for words of encouragement.Colonel Shackelford tottered up
to General Buckner, pale as death, and trembling in every limb."General," he gasped, "it was my boy, my son who did this.I am unworthy
to stand in your presence for bringing such a son into the world.Cashier me, shoot me if you will.The soul of the man who refused to desert his soldiers at Fort Donelson,
when those in command above him fled, who afterwards helped bear General
Grant to his tomb, with a heart as tender as that of a woman, now
asserted itself.His own terrible disappointment was forgotten in the
sorrow of his friend.Grasping the hand of Colonel Shackelford, he said
with the deepest emotion:

"Colonel, not a soldier will hold you responsible.This is a struggle
in which the noblest families are divided.If this deed had been for the
South instead of the North, you would be the proudest man in the
Confederacy.Can we not see the bravery, the heroism of the deed, even
though it has dashed our fondest hopes to the ground, shattered and
broken?No, Colonel, I shall not accept your resignation.I know you
will be as valiant for the South, as your son has been for the North."Tears gushed from Colonel Shackelford's eyes; he endeavored to speak,
but his tongue refused to express his feelings.The officers, although
bowed down with disappointment, burst into a cheer, and there was not
one who did not feel prouder of their general in his disappointment than
if he had been successful.General Thomas had warned
General Anderson, who had moved his headquarters to that city, that
General Buckner was contemplating an advance.But it was thought that he
would come with waving banners and with the tramp of a great army, and
that there would be plenty of time to prepare for him.Little did they
think he would try to storm the city with a train of cars, and be in
their midst before they knew it.When the train was delayed and
telegraphic communications severed, it was thought that some accident
had happened.There was not the slightest idea of the true state of
affairs.As hours passed and nothing was heard of the delayed train, a
train of discovery was sent south to find out what was the matter.This
train ran into Buckner's advance at Elizabethtown, and was seized.Not hearing anything from this train, an engine was sent after it.Still
there was no idea of what had happened, no preparations to save
Louisville.This engine ran into Buckner's advance at Muldraugh Hill.The fireman was a loyal man and at once grasped the situation.He leaped
from his engine and ran back.What could this one man do, miles from
Louisville, and on foot!Meeting some section hands
with a handcar, he shouted: "Back!the road above is swarming with
rebels."Great streams of perspiration ran down their
bodies; their breath came in gasps, and still the fireman shouted: "Work
her lively, boys, for God's sake, work her lively!"At last Louisville was reached, and for the first time the facts known.Once
more the devoted Home Guards, the men who saved the city from riot and
bloodshed on July 22d, sprang to arms.General Rousseau was ordered from
across the river.These, with the Home Guards,
made a force of nearly 3,000 men.These men were hurried on board the
cars, and sent forward under the command of General W. T. Sherman.Through the darkness of the night this train felt its way.On reaching
Rolling Fork of Salt River the bridge was found to be burnt.Despairing
of reaching Louisville, General Buckner had destroyed the bridge to
delay the advance of the Federal troops.But how many American boys and girls know the name
of the daring young man who tore up the track, or the brave fireman who
brought back the news?[A]

But how was it with Fred; had he escaped unhurt from that volley?The stumble of his horse was caused by stepping into a hole, yet slight
as the incident was, it saved Fred's life, for it threw him slightly
forward, and at the same moment a ball tore through the crown of his
hat.Another ball struck the crupper of his saddle, and another one
bored a hole through Prince's right ear.As soon as he was out of sight Fred stopped, and, ascertaining that no
damage had been done, excepting the perforating of Prince's ear and his
hat, he patted his horse's neck and said: "Ah, Prince, old boy, you are
marked now for life, but it is all right.I shall always know you by
that little hole through your ear."Fred stopped that night at a planter's house, who at first viewed him
with some suspicion; but when he was told of Buckner's advance, he was
so overjoyed, being an ardent Secessionist, that there was nothing good
enough for his guest.The next day, when Fred rode into Lebanon, the first man that he saw
was Mathews, who sauntered up to him, and said in a sarcastic tone: "It
seems, young man, that you made a short visit to your poor sick
grandfather."I didn't
see the old gentleman; I concluded to come back.Things are getting a
little too brisk up there for me.Buckner has advanced, and there may be
some skirmishing around Elizabethtown.""And so you run," exclaimed Mathews in a tone which made Fred's blood
boil.All of this time Mathews had been carefully looking over the boy
and horse, and quite a crowd had collected around them.continued Mathews; "a round hole through your horse's ear, been
bleeding, too; your saddle torn by a bullet, and a hole through your
hat.Boy, you had better give an account of yourself.""Not at your command," replied Fred, hotly."And I deny your right to
question me.""You do, do you, my fine young fellow?I will show you," and he made a
grab for Prince's bridle.A sharp, quick word from Fred, and the horse sprang, overthrowing
Mathews, and scattering the crowd right and left.Mathews arose, shaking
the dust from his clothes and swearing like a trooper.A fine-looking man had just ridden up to the crowd as the incident
occurred.He looked after the flying boy, and nervously fingered the
revolver in his holster.Then a smile came over his face, and he spoke
to Mathews, who was still swearing and loudly calling for a horse to
pursue Fred."No use, Jim; you might as well chase a streak of lightning.That is the
fastest horse in Kentucky."Mathews looked at the man a moment in surprise, and then exclaimed:
"Heavens!"Made a run for it night before last," replied Morgan with a laugh, "to
keep from being nabbed by old Thomas.But what was the fuss between you
and that boy?I wonder what he was doing out here any way?But, Mathews,
he did upset you nicely; I think you rolled over at least six times.""I will be even with him yet," growled Mathews.I have heard half a dozen men say that, myself included.But let's
hear what the rumpus was about."When Morgan heard the story, he said: "So Buckner is at Elizabethtown,
is he?I was going to Bowling Green, but now
I will change my course to Elizabethtown.But I would like to know what
that boy has been doing.From what you say he must have been in a
skirmish.Trying to throw a train off the track, perhaps; it would be
just like him.""But, Mathews," he continued, "the boy is gone, so let us talk
business.I am going to raise a regiment of cavalry for the Confederate
service, and I want you to raise a company.""That I will, John," said Mathews."There is no other man I had rather
ride under."Fred laughed heartily as he looked back and saw Mathews shaking the dust
from himself.Finding that he was not pursued he brought Prince down to
a walk."I could almost swear," he said to himself, "that I caught a
glimpse of Morgan as I dashed through the crowd.Thomas surely ought to
have him before this time.As he was riding through Danville he met his uncle, Judge Pennington,
who, to his surprise, greeted him most cordially, and would insist on
his stopping a while."Over towards Elizabethtown to see my sick grandfather," replied Fred,
gravely.asked his uncle, somewhat nettled."Well, uncle, I have been over towards Elizabethtown ostensibly to see
my grandfather, but really to see what I could find over there.""I found Buckner's men as thick as hops, and I found a warm reception
besides.Look here," and he showed his uncle the hole through his hat."If you will go out and look at Prince, you will find a hole through
his ear, and you will also find the saddle torn with a bullet.Oh, yes,
Buckner's men were glad to see me; they gave me a warm reception.""Oh, I side-tracked one of their trains.""Fred," said he, "you are engaging in
dangerous business.I have heard of
some of your doings."Then it was he I saw at Lebanon."Because--because--I thought--I thought he was in Lexington.""It was because," answered the judge, severely, "that you thought he was
a prisoner at Camp Dick Robinson.Ah, Fred, you were not as sharp as you
thought.You foiled their plans; but, thank God!All pretense of neutrality is now at an
end.These men will now be found in the ranks, fighting for the liberty
of the South.As for Morgan, he will be heard from, mark my word.""He is a daring fellow, and sharp,
too; yes, I believe he will be heard from.""Fred, Morgan thinks you have had more to do with finding out their
plans than any other one person.""Morgan does me too much honor," replied Fred, quietly.The judge remained quiet for a moment, and then said: "My boy, I wish
you could have seen Morgan before you had so thoroughly committed
yourself to the other side.He
believes if he could talk with you, you might be induced to change your
mind.He says in the kind of work in which he expects to engage, you
would be worth a brigade of men.Fred, will you, will you not think of
this?You are breaking our hearts with your course now.""Dear uncle," replied Fred, "I thank Morgan for his good opinion, and I
reciprocate his opinion; for of all the men I have met, I believe he,
most of all, has the elements of a dashing, successful leader.But as
for his offer, I cannot consider it for a moment."The judge sighed, and Fred saw that his further presence was not
desirable, so he made his adieus, and rode away.Morgan wants to win me over," thought Fred, "and that was the
reason uncle was so nice.I think this last scrape has burnt the bridges
between us, and they will trouble me no more."Fred made his report to General Thomas, who heard it with evident
satisfaction."This, then, was your idea, Fred?""Yes, General, I in some way conceived the notion that Buckner would try
to surprise Louisville just as he did try to do.I knew that trains were
running regularly between Nashville and Louisville, and thought that a
surprise could be effected.But the idea was so vague I was ashamed to
tell you, for fear of exciting ridicule.So, I got my leave of absence
and stole off, and if nothing had come of it, no one would have been the
wiser."General Thomas smiled, and said: "It was an idea worthy of a great
general, Fred.General Anderson has much to thank you for, as well as
the people of Louisville.But you must take a good rest now, both you
and your horse.From appearances, I think it will not be many days
before General Zollicoffer will give us plenty to do."FOOTNOTE:

[A] The name of the gallant young man who tore up the track was
Crutcher; the author does not know the name of the fireman.On October 7th General Anderson, at his own request, was relieved of the
command of the Department of Kentucky, on account of continued
ill-health.The next day General W. T. Sherman, a man destined to fill
an important place in the history of the war, was appointed to the
position.Both the Federal and the Confederate governments had now
thrown aside all pretense of neutrality.Kentucky echoed to the martial
tread of armed men.At Maysville under General Nelson, at Camp Dick Robinson under General
Thomas, at Louisville under General Sherman, and at Paducah under
General Grant, the Federal government was gathering its hosts; while the
Confederate government with its troops occupied Columbus, Bowling Green,
Cumberland Gap, and the mountains of eastern Kentucky.General Albert
Sydney Johnston, one of the ablest of the Confederate generals, was in
supreme command, with headquarters at Bowling Green.General Zollicoffer marched from Cumberland Gap early in the month, and
assumed offensive operations.When General Sherman took command, Fred was sent by General Thomas to
Louisville with dispatches.General Sherman had heard of some of the
exploits of the young messenger, and he was received very kindly.Sherman, at that time, was in the prime of life.Straight as an arrow,
of commanding presence, he was every inch a soldier.He was quick and
impulsive in his actions, and to Fred seemed to be a bundle of nerves.In conversation he was open and frank and expressed his opinion freely,
in this resembling General Nelson.But the rough, overbearing nature of
Nelson he entirely lacked.He was one of the most courteous of men.He would have Fred tell of some of his exploits, and when he gave an
account of his first journey to Louisville, and his adventure with
Captain Conway, the general was greatly pleased.Fred's account of how
he discovered the details of the plot at Lexington was received with
astonishment, and he was highly complimented.But the climax came when
he told of how he had thrown the train from the track, and thus brought
Buckner's intended surprise to naught.The general jumped up, grasped
Fred's hand, and exclaimed:

"That, young man, calls for a commission, if I can get you one, and I
think I can.""General," replied Fred, "I thank you very much, but I do not wish a
commission.It is true, I am hired
privately by General Nelson, and if I understand rightly I am getting
the pay of a lieutenant; but I am not bound by oath to serve any length
of time, neither could I have accomplished what I have if I had been a
regular enlisted soldier.""But remember, if you are ever in
need of any favor, do not hesitate to call on me."This Fred readily promised, and left the general, highly elated over the
interview.Before leaving Louisville, Fred did not forget to call on the Vaughns.He found Miss Mabel well, and he thought her more beautiful than ever.A
sad, pensive look on her face but added to her loveliness.Only the day
before she had bidden her betrothed farewell, and he had marched to the
front to help fight the battles of his country.As she hung weeping
around his neck, he pointed to a little miniature flag pinned on his
breast--it was the same flag that Mabel wore on that day she was beset
by the mob--and said:

"Dearest, it shall be worn there as long as my heart beats.Never shall
it be touched by a traitorous hand as long as I live.Every time I look
upon it, it will be an incentive to prove worthy of the brave girl who
wore it on her breast in the face of a brutal mob."Then with one fond clasp of the hands, one long lingering kiss, he was
gone; and to Mabel all the light and joy of the world seemed to go with
him.But the coming of Fred brought new thoughts, and for the time her eyes
grew brighter, her cheeks rosier and laugh happier.The bright, brave
boy who saved her from the mob was very welcome, and to her he was only
a boy, a precious, darling boy.They made Fred relate his adventures, and one minute Mabel's eyes would
sparkle with fun, and the next melt in tenderness.In spite of himself,
Fred's heart beat very fast, he hardly knew why.But when he told with
trembling voice how he had parted from his father, and how he had been
disowned and driven from home, the sympathy of the impulsive girl
overcame her, and with eyes swimming in tears, she arose, threw her arms
around him, imprinted a kiss on his forehead, and murmured: "Poor boy!Then turning to her mother, she said, "We will adopt him,
won't we, mother, and I will have a brother."Then remembering what she had done, she retired blushing and in
confusion to her seat.That kiss finished Fred; it thrilled him through
and through.Yet somehow the thought of being a brother to Mabel didn't
give him any satisfaction.He knew Mabel looked upon him as only a boy,
and the thought made him angry, but the next moment he was ashamed of
himself.He took his leave, promising to call the next time he was in
the city, and went away with conflicting emotions.Fred was really suffering from an attack of first love, and didn't know
it.It was better for him that he didn't, for it was the sooner
forgotten.On his return to Camp Dick Robinson Fred found that General Thomas had
advanced some of his troops toward Cumberland Gap.Colonel Garrard was
occupying an exposed position on the Rock Castle Hills, and Fred was
sent to him with dispatches.Fred found the little command in
considerable doubt over the movements of General Zollicoffer.One hour
the rumor would be that he was advancing, and the next hour would bring
the story that he was surely retreating.Colonel Garrard feared that he
would be attacked with a greatly superior force.Fred resolved that he would do a little scouting on his own account.Colonel Garrard offered to send a small party with him, but Fred
declined the offer, saying that a squad would only attract attention,
and if he ran into danger he would trust to the fleetness of his horse
to save him.Riding east, he made a wide detour, and at last came to where he thought
he must be near the enemy's lines.In his front was a fine plantation;
near by, in the woods, some <DW64>s were chopping.These <DW64>s he
resolved to interview.His appearance created great consternation, and
some of them dropped their axes, and looked as if about to run."Don't be afraid, boys," said Fred, kindly."I only want to know who
lives in yonder house.""Not now, sah; he down to Zollicoffer camp.""Oh, then General Zollicoffer is camped near here?""Yes, sah; 'bout two mile down de road.""Do any of the soldiers ever come this way?""Yes, sah; 'bout twenty went up de road not mo' than two hours ago.Den
a capin man, he cum to see Missy Alice most ebber day.""Thank you," said Fred, as he rode away."I think I will pay a visit to
Missy Alice myself."Riding boldly up to the house, he dismounted.Before entering the house
he accosted an old <DW64> who was working in the yard, and slipping a
dollar into his hand, said:

"Uncle, if you see any one coming either way, will you cry, 'Massa, your
horse is getting away?'""Trus' me fo' dat," said the old man, grinning from ear to ear."I jess
make dat hoss jump, and den I yell, 'Massa, hoss gittin' way.'""That's it, uncle, you are all right," and Fred turned and went into the
house, where he introduced himself as a Mr.He
had friends in Zollicoffer's army, and had run the gauntlet of the
Federal lines to visit them.Could they tell him how far it was to
General Zollicoffer's camp.The ladies received him coldly, but told him the distance.But Fred was
not to be repulsed.He was a good talker, and he tried his best.He told
them the news of the outside world, and what the Yankees were doing, and
how they would soon be driven from the State.This at once endeared him
to the ladies, especially the younger, who was a most pronounced little
rebel.Miss Alice was a comely girl, somewhere between twenty and
twenty-five years of age, and by a little but well directed flattery
Fred completely won her confidence.She inquired after some
acquaintances in Lexington, and by a happy coincidence Fred knew them,
and the conversation became animated.At length Fred remarked: "I hope it will not be long before General
Zollicoffer will advance.We are getting anxious up at Lexington; we
want to see the Yankees driven into the Ohio.""You will not have to wait long," replied the girl."Captain Conway
tells me they are about ready, and will advance on the 20th or 21st----"
she stopped suddenly, bit her lip, and looked scared.In all probability she had told something that Captain Conway had told
her to keep secret.Fred did not appear to notice her confusion, and at
once said: "Conway, Conway, Captain Conway.Is it Captain P. C. Conway
of whom you speak?""Yes, sir," replied the girl, brightening up."Why, I know him, know him like a book; in fact, we are old
friends--special friends, I may say.He would rejoice to find me here,"
and then he added mentally, "and cut my throat.""A brilliant soldier, and a brave one, is Captain Conway," continued
Fred, "and if he is given an opportunity to distinguish himself, it will
not be long before it will be Major or Colonel Conway."This praise pleased Miss Alice greatly, and she informed Fred that he
would soon have the pleasure of meeting his friend; that she expected
him every moment.Fred moved somewhat uneasily in his chair.He had no desire to meet
Captain Conway, and he was about to make an excuse of going out to see
how his horse was standing, when they were startled by the old <DW64>
running toward the house and yelling at the top of his voice: "Massa,
massa, yo' hoss is gittin' away."The sly old fellow had thrown a stone at Prince, and the horse was
rearing and plunging.Fred dashed out of the house; a party of horsemen was coming up the
road, in fact, was nearly to the house.It was but the work of a moment
for Fred to unhitch his horse and vault into the saddle, but the party
was now not more than fifty yards away.They had noticed the horse hitched at the gate, and were coming at full
speed to try and surprise the owner.The moment Conway saw Fred he knew
him.he cried, "Fred Shackelford, what luck!"and snatched a pistol
from the holster and fired.The ball whistled past Fred's head
harmlessly, and he turned in the saddle and returned the fire.It was
the first time he had ever shot at a man, and even in the heat of
excitement he experienced a queer sensation, a sinking of the heart, as
though he were committing a crime.Fairly and squarely the ball from his revolver struck the horse of
Captain Conway in the forehead, and the animal fell dead, the rider
rolling in the dust.His men stopped the pursuit, and,
dismounting, gathered around the captain, thinking he was killed.But he sprang to his feet, shouting: "A hundred dollars to the one who
will take that young devil, dead or alive.Here, Corporal Smith, you
have a fleet horse, let me take him," and jumping into the saddle, he
was in pursuit, followed by all his men, except Corporal Smith, who
stood in the road looking after them.asked the two ladies, who stood
on the veranda, wringing their hands, and very much excited."Blamed if I know," answered the corporal."The sight of that young chap
seemed to make the captain kinder crazy.The moment he caught sight of
him, he called him by name, and banged away at him.""You say the captain called him by name?""Well, he said he knew the captain, and that he was one of his best
friends.The corporal had no explanation to offer, so went and took a look at the
captain's horse.In the meantime the pursued and the pursuers had passed out of sight up
the road, enveloped in a cloud of dust."Remember, boys," shouted Conway, "a hundred dollars to the one who
brings him down.But it was nothing but play for Fred to distance them, and he laughed to
think that they expected to catch him.But the laugh suddenly died on
his lips; he turned pale, and glanced hurriedly to the right and left.A
high rail fence ran on each side of the road.The scouting party of
which the <DW64>s spoke was returning.Captain Conway saw the other party, and shouted in triumph."Now, boys, we have him," and he spurred his horse forward, revolver in
hand.There was a look of malignant hatred on his face, and he muttered:
"Now, my boy, I will settle scores with you.I shall never take you back
to camp.'Captured a spy, killed while trying to escape.'As for Fred, even in his extremity, his courage or his presence of mind
never deserted him.He felt that to be captured by Conway was death, for
had not the captain sworn to kill him on sight?His mind was made up; he
would wheel and charge the captain's party.Just as he was about to do this, he espied an opening in the
fence on the left.As quick as thought he dashed through it, thinking it
might afford a chance of escape.The field
was a perfect cul-de-sac, bounded on all sides by a high rail fence, the
only opening the one he had come through.Through this opening the enemy poured, and when they saw the trap which
Fred had entered, their shouts made the welkin ring.Their shouts rang in Fred's ears like the tolling of a
funeral bell.So must the bay of hounds sound in the ears of the hunted
quarry.It was built of heavy rails, and
full seven feet high.Bending over his horse's
neck, Fred said: "Prince, it is a question of life or death.Do your
best, old fellow; we can but fail."With
distended nostrils, eyes flashing with excitement, and every muscle
quivering, he gathered himself for the mighty spring.As lightly as a
bird he cleared the fence, staggered as he struck the ground on the
other side, then on again like the wind.Fred turned in his saddle, and uttered a yell of defiance.But the hands of his troopers were unsteady,
and the shots went wild.Before his men could dismount and throw down
the fence, Fred was beyond pursuit.Captain Conway fairly foamed at the
mouth.He raved and swore like a madman."It's no use swearing, Captain," said a grizzled lieutenant."I thought
I knew something about horses, but that beat any leap I ever saw.I would rather have the horse than the boy."it's the divil's own lape," said an Irishman in the
company, and he crossed himself.The baffled troopers returned crestfallen and cross.Captain Conway was
so out of temper that even when the ladies asked him if his fall hurt
him, he answered angrily."Captain," said Alice, somewhat ruffled by his manner, "what is it
between that boy and you?He said he knew you, was in fact a dear friend
of yours, but you no sooner saw him than you shot at him; and Corporal
Smith says you called him by name, so you did know him.""Alice," replied the captain, "I do not intend to be rude, but I am all
put out.That boy is a spy, a mean, sneaking spy.It was he that discovered our plot at Lexington.""And I told him----" She stopped
suddenly.nothing, nothing; only what a good fellow you were."The captain looked at her sharply, and said: "It is well you gave away
no secrets."Fred made his way back to camp with a thankful heart.He told Colonel
Garrard of the intended attack, and then started back for the
headquarters of General Thomas.It was a long and hard ride, and it was
well in the small hours of the night when he arrived.The general was
aroused and the news of the expected attack told.He quietly wrote a
couple of orders, and went back to his bed.One order was to General
Schoepf to at once march his brigade to the relief of Colonel Garrard at
Rock Castle.The other was sent to Colonel Connell at Big Hill to move
his regiment to Rock Castle, instead of advancing toward London as
ordered.Both orders were obeyed, and both commands were in position on the 20th.General Zollicoffer made his expected attack on the 21st, and was easily
repulsed.The battle was a small one; nothing but a skirmish it would
have been called afterwards; but to the soldiers engaged at that time,
it looked like a big thing.It greatly encouraged the Federal soldiers,
and correspondingly depressed the soldiers of Zollicoffer's army.Fred got back to Rock Castle in time to see the battle.It was his first
sight of dead and wounded soldiers.And as he looked on the faces of the
dead, their sightless eyes upturned to heaven, and the groans of the
wounded sounding in his ears, he turned sick at heart, and wondered why
men created in the image of God would try to kill and maim each other.And yet, a few moments before, he himself was wild with the excitement
of battle, and could scarcely be restrained from rushing into it.The next day the army advanced, and passed the place where Fred met
with his adventure, and he thought he would make another visit to Miss
Alice Johnson.But that young lady gave him a cold reception.She called
him a "miserable, sneaking Yankee," and turned her back on him in
disgust.He didn't hear the last of his call on Miss Johnson.Fred pointed out the place where his horse had leaped the fence, and
officers and men were astonished, and Prince became as much a subject of
praise as his rider.It was a common saying among the soldiers as he
rode by, "There goes the smartest boy and best horse in Kentucky."When Fred returned to Camp Dick Robinson, he found a letter awaiting him
from General Nelson.The general was making a campaign against a portion
of the command of General Humphrey Marshall in the mountains of Eastern
Kentucky, and wrote that if Fred could possibly come to him to do so."Of course; go at once," said General Thomas, when the letter was shown
him."I am sorry to lose you, but I think Zollicoffer will be rather
quiet for a while, and General Nelson has the first claim on you.I
shall always be grateful to you for the service you have rendered me.I
trust that it is but the beginning of still closer relations in the
future."It was fated that General Thomas and Fred were to be much together
before the war closed.CHAPTER X.

IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.To his dismay, Fred noticed that the letter of General Nelson was dated
the 10th of October, and it was now the last of the month.For some
reason the letter had been greatly delayed.It was known that Nelson was already in the mountains of Eastern
Kentucky; therefore no time was to be lost if Fred joined him.Much to
his regret, Fred had to leave Prince behind.Afterwards he blessed his
stars that he did, for if he had taken the horse he would have lost him
forever.Fred traveled to Cincinnati by rail, and then by boat up the Ohio to
Maysville.He found that Nelson had not only been gone from Maysville
for some days, but that there was no direct line of communication with
his army.Nothing daunted, he determined to follow, and procuring a
horse, he started on his journey alone and unattended, and against the
advice of the officer in command at Maysville."Wait," said that officer, "until we send forward a train.It will be
strongly guarded, and you will escape all danger of capture."He believed it to be his duty to join Nelson
as soon as possible.By hard riding, he reached Hazel Green on the
evening of the second day, and without adventure.Here he learned that
Nelson's command had left the place only two days before, and was now
supposed to be at or near Prestonburg, and there were rumors of fighting
at that place.The next morning Fred pressed forward in high spirits, thinking he would
overtake at least the rear of Nelson's army by night.Along in the
afternoon four cavalrymen suddenly confronted him, blocking the road.As they all had on the blue Federal overcoat, Fred had not the remotest
idea but that they belonged to Nelson's army, and riding boldly up to
them asked how far the command was in advance.asked one of the party, who appeared to be the leader."Why, Nelson's command, of course," replied Fred, in surprise.But the
words were hardly out of his mouth before four revolvers were leveled on
him, and he was commanded to surrender.There was no alternative but to
submit as gracefully as possible."Now, boys," said the leader, "we will see what we have captured.It must be borne in mind that Fred was dressed in civilian clothes, and
therefore could not be taken prisoner as a soldier.The soldiers, after going through his pockets, handed the contents to
their leader."Ah," said that personage with a wicked grin, "young man, you may go
along with us to Colonel Williams.For aught I know, these letters may
hang you," and filing off from the Prestonburg road, they took a rough
mountain road for Piketon.Fred afterward found that the four soldiers were a scouting party that
had got in the rear of Nelson's army in the hopes of picking up some
stragglers, their only reward being himself.As was said, the party
consisted of four.The leader, Captain Bascom, was a hooked-nosed,
ferret-eyed man, who frequently took deep draughts from a canteen
containing what was familiarly known as "mountain dew"--whisky distilled
by the rough mountaineers.Being half-drunk all the time added intensity
to a naturally cruel, tyrannical disposition.One of the soldiers named Drake was a burly, red-faced fellow, who
seemed to be a boon companion of the captain; at least one took a drink
as often as the other.Another of the soldiers answered to the name of
Lyle; he was a gloomy, taciturn man, and said little.The remaining one
of Fred's captors was a mere boy, not older than himself.He was a
bright-eyed, intelligent looking fellow, tough and muscular, and from
his conversation vastly above the station in life of his comrades before
he enlisted.It was not long before Fred discovered that Captain Bascom
took delight in worrying the boy, whose name was Robert Ferror.In this
he was followed to a greater or less extent by Drake.Not only this,
but when they stopped for the night at the rude home of a mountaineer,
Fred noticed that Bob, as all called him, was the drudge of the party.He not only had to care for the captain's horse, but to perform menial
service, even to cleaning the mud from the captain's boots.As he was
doing this, Bob caught Fred looking at him, and coloring to the roots of
his hair, he trembled violently.It was evident that he felt himself
degraded by his work, but seeing a look of pity in Fred's eyes, he
fiercely whispered, "My mother's <DW65>s used to do this for me," and
then he cast such a look of hate on Captain Bascom that Fred shuddered.It was not until the evening of the second day of his capture that
Piketon was reached.Along in the afternoon, away to the left, firing
was heard, and every now and then, the deep boom of cannon reverberated
through the valleys and gorges.It made
Fred sick at heart to think that his friends were so near, and yet so
far.The knowledge that the Confederates were being driven seemed to anger
Bascom, and he drank oftener than usual.Noticing that Bob was talking
to Fred as they were riding along, he turned back and struck the boy
such a cruel blow in the face that he was knocked from his horse.By order of Bascom, Drake and Lyle dismounted, picked Bob up, wiped the
blood from his face, and after forcing some whisky down his throat,
placed him on his horse.At first he seemed dazed and could not guide
his horse.He gradually came to himself, and when he looked at Bascom
Fred saw that same murderous look come over his face which he had
noticed once before."Bascom has cause to fear that boy," thought Fred.When the party rode into Piketon they found everything in the utmost
confusion.Preparations were being made to evacuate the place.The
soldiers who had been in the fight came streaming back, bringing with
them their wounded and a few prisoners.They reported thousands and
thousands of Yankees coming.This added to the confusion and the
demoralization of the troops.The prisoners were thrown, for the night, in a building used as a jail.It was of hewn logs, without windows or doors, being entered through the
roof, access being had to the roof by an outside stairway, then by a
ladder down in the inside.When all were down, the ladder was drawn up,
and the opening in the roof closed.The place was indescribably filthy,
and Fred always wondered how he lived through the night.When morning
came and the ladder was put down for them to ascend, each and every one
thanked the Lord the rebels were to retreat, and that their stay in the
noisome hole was thus ended.With gratitude they drank in mouthfuls of
the fresh air.The whole place was in a frenzy of excitement.Commissary stores they
were not able to carry away were given to the flames.Every moment the
advance of Nelson's army was expected.But as time passed, and no army
appeared the panic somewhat subsided and something like order was
restored.That night, the retreating army camped in a pine forest at the base of a
mountain.Black clouds swept across the
sky, the wind howled mournfully through the forest, and the cold
pitiless rain chilled to the bone.Huge fires were kindled, and around
them the men gathered to dry their streaming clothes and to warm their
benumbed limbs.Just before the prisoners were made to lie down to sleep, the boy,
Robert Ferror, passed by Fred, and said in a low whisper:

"I will be on guard to-night.Was Robert Ferror going to aid him to escape?He
watched where the guard over the prisoners was stationed, and lay down
as close to him as possible.Soon he was apparently fast asleep, but he
was never wider awake.At eleven o'clock Robert Ferror came on guard.He
looked eagerly around, and Fred, to show him where he was slightly
raised his head.The boy smiled, and placed his finger on his lips.Slowly Ferror paced his beat, to and fro.Ferror's answer
was, "All is well."Another half-hour passed; still he paced to and
fro.After all, was Ferror to do nothing, or were his
words a hoax to raise false hopes?The camp had sunk to rest; the fires
were burning low.Then as Ferror passed Fred, he slightly touched him
with his foot.The next time Ferror passed
he stooped as if he had dropped something, and as he was fumbling on the
ground, whispered:

"Crawl back like a snake.About fifty yards to the rear is a large pine
tree.It is out of the range of the light of the fires.It would have taken a lynx's eye to
have noticed that one of the prisoners was missing, so silently had Fred
made his way back.One o'clock came, and Ferror was relieved.Five, ten, fifteen minutes
passed, and still Fred was waiting."I will wait a little longer," thought Fred, "and then if he does not
come, I will go by myself."Soon a light footstep was heard, and Fred whispered, "Here."A hand was stretched out, and Fred took it.It was as cold as death, and
shook like one with the palsy."He is quaking with fear," thought Fred."Have you got the revolver and cartridge belt?"asked Ferror, in a
hoarse whisper.He still seemed to be quaking as with ague.Silently Ferror led the way, Fred following.Slowly feeling their way
through the darkness, they had gone some distance when they were
suddenly commanded to halt.Ferror gave a start of surprise,
and then answered:

"A friend with the countersign.""Advance, friend, and give the countersign."Ferror boldly advanced, leaned forward as if to whisper the word in the
ear of the guard.Then there was a flash, a loud report, and with a moan
the soldier sank to the ground."Come," shrieked Ferror, and Fred, horrified, sprang forward.Through
the woods, falling over rocks, running against trees, they dashed, until
at last they had to stop from sheer exhaustion.Men
were heard crashing through the forest, escaping as they thought from an
unseen foe.But when no attack came, and no other shot was heard, the
confusion and excitement began to abate, and every one was asking, "What
is it?""The sound of the shot came from that direction," said the soldier who
had taken the place of Ferror as guard."There is where I stationed Drake," said the officer of the guard."I
discovered a path leading up the mountain, and I concluded to post a
sentinel on it.Sergeant, make a detail, and come with me."The detail was made, and they filed out in the darkness in the direction
that Drake was stationed."We must have gone far enough," said the officer."It was about here I
stationed him."It is not possible he has deserted, is
it?"He was groping around when he stumbled over something on the ground.He
reached out his hand, and touched the lifeless body of Drake.A cry of
horror burst from him.The body was taken up and carried back to camp.The officer bent over and examined it by the firelight."Shot through the heart," he muttered; "and, by heavens!Drake was shot not by some prowler, but by some one
inside the lines.The prisoners, who had all been aroused by the commotion, were huddled
together, quaking with fear.The sergeant soon reported: "Lieutenant, there is one missing; the boy
in citizen's clothes."Colonel Williams, who had been looking on with stern countenance, now
asked:

"Who was guarding the prisoners?"The colonel's tones were low and
ominous."Scott, sir," replied the sergeant of the guard."Colonel," said Scott, shaking so he could hardly talk, "before God, I
know nothing about the escape of the prisoner.I had not been on guard
more than ten or fifteen minutes before the shot was fired.Up to that
time, not a prisoner had stirred."I do not know whether he escaped before I came
on guard or after the alarm.The sergeant will bear me witness that
during the alarm I stayed at my post and kept the prisoners from
escaping.The boy might have slipped away in the confusion, but I do not
think he did."The sergeant soon returned with the information that Ferror could not be
found.He cast his eye over the group of officers
standing around him, and then suddenly asked: "Where is Captain Bascom?"The officers looked blank, then inquiringly into each other's faces.No
one had seen him during or since the alarm.The sergeant of the guard hurriedly went to a rude tent where the
captain slept.Pulling aside a blanket which served as a door he entered
the tent.A moment, and he reappeared with face as white as a sheet.his ashen lips shaped the words, but they died away in a
gurgle in his throat.Captain Bascom had been stabbed through the heart.The whole turmoil in camp was heard by Fred and Robert Ferror, as they
stood panting for breath.Fred shuddered as the horrified cry of the
officer of the day was borne to his ears when he stumbled on the dead
body of the guard.The boys were bruised and bleeding, and their
clothing was torn in shreds from their flight through the forest."It is all right now," said Ferror."They can never find us in the
darkness, but some of the frightened fools may come as far as this; so
we had better be moving."The boys slowly and painfully worked their way up the mountain, and at
last the roar of the camp was no longer heard.They came to a place
where the jutting rocks formed a sort of a cave, keeping out the rain,
and the ground and leaves were comparatively dry.The place was also
sheltered from the wind."Let us stay here," said Fred, "until it gets a little light.We can
then more easily make our way.We are entirely out of danger for
to-night."To this Ferror assented, and the two boys crept as far back as they
could and snuggled down close together.Fred noticed that Ferror still
trembled, and that his hands were still as cold as ice.The storm had ceased, but the wind sobbed and moaned through the trees
like a thing of life, sighing one moment like a person in anguish, and
then wailing like a lost soul.An owl near by added its solemn hootings
to the already dismal night.Fred felt Ferror shudder and try to creep
still closer to him.Both boys remained silent for a long time, but at
length Fred said:

"Ferror, shooting that sentinel was awful.I had almost rather have
remained a prisoner."I did not know the sentinel was there," answered Ferror, "or I could
have avoided him.As it was, it had to be done.It was a case of life or
death.Fred, do you know who the sentinel was?""It was Drake; I saw his face by the flash of my pistol, just for a
second, but it was enough.I can see it now," and he shuddered."No, Ferror; if I had been in your place, I might have done the same,
but that would have made it none the less horrible.""Fred, you will despise me; but I must tell you.""Drake is not the first man I have killed to-night."Fred sprang up and involuntarily drew away from him."After I was relieved from guard, and before I joined you, I stabbed
Captain Bascom through the heart."A low cry of horror escaped Fred's lips."Listen to my story, Fred, and then despise me as a murderer if you
will.My mother is a widow, residing in Tazewell county, Virginia.I am
an only son, but I have two lovely sisters.I was always headstrong,
liking my own way.Of course, I was humored and petted.When the war
broke out I was determined to enlist.My mother and sisters wept and
prayed, and at last I promised to wait.But about two months ago I was
down at Abingdon, and was asked to take a glass of wine.I think it was
drugged, for when I came to myself I found that I was an enlisted
soldier.Worse than all, I found that this man Bascom was an officer in
the company to which I belonged.Bascom is a low-lived, drunken brute.Mother had him arrested for theft
and sent to jail.When he got out, he left the neighborhood, but swore
he would have revenge on every one of the name.I think he was in hopes that by brutal treatment he could make me
desert, so he could have me shot if captured.When he struck me the
other day, when I spoke to you, I resolved then and there to kill him.""I know," replied Fred, in a low tone."God only knows what I have suffered from the hands of that man during
the last two months.I have had provocation enough to kill him a
thousand times.""I know, I know," replied Fred; "but to kill him in his sleep.I would
not have blamed you if you had shot him down when he gave you that blow."It would have been best," sobbed Ferror, for the first time giving way
to his feelings."Oh, mother, what will you think of your boy!"Then he
said, chokingly: "Fred, don't desert me, don't despise me; I can't bear
it.I believe if you turn from me now, I shall become one of the most
desperate of criminals.""No, Ferror," said Fred; "I will neither desert nor judge you.You have
done something I had rather lose my life than do.But for the present
our fortunes are linked together.If we are captured, both will suffer
an ignominious death.Therefore, much as I abhor your act, I cannot
divorce myself from the consequences.Then let us resolve, come what
may, we will never be taken alive."Ferror grasped Fred's hand, and pressing it fervently, replied: "If we
are captured, it will only be my dead body which will be taken, even if
I have to send a bullet through my own heart."After this the boys said little, and silently waited for the light.With the first gleam of the morning, they started on their way, thinking
only of getting as far as possible from the scene of that night of
horror.As the sun arose, the mountains and then the valleys were flooded with
its golden light.At any other time the glorious landscape spread out
before them would have filled Fred's soul with delight; but as it was,
he only eagerly scanned the road which ran through the valley, hoping to
catch sight of Nelson's advancing columns."They will surely come before long," said Fred."By ten o'clock we
should be inside of the Federal lines and safe."But if Fred had heard what was passing in the Rebel camp he would not
have been so sanguine.Lieutenant Davis, officer of the guard, and Colonel Williams were in
close consultation."Colonel," said the lieutenant, "I do not believe the Yankees are
pursuing us.Those boys will take it for granted that we will continue
our retreat, and will soon come down off the mountains into the road.Let me take a couple of companies of cavalry, and I will station men in
ambush along the road as far back as it is safe to go.In this way I
believe we stand a chance to catch them."The colonel consented, and, therefore, before the sun had lighted up the
valley, pickets had been placed along the road for several miles back.The boys trailed along the mountain side until nearly noon, but the
sides of the mountain were so seamed and gashed they made slow progress.Gaining a high point, they looked towards Piketon, and in the far
distance saw an advancing column of cavalry."There is nothing to be seen to the south," said Fred."I think we can
descend to the road in safety."So they cautiously made their way down
to the road."Let us look well to our arms," said Fred."We must be prepared for any
emergency."So their revolvers were carefully examined, fresh caps put in, and every
precaution taken.They came out on the road close to a little valley
farm.In front of the cabin stood a couple of horses hitched.After
carefully looking at the horses, Ferror said: "Fred, one of those horses
belongs to Lieutenant Davis.He has ridden back to see if he could not
catch sight of us.Nelson's men will soon send him back flying."Then a wild idea took possession of the boys.It was no less than to try
and get possession of the horses.Wouldn't it be grand to enter the
Federal lines in triumph, riding the horses of their would-be captors!Without stopping to think of the danger, they at once acted on the idea.From the cabin came sounds of laughter mingled with the music of women's
voices.Getting near the horses, the boys made a dash, were on their backs in a
twinkling, and with a yell of triumph were away.The astonished
officers rushed to the door, only to see them disappear down the road.Then they raged like madmen, cursing their fortunes, and calling down
all sorts of anathemas on the boys."Never mind," at last said Sergeant Jones, who was the lieutenant's
companion in misfortune, "the squad down the road will catch them.""Poor consolation for the disgrace of having our horses stolen," snapped
the lieutenant.The elation of the boys came to a sudden ending.In the road ahead of
them stood a squad of four horsemen.Involuntarily the boys checked the
speed of their horses.They looked into each other's faces, they read
each other's thoughts."It can only be death," said Fred."It can only be death," echoed Ferror, "and I welcome it.I know, Fred,
you look on me as a murderer.I want to show you how I can die in a fair
fight."Fred hardly realized what Ferror was saying; he was debating a plan of
attack."Ferror," he said, "let us ride leisurely forward until we get within
about fifty yards of them.No doubt they know the horses, and will be
nonplused as to who we are.It will be
all over in a moment--safety or death."He was as pale as his victims of the night before, but
his eyes blazed, his teeth were set hard, every muscle was strained.Just as Fred turned to say, "Now!"Ferror shouted, "Good-bye, Fred,"
and dashed straight for the horsemen.The movement was so sudden it left
Fred slightly behind.The revolvers of the four Confederates blazed, but
like a thunderbolt Ferror was on them.The first man and horse went down
like a tenpin before the ball of the bowler; the second, and boy and man
and both horses went down in an indistinguishable mass together.As for Fred, not for a second did he lose command of himself or his
horse.He saw what was coming, and swerved to the right.Here a single
Confederate confronted him.This man's attention had been attracted for
a moment to the fate of his comrades in the road, and before he knew it
Fred was on him.He raised his smoking revolver to fire, but Fred's
revolver spoke first, and the soldier reeled and fell from his saddle.The road was now open for Fred to escape, but he wheeled his horse and
rode back to see what had become of his comrade.One Confederate still
sat on his horse unhurt.Seeing Fred, he raised his pistol and fired.Fred felt his left arm grow numb, and then a sensation like that of hot
water running down the limb.Before the soldier could fire the second
time, a ball from Fred's pistol crashed through his brain, and he fell,
an inert mass, in the road.Of the two Confederates overthrown in the wild charge of Ferror, one was
dead, the other was untouched by bullets, but lay groaning with a
broken leg and arm.He lay partly
under his horse, his eyes closed, his bosom stained with blood.[Illustration: Fred raised his Head, "Ferror!"It's all right, Fred--all right,"
he gasped."That was no murder--that was a fair fight, wasn't it?""It is better as it is, Fred.He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was with a far-away
look."Yes, mother," he whispered, and then
his eyes closed forever.The clatter of horses' hoofs, and the clang of sabers were now heard.Fred looked up; a party of Federal cavalry was bearing down upon him.They looked on the bloody scene in astonishment.A dashing young captain
rode up.Fred pointed to young Ferror's lifeless body, and said: "Bring
his body back to Piketon with you.I am one of
General Nelson's scouts."Then everything grew black before him, and he knew no more.He had
fainted from the loss of blood.The rough troopers bound up his arm, staunched the flow of blood, and
soon Fred was able to ride to Piketon.General Nelson received him with
astonishment; yet he would not let him talk, but at once ordered him to
the hospital.As for Robert Ferror, he was given a soldier's burial.A year after the war closed, Frederic Shackelford, a stalwart young man,
sought out the home of Mrs.He found a gray-haired,
brokenhearted mother and two lovely young ladies, her daughters.They
had mourned the son and brother, not only as dead, but as forever
disgraced, for they had been told that Robert had been shot for
desertion.Fred gave them the little mementoes he had kept through the years for
them.He told them how Robert had given his life to try and save him,
and that the last word that trembled on his lips was "Mother."The gray-haired mother lifted her trembling hands, and thanked God that
her son had at least died the death of a soldier.Learning that the family had been impoverished by the war, when Fred
left, he slipped $1,000 in Mrs.Ferror's hand, and whispered, "For
Robert's sake;" and the stricken mother, through tear-dimmed eyes,
watched his retreating form, and murmured: "And Robert would have been
just such a man if he had lived."CRAZY BILL SHERMAN.The ball had gone through the
fleshy part of the arm, causing a great loss of blood; but no bones were
broken, and it was only a question of a few weeks before he would be as
well as ever.The story of the two boys charging four Confederate cavalrymen, killing
three, and disabling the fourth was the wonder of the army.But Fred
modestly disclaimed any particular bravery in the affair."It is to poor Bob Ferror that the honor should be given," he would say;
"the boy that knowingly rode to his death that I might be saved."Fred gave General Nelson the particulars of his capture and escape, and
the general looked grave and said:

"If I had known I was going to place you in such extreme danger, I
should not have sent for you.On account of the crime of young Ferror,
you would have met with a most ignominious death if you had been
recaptured; yet the charging on those four cavalrymen was one of the
pluckiest things I have heard of during the war.You deserve and shall
have a good rest.I have just finished making up some dispatches for
General Sherman, and you shall be my messenger.A dispatch boat leaves
in the morning, and you shall go with it.When you get to Catlettsburg,
you can take an Ohio river steamer for Louisville.The trip being all by
water, will be an easy one, and as a number of sick and wounded will be
sent away on the same boat, you will have good surgical attendance for
your wounded arm.Here is a paper that will admit you to the officers'
hospital when you get to Louisville.I do
not think it will be long before I, with my command, will be ordered
back to Louisville.The enemy has retreated through Pound Gap into
Virginia, and there is nothing more for me to do here.Stay in
Louisville until you hear from me."The next morning found Fred on his way down the Big Sandy.The whole
voyage was uneventful, and after a quick trip Fred once more found
himself in Louisville.The rest and quiet of the voyage had almost cured
the ill-effects of his experience, and with the exception of his wounded
arm, which he was compelled to carry in a sling, he was feeling about as
well as ever.Once in Louisville, he lost no time in turning over his dispatches to
General Sherman.He found the general surrounded by a delegation of the
prominent Union men of the city.They seemed to be arguing with Sherman
about something, and as for the general, he was in a towering rage, and
was swearing in a manner equal to General Nelson in one of his outbreaks
of anger.Fred was surprised to find the usually mild and gentlemanly officer in
such a passion, but there was no mistake, he was angry clear through."There is no use talking, gentlemen," he was saying, as he paced the
room with quick nervous tread, "I am not only going to resign, but I
have already sent in my resignation.I will not remain in command of the
Department of Kentucky another day; the command of the armies of the
United States would not induce me to remain and be insulted and outraged
as I have been.""We are very sorry to hear it, General," replied the spokesman of the
delegation."We had great hopes of what you would accomplish when you
were appointed to the command of the department, and our confidence in
you is still unabated.""I am thankful," replied the general, "for that confidence, but what can
you expect of a man bound hand and foot.They seem to know a great deal
better in Washington what we need here than we do who are on the ground.This, in a measure, is to be expected; but to be reviled and insulted is
more than I can stand.But if I had not resigned, I should be removed, I
know that.Just let the newspapers begin howling at a general, and
denouncing him, and every official at Washington begins shaking in his
boots.What can be expected of a general with every newspaper in the
land yelping at his heels like a pack of curs?If I wanted to end this
war quickly, I would begin by hanging every editor who would publish a
word on how the war should be conducted."Are you not a little too severe on the newspaper fraternity, General?"mildly put in one of the citizen delegates.They think
they know more about war, and how to conduct campaigns than all the
military men of the country combined.Not satisfied with telling me how
and when to conduct a campaign, they attack me most unjustly and
cruelly, attack me in such a manner I cannot reply.Just listen to
this," and the general turned and took up a scrapbook in which numerous
newspaper clippings had been pasted."Here is an editorial from that
esteemed and influential paper, _The Cincinnati Commerce_," and the
general read:

"'It is a lamentable fact that many of our generals are grossly
incompetent, but when incipient insanity is added to incompetency, it is
time to cry a halt.Right here at home, the general who commands the
Department of Kentucky and therefore has the safety of our city in his
hands, is W. T. Sherman.We have it on the most reliable evidence that
he is of unsound mind.Not only do many of his sayings excite the pity
of his friends and ridicule of his enemies, but they are positively
dangerous to the success of our cause.The Government should at least
put the department in charge of a general of sound mind.'"Now, if that is not enough," continued the general, with a touch of
irony in his tones, "I will give you a choice clipping from the great
_New York Tricate_."'It is with sorrow that we learn that General W. T. Sherman, who is in
command of the Department of Kentucky, is not in his right mind.It is
said that the authorities at Washington have been aware of this for some
time, but for political reasons fear to remove him.He is a brother of
John Sherman, one of the influential politicians of Ohio, and United
States Senator-elect.While the affair is to be regretted, the
Government should not hesitate on account of political influence.That he is mentally unsound
is admitted, even by his best friends.The whole company was smiling at the absurdity of the affair."I will read once more," said the general."It is from the _Chicago
Timer_, and hits others as well as myself.Here it is:

"'General Bill Sherman, in command of the Department of Kentucky, is
said to be insane.In our mind the whole Lincoln
Government, from President down, is insane--insane over the idea that
they can coerce the South back into the Union.The only difference that
we can see is that Bill Sherman may be a little crazier than the rest;
that's all.'"There," continued the general, "are only a few of the scores of
extracts which I have from the most influential papers in the land.Of
course the smaller papers have taken their cue from the larger ones, and
now the whole pack of little whiffets are after me, snapping at my
heels; and the good people believe the story because it is published.Hundreds of letters are being received at Washington, asking for my
removal.My brother writes that he is overwhelmed with inquiries
concerning me.I believe the War Department more than half believes I am
of unsound mind.They are only waiting for an excuse to get rid of me,
and I know that my resignation will be received with joy.""General," asked one of the citizens present, "have you any idea of how
the story of your insanity started?""When Secretary of War Cameron was here,
I laid before him the wants of Kentucky, and among other things said
that I needed 60,000 men for defensive work, but for offensive
operations I should need 200,000.The Secretary spoke of it as an
'insane request.'Some reporter got hold of it, and then it went.The
Secretary has never taken the pains to correct the impressions.""Were you not a little extravagant in your demands?"The politicians at Washington have never yet recognized
the magnitude of the war in which we are engaged.Then their whole life
is office, and they are afraid of doing something that will lose them a
vote.As for the newspapers, they would rather print a sensation than
have us win a victory.They have called me crazy so much they
have alarmed my wife," and the general again indulged in another burst
of anger.When he became calmer, he said: "Gentlemen, I thank you for
your expressions of sympathy and confidence.I trust my successor will
be more worthy than I," and he bowed the delegation out.The general noticed him, and asked: "Well, my
boy, what is it?Why, bless my soul, it's Fred Shackelford!"Yes, General, with dispatches," and he handed them to him."I will read them when I cool off a little; I have been rather warm.I
see your arm is in a sling; been in a skirmish?"The wound didn't amount to much; it is
nearly well.""You should be thankful it is no worse.Come in in the morning, Fred; I
will have the dispatches read by that time."Fred called, as requested, the next morning, and found the general calm
and courteous as ever."General Nelson writes good news," said Sherman."He reports he has
entirely driven the Rebels out of the valley of the Big Sandy.He also
tells me in a private letter of your capture and escape.He speaks of
the desperate conflict that you and your comrade had with four Rebel
cavalrymen.My boy, I shall keep my
eye on you.I surely should ask for your services myself if I were going
to remain in command of the department.""General, I am sorry to have you resign," answered Fred, hardly knowing
what to say.The general's face darkened, and then he answered lightly: "I do not
think they will be sorry at Washington."And they were not; his resignation was gladly accepted, and the general
who afterward led his victorious army to Atlanta, and then made his
famous march to the sea, and whose fame filled the world, retired under
a cloud.And the injustice of it rankled in his breast and imbittered
his heart for months.The general appointed to succeed Sherman was Don Carlos Buell, a
thorough soldier, and, like McClellan, a splendid organizer; but, like
that general, he was unsuccessful in the field, and during what is known
as the "Bragg-Buell campaign" in Kentucky in the fall of 1862, he
entirely lost the confidence of his soldiers.Buell's first attention was given to the organization of his army and
the drilling of his soldiers.His labors in this direction were very
successful, and the "Army of the Cumberland" became famous for its
_esprit de corps_.General Nelson, according to his predictions, was ordered back with his
command to Louisville.Fred, now entirely well, was greatly rejoiced to
once more see his old commander.But there was little prospect of active
service, for the division was ordered into camp for the purpose of
drilling and being perfected in military duties.Idleness was irksome to
Fred, so he asked and obtained permission to join General Thomas, and
remain until such time as Nelson might need his services.General Thomas gave Fred a most cordial reception.There was something
about the handsome, dashing boy that greatly endeared him to the staid,
quiet general.Just now, Fred's presence was very desirable, for
Zollicoffer was proving very troublesome, threatening first one point
and then another, and it was almost impossible to tell which place was
in the most danger.General Thomas' forces were greatly scattered,
guarding different points, and he feared that at some of these places
his troops might be attacked and overpowered.He had asked permission of
Buell time and again to be allowed to concentrate his forces and strike
Zollicoffer a telling blow, but each and every time had met with a
refusal.Instead of being allowed to concentrate his force, he was
ordered to move portions of his command here and there, and the orders
of one day might be countermanded the next.Being December, the roads
were in a horrible condition, and it was almost impossible to move
trains, so that his army was being reduced by hard service which did no
good.He would sit for
hours buried in thought or poring over maps.All this time, Zollicoffer was ravaging the middle southern counties of
Kentucky, threatening first London, then Somerset, then Columbia, then
some intermediate point.The outposts of the army were often attacked,
and frequent skirmishes took place.In the midst of this activity, Fred
found congenial employment.He was kept busy carrying dispatches from
one post to another, or on scouting expeditions, trying to gain
information of the movements of the enemy.He frequently met squads of
the enemy, and had many narrow escapes from capture; but the fleetness
of his horse always saved him.Of all General Thomas' scouts, Fred obtained the most valuable
information.While not venturing into the enemy's lines, he had a way of
getting information out of the inhabitants friendly to the South that
surprised even the general.Fred hardly ever made a mistake as to the
movements of the opposing army.If there was one thing that he loved more than another it was his horse.He had trained him to do anything that a horse could do.At a word he
would lie down and remain as motionless as if dead.He would go anywhere
he was told without hesitating, and his keen ear would detect the
presence of an enemy quicker than the ear of his master.Fred had also
perfected himself in the use of a revolver until he was one of the best
shots in the army.He could ride by a tree at full gallop, and put three
balls in a three-inch circle without checking his speed."My life," he would say, "may depend on my being able to shoot quickly
and accurately."On some of his scouts Fred would take a party with him, and there was
not a soldier who did not consider it one of the greatest honors to be
thus chosen.One day near the close of the year Fred was scouting with a picked
force of five men a few miles to the east and south of Somerset.As they
were riding through a piece of wood, Prince suddenly stopped, pricked up
his ears, listened a moment, and then turned and looked at his master,
as if to say, "Danger ahead!""To cover, boys," said Fred, in a low tone.The party turned aside into the wood, and was soon completely hidden
from view."Steady now," said Fred; "no noise.""Are you sure your horse is as wise as you think?""Perfectly sure; Prince never makes a mistake.The trampling of horses, and the jingling of sabers could plainly be
heard, and soon a party of nine Confederate cavalrymen came riding by.They had no thought of danger, and were laughing and talking, thinking
not that death lurked so near them."The old traitor lives right ahead," they heard one say."We will learn him to harbor East Tennessee bridge-burners," said the
leader with a coarse laugh."Will it be hanging or shooting, Sergeant?"It's such fun to see a Lincolnite hanging by the neck
and dancing on air.Never shoot a man if you can hang him, is my motto."Fred's men heard this conversation with lowering brows, and the
muttered curses were deep if not loud, and five carbines were raised,
but with a gesture Fred motioned them down.His men looked at him in
astonishment, and there was disappointment on every face.As soon as the Confederates were out of hearing, so it was safe to
speak, one of the men said with a sigh:

"Capt'in,"--the soldiers always called Fred captain when they were out
with him--"I would hev give five dollars for a shot.I would hev fetched
that feller that loved to see hangin', sure.""I have strict orders," replied Fred, "to avoid fighting when I am out
on these scouting expeditions.It is the part of a good scout never to
get into a fight except to avoid capture.A scout is sent out to get
information, not to fight; a conflict defeats the very object he has in
view.""That's so, capt'in, but it goes agin the grain to let them fellers
off.""I may have made a mistake," replied Fred, "in letting those fellows
off.Come to think about it, I do not like what they said."Worse than that, capt'in.""We will follow them up," said Fred, "as far as we can unobserved.You
remember we passed a pretty farmhouse some half a mile back; that may be
the place they were talking about.We can ride within three hundred
yards of it under cover of the forest."Riding carefully through the wood, they soon came in sight of the
place.Surely enough, the Confederates had stopped in front of the
house.Four of them were holding the horses, while the other five were
not to be seen.As they sat looking the muffled sound of two shots were
heard, and then the shrieking of women."Boys," said Fred, in a strained voice, "I made a mistake in not letting
you shoot.There are
nine of them; we are six.shouted every one, their eyes blazing with excitement."Then for God's sake, forward, or we will be too late!"for the frenzied
shrieks of women could still be heard.They no sooner broke cover, than the men holding the horses discovered
them, and gave the alarm.The five miscreants who were in the house came
rushing out, and all hastily mounting their horses, rode swiftly away.The Federals, with yells of vengeance, followed in swift pursuit; yet in
all probability the Confederates would have escaped if it had not been
for the fleetness of Prince.Fred soon distanced all of his companions,
and so was comparatively alone and close on the heels of the enemy.They noticed this, and conceived the idea that they could kill or
capture him.Fred was watching for this very
thing, and as they stopped he fired, just as the leader's horse was
broadside to him.Then at the word, Prince turned as quick as a flash,
and was running back.The movement was so unexpected to the Confederates
that the volley they fired went wild.As for the horse of the Confederate leader, it reared and plunged, and
then fell heavily, pinning its rider to the ground.Two of his men
dismounted to help him.When he got to his feet, he saw that Fred's
companions had joined him and that they all were coming on a charge.Now, boys, stand firm; there are only six of them.But it takes men of iron nerve to stand still and receive a charge, and
the Federals were coming like a whirlwind.The Confederates emptied their revolvers at close range, and then half
of them turned to flee.It was too late; the Federals were among them,
shooting, sabering, riding them down.When it was over, eight Confederates lay dead or desperately wounded.Of
the six Federals, two were dead and two were wounded.Only one
Confederate had escaped to carry back the story of the disaster.[Illustration: The Federals were among them, shooting, sabering, riding
them down.]One of the wounded Confederates lay groaning and crying with pain, and
Fred going up to him, asked if he could do anything for him.The man looked up, and then a scowl of hate came over his face.he groaned, and then with an oath said: "I will have
you if I die for it," and attempted to raise his revolver, which he
still clutched.As quick as a flash Fred knocked it out of his hand, and as quick one of
Fred's men had a revolver at the breast of the desperate Confederate.Fred knocked the weapon up, and the shot passed harmlessly over the head
of the wounded man."None of that, Williams," said Fred."We cannot afford to kill wounded
men in cold blood.""But the wretch would have murdered you, capt'in," said Williams, and
then a cry went up from all the men.Fred looked at the man closely, and then said: "You are Bill Pearson,
the man I struck with my riding-whip at Gallatin.""You miserable wretch," said Fred, contemptuously."By good rights I
ought to blow your brains out, but your carcass is not worth the powder.Just then Fred noticed a countryman who had been attracted by the sound
of the firing, and motioned to him to approach.He came up trembling,
and looked with wonder on the dead men and horses."My good man," said Fred, "here are some wounded men that should be
looked after.Can you not do it, or get word to their command?""I reckon I kin," slowly replied the countryman."Yes," replied Fred; "and this reminds me, boys, we had better get away
from here.We do not know how many of the enemy may be near."The wounds of the two Federals who had been hurt were bound up, and they
were helped on their horses.The bodies of the two dead were then
tenderly placed on two of the Confederate horses which were unhurt, and
the mournful cavalcade slowly moved away.Going back to the house which the Confederates had entered, a
distressing sight met their view.On a bed, the master of the house lay dead, shot to death by the
murderers.By the bedside stood the wife and two daughters, weeping and
wringing their hands.The face of the widow was covered with blood, and
there was a deep gash on her head where one of the wretches had struck
her with the butt of his revolver, as she clung to him imploring him not
to murder her husband.The pitiful sight drove Fred's men wild, and he had all that he could do
to prevent them from going back and finishing the wounded murderers."You did wrong, capt'in, in not letting me finish that red-handed
villain who tried to shoot you," said Williams.With broken sobs the woman told her story.Her husband had a brother in
East Tennessee, who had been accused by the Confederate authorities of
helping burn railroad bridges.He escaped with a number of Union men,
and was now a captain in one of the Tennessee regiments."They came here," said the woman, "and found my husband sick in bed, so
sick he could not raise a finger to help himself.They accused him of
harboring his brother, and of furnishing information, and said that they
had come to hang him, but as he was sick they would shoot him.And
then," sobbed the woman, "notwithstanding our prayers, they shot him
before our eyes.and the stricken wife broke
completely down, and the daughters hung over the body of their murdered
father, weeping as if their hearts would break.He told the sobbing women that he would at once
report the case, and have her husband's brother come out with his
company."We will also," said Fred, "leave the bodies of our two dead
comrades here.If you wish, I will send a chaplain, that all may have
Christian burial.And, my poor woman, your wrongs have been fearfully
avenged.Of the nine men in the party that murdered your husband, but
one escaped.said the women, raising their streaming eyes to
heaven.Even the presence of death did not take away their desire for
revenge.Such is poor human nature, even in gentle woman."War makes demons of us all," thought Fred.The story of that fight was long a theme around the camp fire, and the
three soldiers who survived never tired of telling it.As for Fred, he
spoke of it with reluctance, and could not think of it without a
shudder.Fifteen men never engaged in a bloodier conflict, even on the
"dark and bloody ground" of Kentucky.THE MEETING OF THE COUSINS.General Thomas sat in his headquarters at Lebanon looking over some
dispatches which Fred had just brought from General Schoepf at Somerset.His face wore a look of anxiety as he read, for the dispatches told him
that General Zollicoffer had crossed to the north side of the Cumberland
river and was fortifying his camp at Beech Grove."I may be attacked at any moment," wrote General Schoepf, "and you know
how small my force is.For the love of heaven, send me reinforcements."The general sat with his head bowed in his hands thinking of what could
be done, when an orderly entered with dispatches from Louisville.Thomas
opened them languidly, for he expected nothing but the old story of
keeping still and doing nothing.Suddenly his face lighted up; his whole
countenance beamed with satisfaction, and turning to Fred he said:

"My boy, here is news for us, indeed.General Buell has at last
consented to advance.He has given orders for me to concentrate my army
and attack Zollicoffer at the earliest possible moment.""General," he exclaimed, "I already see Zollicoffer defeated, and hurled
back across the Cumberland.""Don't be too sanguine, Fred," he said; "none of
us know what the fortune of war may be; we can only hope for the best.But this means more work for you, my boy.You will at once have to
return with dispatches to General Schoepf.Somerset must be held at all hazards.""I am ready to start this minute with such tidings," gayly responded
Fred."Prince, poor fellow, will have it the hardest, for the roads are
awful.""That is what I am afraid of," replied the general."I hope to be with
Schoepf within a week, but, owing to the condition of the roads, it may
take me much longer."Within an hour Fred was on his way back to Somerset.It was a terrible
journey over almost impassable roads; streams, icy cold, had to be
forded; but boy and horse were equal to the occasion, and in three days
reached Somerset.He
commenced his march from Lebanon on December 31st; it was January 18th
before he reached his destination.The
rain poured in torrents, and small streams were turned into raging
rivers.Bridges were swept away, and had to be rebuilt.The soldiers,
benumbed with chilling rain, toiled on over the sodden roads, cheerful
in the thought that they were soon to meet the enemies of their country.General Schoepf received the news of General Thomas' advance with great
satisfaction."If I can only hold on," he said, "until Thomas comes, everything will
be all right.""We must show a bold front, General," replied Fred, "and make the enemy
believe we have a large force.""It's the enemy that is showing a bold front nowadays," replied General
Schoepf, with a faint smile."They have been particularly saucy lately.They have in the last few days, cut off two or three small scouting
parties.But what worries me the most is that there is hardly a night
but that every man on some one of our picket posts is missing.There is
no firing, not the least alarm of any kind, but the men in the morning
are gone.It is a mystery we have tried to solve in vain.At first we
thought the men had deserted, but we have given that idea up.The men
are getting superstitious over the disappearance of so many of their
comrades, and are actually becoming demoralized.""General, will you turn this picket business over to me?""I have heard much of your ability in
ferreting out secret matters.Your success as a scout I am well
acquainted with, as you know.I hope you will serve me as well in this
matter of the pickets, for I am at my wits' end.""Well, General, to-morrow I will be at your service, and I trust you
will lose no more pickets before that time," and so saying Fred took his
leave, for he needed rest badly.The next morning, when Fred went to pay his respects to the general, he
found him with a very long face."Another post of four men disappeared
last night," he said."Well, General, if possible, I will try and
solve the problem, but it may be too hard for me.""Have you any idea yet how they are captured?"I must first look over the ground carefully, see how the
men are posted, talk with them, and then I may be able to form an idea."Fred's first business was to ride out to where the post had been
captured during the night.This he did, noting the lay of the ground,
carefully looking for footprints not only in front, but in the rear of
where the men had been stationed.He then visited all the picket posts,
talked with the men, learned their habits on picket, whether they were
as watchful as they should be--in fact, not the slightest thing of
importance escaped his notice.On his return from his tour of inspection, Fred said to General
Schoepf, "Well, General, I have my idea.""Your pickets have been captured from the rear, not the front.""I mean that some of the pickets are so placed that a wary foe could
creep in between the posts and come up in the rear, completely
surprising the men.I think I found evidence that the men captured last
night were taken in that way.I found, at least, six posts of which I
believe an enemy could get in the rear without detection, especially if
the land had been spied out.""You astonish me," said the general."But even if this is so, why does
not the sentinel give the alarm?""He may be in such a position that he dare not," answered Fred."That a double force be put on the posts, half to watch the rear.It
will be my business to-night to see to that.""Very well," replied General Schoepf."I shall be very curious to see
how the plan works, and whether your idea is the correct one or not.""I will not warrant it, General," replied Fred, "but there will be no
harm in trying."Just before night Fred made a second round of the picket posts, and
made careful inquiry whether any one of the posts had been visited
during the day by any one from the outside.All of the posts answered in the negative save one.The corporal of that
post said: "Why, a country boy was here to sell us some vegetables and
eggs.""Was he a bright boy, and did he seem to notice
things closely?""On the contrary," said the corporal, "he appeared to be remarkably dull
and ignorant.""Has the same boy been in the habit of selling vegetables to the
pickets?"Come to think about it, the corporal believed he had heard such a boy
spoken of.Then one of the men spoke up and said:

"You know Rankin was on the post that was taken in last night.He had a
letter come yesterday, and I took it out to him, and he told me of what
a fine supper they were going to have, saying they had bought some eggs
and a chicken of a boy."suddenly exclaimed the corporal, "that boy to-day walked to
the rear some little distance--made an excuse for going; he might not
have been such a fool as he looked.""Corporal, I will be here a little after dark
with a squad of men to help you keep watch.In the mean time keep a
sharp lookout.""That I will," answered the corporal."Do you think that boy was a
spy?"But if any
trouble occurs on the picket line to-night, it will be at this post."That night Fred doubled the pickets on six posts which he considered the
most exposed.But the extra men were to guard the rear instead of the
front.The most explicit instructions were given, and they were
cautioned that they were to let no alarm at the front make them relax
their vigilance in the rear.Thirty yards in the rear of the post where
he was to watch Fred had noticed a small ravine which led down into a
wood.It was through this ravine that he concluded the enemy would creep
if they should try to gain the rear of the post.Fred posted his men so
as to watch this ravine.To the corporal who had charge of the post, he
said:

"My theory is, that some one comes up to your sentinel, and attracts his
attention by pretending to be a friend, or perhaps a deserter.This, of
course, will necessitate the sentinel's calling for you, and naturally
attract the attention of every man awake.While this is going on, a
party that has gained the rear unobserved will rush on you and be in
your midst before you know it, and you will be taken without a single
gun being fired."said one, "I believe it could be done.""Now," continued Fred, "if you are hailed from the front to-night act
just as if you had not heard of this.When everything was prepared the soldiers, wrapped in their blankets,
sat down to wait for what might come.So intently did they listen that
the falling of a leaf would startle them.There was a half-moon, but dark clouds swept across the sky, and only
now and then she looked forth, hiding her face again in a moment.Once
in a while a dash of cold rain would cause the sentinels to shiver and
sink their chins deeper into the collars of their great coats.Midnight came, and still all was quiet.The soldiers not on guard lay
wrapped in their blankets, some of them in the land of dreams.Off in the woods the hoot of an owl was heard.A few minutes passed, and again the dismal "Whoo!Instantly they were all
attention, and every sense alert.whispered the sergeant, next to him."Nothing but the suspicious hooting of an owl," whispered back Fred.Then to the soldiers, "Perfectly still, men; not a sound."So still were they that the beatings of their hearts could be heard.Again the dismal hoot was heard, this time so near that it startled
them.Then from the sentinel out in front came the short, sharp challenge,
"Who comes there?""A deserter who wishes to come into the
lines and give himself up."The corporal went forward to receive the deserter.Now there came the
sound of swiftly advancing footsteps in front of the rear post, and dim
figures were seen through the darkness.Seven rifles belched forth their contents, and for a moment the flashes
of the guns lighted up the scene, and then all was dark.There were cries of pain, hoarse yells of surprise and anger, and then a
scattering volley returned."Use your revolvers," shouted Fred, and a rapid fire was opened.There were a few more
scattering shots, and all was still.The deserter, who was so anxious to give himself up, the moment the
alarm was given fired at the sentinel and vanished in the darkness.The sound of the firing created the wildest commotion in camp.The long
roll was beaten; the half-dressed, frightened soldiers came rolling out
of their tents, some without their guns, others without their cartridge
boxes; excited officers in their night clothes ran through the camp,
waving their bare swords and shouting: "Fall in, men, for God's sake,
fall in."It was some minutes before the excitement abated, and every one was
asking, "What is it?The officer of the day, with a strong escort, came riding out to where
the firing was heard.Being challenged, he gave the countersign, and
then hurriedly asked what occasioned the firing."Oh," cheerfully responded Fred, "they tried to take us in, and got
taken in themselves."An examination of the ground in front of where Fred's squad was
stationed revealed two Confederates still in death, and trails of blood
showed that others had been wounded."You can go to your quarters," said Fred to his men."You will not be
needed again to-night; and, Lieutenant," said he, turning to the officer
of the day, "each and every one of these men deserves thanks for his
steadiness and bravery.""I hardly think, General," said Fred, the next morning, as he made his
report, "that your pickets will be disturbed any more."As for General Schoepf, he was delighted, and could not thank Fred
enough.For three or four days things were comparatively quiet.Then a small
scouting party was attacked and two men captured.The next day a larger
party was attacked and driven in, with a loss of one killed and three
wounded.The stories were the same; the leader of the Confederates was a
young lieutenant, who showed the utmost bravery and handled his men with
consummate skill."I wish," said General Schoepf to Fred, "that you would teach this
young lieutenant the same kind of a lesson that you taught those fellows
who were capturing our pickets.""I can try, General, but I am afraid the job will not only be harder,
but much more dangerous than that one," answered Fred."This same young lieutenant," continued the general, "may have had a
hand in that picket business, and since he received his lesson there has
turned his attention to scouting parties.""In that case," replied Fred, "it will take the second lesson to teach
him good manners.Well, General, I will give it to him, if I can."The next morning, with eight picked men from Wolford's cavalry, Fred
started out in search of adventure."Don't be alarmed, General," said Fred, as he rode away, "if we do not
come back to-night.Many of their comrades, with longing eyes, looked after them, and wished
they were of the number; yet they did not know but that every one was
riding to death or captivity.Yet such is the love of adventure in the
human breast that the most dangerous undertakings will be gladly risked.After riding west about three miles Fred turned south and went about the
same distance.He then halted, and after a careful survey of the country
ahead, said: "I think, boys, it will be as well for us to leave the road
and take to the woods; we must be getting dangerously near the enemy's
country."The party turned from the road and entered a wood.Working their way
through this, skirting around fields, and dashing across open places,
after making a careful observation of the front, they managed to proceed
about two miles further, when they came near the crossing of two main
roads.Here they stopped and fed their horses, while the men ate their
scanty fare of hard bread and bacon.They had not been there long before a squadron of at least 200
Confederate cavalry came from the south, and turning west were soon out
of sight."I hardly think, boys," said Fred, "it would have paid us to try to take
those fellows into camp; we will let them go this time," and there was a
twinkle in his eye, although he kept his face straight."Just as you say, capt'in," replied one of the troopers, as he took a
chew of tobacco."We would have gobbled them in if you had said the
word."A little while after this a troop of ten horsemen came up the same road,
but instead of turning west they kept on north.At the head of the troop
rode a youthful officer.One of the soldiers with Fred was one of the number that had been
attacked and defeated two days before by the squad of which they were in
search."That's he, that's the fellow!"What he had come for, fate had thrown
in his way."If they were double, we would fight them," cried the men all together."Let them pass out of sight before we pursue," said Fred."The farther
we get them from their lines the better.""Now," said Fred, after they had waited about five minutes.A ride of a
few minutes more brought them into the road.Halting a moment, Fred
turned to his men and said:

"Men, I know every one of you will do your duty.All I have to say is
obey orders, keep cool, and make every shot count.With a cheer they followed their gallant young leader.After riding
about two miles, Fred reined up and said: "They have not dodged us, have
they, boys?We ought to have sighted them before this.Here is where we
turned off of the road.I believe they noticed that a squad
of horsemen had turned off into the woods, and are following the tracks.Let's see," and Fred jumped from his horse, and examined the tracks
leading into the woods."That's what they did, boys," said he, looking up."I will give that
lieutenant credit for having sharp eyes.Now, boys, we will give him a
surprise by following."They did not go more than half a mile before they caught sight of the
Confederates.Evidently they had concluded not to follow the tracks any
farther, for they had turned and were coming back, and the two parties
must have sighted each other at nearly the same moment.There was the sharp crack of a carbine, and a ball whistled over the
Federals' heads.The young lieutenant who led the Confederates was
far too careful a leader to charge an unknown number of men.Instead of
charging the Confederates dismounted, and leaving their horses in charge
of two of their number the rest deployed and advanced, dodging from tree
to tree, and the bullets began to whistle uncomfortably close, one horse
being hit."Dismount, and take the horses back," was Fred's order."We must meet
them with their own game."The two men who were detailed to take the
horses back went away grumbling because they were not allowed to stay in
the fight.Telling them to keep well covered, Fred advanced his men slightly, and
soon the carbines were cracking at a lively rate.But the fight was more noisy than dangerous, every man being careful to
keep a tree between himself and his foe."This can be kept up all day," muttered Fred, "and only trees and
ammunition will suffer.Orders were given to fall back to the horses, and the men obeyed
sullenly.A word from Fred, and their faces brightened.Mounting their
horses, they rode back as if in disorderly retreat.As soon as the Confederates discovered the movement, they rushed back
for their horses, mounted, and with wild hurrahs started in swift
pursuit of what they thought was a demoralized and retreating foe.Coming to favorable ground, Fred ordered his men to wheel and charge.So
sudden was the movement that the Confederates faltered, then halted.cried their young leader, spurring his horse on, but at that
moment a chance shot cut one of his bridle reins.The horse became
unmanageable, and running under the overhanging branches of a tree, the
gallant lieutenant was hurled to the ground.His men, dismayed by his
fall, and unable to withstand the impetuous onslaught of the Federals,
beat a precipitate retreat, leaving their commander and two of their
number prisoners in the hands of their foes.Two more of their men were
grievously wounded.Three of the Federals had been wounded in the mêlée.Fred dismounted and bent over the young lieutenant, and then started
back uttering an exclamation of surprise and grief.He had looked into
the face of his cousin, Calhoun Pennington.Hurriedly Fred placed his
hand on the fallen boy's heart.There was no sign of a
wound on his body.He has only been stunned by the fall," exclaimed Fred.In the mean time the five remaining Confederates had halted about a
quarter of a mile away, and were listening to what a sergeant, now in
command, was saying."Boys," he exclaimed, "it will be to our everlasting shame and disgrace
if we run away and leave the lieutenant in the hands of those cursed
Yankees.Some of them must be disabled, as well as some of us.Let us
charge and retake the lieutenant, or die to a man in the attempt.""Here is our hand on that, Sergeant," said each one of the four, and one
after the other placed his hand in that of the grim old sergeant.But just as they were about to start on their desperate attempt, they
were surprised to see Fred riding towards them, waving a white
handkerchief.When he came in hailing distance, he cried:

"Men, your gallant young leader lies over here grievously hurt.We are
going to withdraw," and wheeling his horse, he rode swiftly back.One of his men was so badly
wounded that he had to be supported on his horse; therefore their
progress was slow, and it was night before they reached camp.Fred made
his report to General Schoepf and turned over his two prisoners.The
general was well pleased, and extended to Fred and the soldiers with him
his warmest congratulations."If you had only brought in that daring young lieutenant with you your
victory would have been complete," said the general."I hardly think, General," said Fred, "that you will be troubled with
him any more.He was still insensible when we left, and with my three
wounded men and the two prisoners it was well-nigh an impossibility for
us to bring him in.""I know," replied the General, "and as you say, I think we have had the
last of him.""I sincerely hope so," was Fred's answer as he turned away, and it meant
more than the general thought.Fred had a horror of meeting his cousin
in conflict, and devoutly prayed he might never do so again.Every time he closed his eyes he could see the pale
face of his cousin lying there in the wood, and the thought that he
might be dangerously hurt, perhaps dead, filled him with terror."Why,"
he asked himself over and over again, "did the fortune of war bring us
together?"Let us return to the scene of the conflict, and see how Calhoun is
getting along.The Confederates received Fred's message with surprise."That lets us out of a mighty tough scrape," remarked the sergeant."We
must have hurt them worse than we thought.""Don't know about that," answered one of his men who was watching the
Federals as they retired."There is only one of them who appears to be
badly hurt; and they have poor Moon and Hunt in limbo, sure.""Better be prisoners than dead," answered the sergeant."But, boys, let
us to the lieutenant.It's strange the Yanks didn't try to take him
back."When they reached Calhoun, he was already showing signs of returning
consciousness, and in a few minutes he was able to sit up and converse."Then we whipped them after all," and his face lighted up with joy."Can't say that we did, Lieutenant," answered the sergeant; "but they
left mighty sudden for some reason."Calhoun looked around on his men with a troubled countenance."I see
only five of you," he said; "where are the rest?""Two are back nursing wounds," answered the sergeant."Sheldon is hit,
so hard hit I am afraid he is done for.As for Moon and Hunt, they have
gone off with the Yanks."The tears rolled down the cheeks of the young officer."Boys," he said,
chokingly, "I believe I have lost my grip.There was that last picket
affair that went against us, and now we are all broken up in a fair
combat.""Don't take on, Lieutenant," said the sergeant, soothingly."It was that
chance bullet that cut your bridle rein that did the business.If it
hadn't been for that we would have wiped them out, sure.As it is, we
are thankful they didn't take a notion to lug you off.""No, they didn't," replied the sergeant, and then he told Calhoun what
had happened."What kind of a looking man was the leader of the Yanks?""He was a boy, no older than yourself.He was mounted on a magnificent
bay horse with a star in the forehead."I see it all," sighed Calhoun."The leader of that party was my cousin,
Fred Shackelford.Boys, help me on my
horse.I am badly shaken up, but not seriously hurt.We will square
accounts with those fellows one of these days."And the little party, bearing their wounded, sadly wended their way back
to the Confederate camp.For the next few days the weather was so bad and the roads in such a
terrible condition that both armies were comparatively quiet.Nothing as
yet had been heard from the advance of General Thomas, and General
Schoepf began to be very uneasy.At last Fred offered to ride toward
Columbia, and see if he could not get some tidings of the missing
column.The offer was gladly accepted, and Fred set out.He met with no
adventure until about fifteen miles from Somerset, when he suddenly came
face to face with a young soldier, and he supposed a Federal, as he wore
a blue great coat.But a second look caused a cry of surprise to burst
from Fred's lips, and at the same time the supposed Federal soldier
snatched a revolver from the holster.The cousins were once more face to
face."Put up your revolver, Calhoun," cried Fred."Is that the way you greet
your cousin?"For a moment Calhoun gazed on Fred in silence, then raising his hand in
courtly salute, he suddenly turned his horse, and jumping him over a low
fence, disappeared in a copse of wood.Fred was on the point of raising his voice to call him back, when it
flashed upon him that Calhoun had been playing the spy, and that he dare
not stop, even for a moment."He was only stunned after all, when he was hurled from his horse,"
thought Fred."I am so glad; a heavy load has been lifted from my mind.It would have been extremely awkward for
me to have found out he was a spy, and then let him go."It was with a lighter heart that he pursued his journey, but he had gone
but a short distance when he met a courier from General Thomas with
dispatches for General Schoepf.He was informed that the advance of
General Thomas was but a short distance in the rear.A few moments more
and Fred was in the presence of his general.said Thomas, "I am glad to see you."All right, General, only General Schoepf has been sorely worried over
your non-appearance."The march has been an awful one, and has taken three
times as long as I expected.But we will be at Logan's Cross Roads
to-night, where I shall halt to concentrate my army.If the enemy does
not retreat, we may look for a lively time in about three days.""The lively time, General, may come before three days," answered Fred,
significantly."The Rebels may conclude," answered Fred, "to attack you before you can
bring up the rest of your force, or get aid from Somerset.Fishing Creek
is very high; I had to swim it.It will be almost impossible to get
infantry or artillery over.""I have thought of that," replied the general, smiling."I shall try and
be ready for them if they come."Fred was right in his surmise that Calhoun had been acting the part of a
spy.He had been playing a very dangerous game, and had been successful.Disguised as a country boy, he had boldly entered Columbia, and in a
great measure had fathomed the plans of General Thomas.It was a matter
of common report that as soon as the army could be concentrated, General
Zollicoffer would be attacked.Calhoun had made a careful estimate of
the strength of Thomas' army, and when met by Fred he was taking an
observation of his order of march, and how long it would take the rear
brigade to reinforce the advance brigade, if it should be attacked.The sudden meeting with Fred was a surprise to him.But when he heard
Fred's voice he knew his life was in no danger; yet he dare not tarry,
even for a moment, and so escaped as we have seen.No sooner was he out of sight of Fred than he checked his horse."That
was a lucky escape," he said to himself."If I had to meet any one, it
was fortunate I met Fred.I would so much like to have a talk with him, but it would have been
madness to have stopped, and then it would have placed him in a very
awkward predicament.Selim, old boy," continued he, patting his horse's
neck, "we have work yet before us; we must see where General Thomas
camps."It was early on the morning of January 18th that Calhoun rode into the
Confederate camp at Beech Grove.Without changing his mud-bespattered
garments, he at once sought the quarters of Major-General G. B.
Crittenden, who had been placed in chief command of the army."Ah, Lieutenant," exclaimed the general, "I am glad to see you.I have
been thinking of you, and blaming myself for permitting you to go on
your hazardous adventure.He who acts as a spy takes his life in his
hands.""It is an old saying that 'all is well that ends well,'" Calhoun
answered, smiling."You ought to have seen what a splendid country
bumpkin I made; and I have succeeded beyond my most sanguine
expectations.I have very important news for you, General.General
Thomas is now encamped at Logan's Cross Roads, only ten miles away.He
will wait there for his rear brigade, and also for reinforcements from
Somerset.He has only one brigade with him, numbering not much over
4,000 men."Calhoun then went on and gave General Crittenden the full details of the
strength of the Federal army, saying that he thought the rear brigade
of Thomas' army could not reach Logan's Cross Roads for at least two
days, and that owing to the height of water in Fishing Creek he believed
it impossible for Thomas to receive reinforcements from Somerset."If these forces all combine, General," continued Calhoun, "they will so
far outnumber us that it would be madness to risk a battle.To-morrow
Thomas will be isolated; his force is inferior to yours."You think that your information as to numbers and position is
absolutely correct, do you?""I do, General," answered Calhoun."If you attack General Thomas in the
morning I am confident you will attack with a superior force.""It is either that or a disastrous retreat," said the general, gravely."I will call a council of my officers at once."As soon as I can get off some of this mud I will be ready," answered
Calhoun.The council was called, and General Crittenden laid the facts before his
officers.Calhoun was asked a great many questions, to all of which he
gave full and sufficient answers.The council, without a dissenting
voice, voted to attack Thomas the next morning.It was nearly midnight when the Confederates marched out of their
entrenchments, General Zollicoffer's brigade having the advance.Calhoun acted as aid on the staff of General Crittenden.The distance,
ten miles, made a fearful night march, considering the roads.Calhoun
afterwards said that it was one of the worst marches he ever made.A cold drizzling rain fell that chilled the
soldiers to the very bone.Through the rain and the mud for hour after
hour the brave men of the Confederacy toiled on, animated by the hope
that they would soon meet and hurl back in inglorious defeat the men
whom they considered ruthless invaders of their soil.It took nearly
seven hours to march that ten miles, every step being taken through mud
and water, sometimes nearly knee deep.Just as the gray shadows in the east betokened the ushering in of the
short January day, the crack!of guns in front told that the
Federal pickets had been alarmed.The sharp reports of those guns as
they echoed back along the mud-stained ranks caused the weary soldier to
forget his weariness.The cold was no longer felt, the excitement of the
coming battle sent the blood tingling through the veins.It is time to turn now to General Thomas and his little army that lay
encamped at Logan's Cross Roads in the darkness and shadows of that
gloomy night.Couriers had been sent back to hurry up the rear brigade;
orders had been sent to General Schoepf to at once forward three
regiments, but General Thomas well knew if he was attacked in the
morning none of these reinforcements would reach him.The general sat in his tent, listening to Fred giving an account of what
had happened at Somerset during the three weeks he had been there.He
was especially interested in the account Fred gave of his picket fight."That, Shackelford," said the general, "was strategy worthy of a much
older head.Your little fight was also admirably managed.""I had rather it had been against any one than my cousin," answered
Fred."Such things cannot be avoided," answered Thomas, with a sigh.I am a Virginian, and must fight against those who are
near and dear to me."Fred did not answer; he was thinking of his father.The general sat as if buried in deep thought for a moment, and then
suddenly looking up, said:

"Shackelford, you know when we were going into camp this evening that
you said you feared an attack in the morning.""I am almost positive of it, General," was Fred's reply."Because the enemy is well posted and must know that you mean to attack
them when your forces are consolidated, and your army will be so strong
they cannot hope to stand before it.I am also of the opinion that they
are well informed of your isolated position here; that one of your
brigades is two days' march in the rear, also that owing to the high
stage of water in Fishing Creek it will be impossible for General
Schoepf to reinforce you for a day or two.I also believe that the enemy
has a fair estimate of your exact strength."During this speech of Fred's the general listened intently, and then
said: "You have a better idea of my actual position than I trust most of
my officers have, but you said some things which need explaining.On
what grounds do you base your belief that the enemy are so well
acquainted with my situation and strength?""No positive proof, General, but an intuition which I cannot explain.But this impression is also based on more solid ground than intuition.Yesterday, just before I met your advance, I met a man in our uniform.When he saw me he jumped his horse over a fence and disappeared in a
wood.To-day I caught a glimpse of
that same man in the woods yonder on our right."Thomas mused a moment, and then said: "If the Confederate general fully
knows our situation and strength, he is foolish if he does not attack
me.But if he does, I shall try and be ready for him."The general then once more carefully examined his maps of the country,
gave orders that a very strong picket should be posted, and that well in
advance of the infantry pickets cavalry videttes should be placed, and
that the utmost vigilance should be exercised.Then turning to Fred, he said: "If your expectations are realized in the
morning, you may act as one of my aids.And now, gentlemen," said he,
turning to his staff, "for some sleep; we must be astir early in the
morning."In the gray light of the early morning, from away out in front, there
came the faint report of rifles.Early as it was, General Thomas and staff had had their breakfast, and
every soldier was prepared.General Manson, in command of the advance regiments, came galloping back
to headquarters."General," he said, "we are attacked in force.""Go back," replied General Thomas, without betraying any more excitement
than if he were ordering his men out on review, "form your men in the
most advantageous position, and hold the enemy until I can bring up the
rest of the troops."In a trice aids were galloping in every direction.The fitful reports of guns in front had become a steady roll of
musketry.The loud mouth of the cannon joined in, and the heavy
reverberations rolled over field and through forest.In an incredibly
short time every regiment was in motion towards where the heavy smoke of
battle was already hanging over the field.Of all the thousands, the general commanding seemed the most
unconcerned.He leisurely mounted his horse and trotted toward the
conflict.His eye swept the field, and as the regiments came up they
were placed just where they were needed.His manner inspired every one
who saw him with confidence.To Fred the scene was inexpressibly grand.The
wild cheering of men, the steady roll of musketry, the deep bass of
cannon, thrilled him with an excitement never felt before.The singing
of the balls made strange music in his ears.Now and then a shell or
solid shot would crash through the forest and shatter the trees as with
a thunderbolt.Soon a thin line of men came staggering back, some
holding up an arm streaming with blood, others hobbling along using
their guns as crutches.A few, wild with fear, had thrown away their
guns, and were rushing back, lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but an insane desire to get out of that hell of fire.At first there was a lump in the throat, as if
the heart was trying to get away, a slight trembling of the limbs, a
momentary desire to get out of danger, and then he was as cool and
collected as if on parade.Through the storm of balls he rode,
delivering his orders with a smiling face, and a word of cheer.General
Thomas noticed the coolness of his aid, and congratulated him on his
soldierly qualities.On the left, in front of the Fourth Kentucky Regiment, the battle was
being waged with obstinate fury.Colonel Fry, seeing Fred, rode up to
him, and said: "Tell General Thomas I must have reinforcements at once;
the enemy is flanking me.""Say to Colonel Fry," said Thomas, "that I will at once forward the aid
required.Until the reinforcements come, tell him to hold his position
at all hazards."Fry compressed his lips, glanced along his
line, saw the point of greatest danger, and quickly ordered two of his
left companies to the right, leading them in person, Fred going with
him.An officer enveloped in a large gray coat suddenly rode out of the wood,
and galloping up to them shouted: "For God's sake, stop firing!You are
firing on your own men."Just then two other officers rode up to the one in a gray cloak.Seeing
Colonel Fry and Fred, they at once fired on them.Colonel Fry was
slightly wounded, but Fred was untouched.As quick as thought both
returned the fire.The officer at whom Fred fired reeled in his saddle,
then straightened up and galloped to the rear.Colonel Fry fired at the
officer in the gray cloak.He threw up his arms, and then plunged
headlong to the ground.The bullet from Colonel Fry's pistol had pierced the heart of General
Zollicoffer.The battle now raged along the entire line with great fury.The lowering
clouds grew darker, and the pitiless rain, cold and icy, fell on the
upturned faces of the dead.The cruel storm beat upon the wounded, and
they shivered and moaned as their life's blood ebbed away.The smoke
settled down over the field and hid the combatants from view, but
through the gloom the flashes of the guns shone like fitful tongues of
flame.Then the Federal line began to press forward, and soon the whole
Confederate army was in full retreat.[Illustration: The Battle now raged along the entire line with great
fury.]It was at this time that Fred's attention was attracted to a young
Confederate officer, who was trying to rally his men.Bravely did he
strive to stay the panic, but suddenly Fred saw him falter, sway to and
fro, and then fall.Once more did the Confederates try to rally under
the leadership of a young mounted officer, but they were swept aside,
and the battle was over.Fred's first thought was for the young Confederate officer whom he saw
fall while trying to rally his men.There was something about him that
seemed familiar.Fred's heart stood still at the
thought.He was lying on his
side, his head resting on his left arm, his right hand still grasping
his sword, a smile on his face.As Fred looked on the placid face of the
dead, a groan burst from him, and the tears gushed from his eyes.With
his handkerchief he wiped away the grime of battle, and there, in all
his manly beauty, Bailie Peyton lay before him.Fred's thoughts flew
back to that day at Gallatin.No more would those eloquent lips hold
entranced a spellbound audience.No more would his fiery words stir the
hearts of his countrymen, even as the wind stirs the leaves of the
forest.Tenderly did Fred have him carried back and laid by the side of his
fallen chieftain.As soon as
possible the remains of both were forwarded through the lines to
Nashville.It was not the city that Fred saw in August.Then it was wild and
hilarious with joy, carried away with the pomp and glory of war.Zollicoffer was the idol of the people of Tennessee; Bailie Peyton of
its young men.That both should fall in the same battle plunged
Nashville in deepest mourning.When the bodies arrived, it was a city of tears.Flags floated at
half-mast; women walked the streets wringing their hands and weeping
bitter tears.She was to drink
still deeper of the bitter cup of war.Back over the ten miles that they had marched through the darkness and
rain, the Confederate army fled in the wildest confusion.Swift in
pursuit came the victorious army of Thomas.Before night his cannon were
shelling the entrenchments at Beech Grove.There was no rest for the
hungry, weary, despondent Confederates.In the darkness of the night
they stole across the river, and then fled, a demoralized mob, leaving
everything but themselves in the hands of the victors.The next morning an officer came to Fred and said one of the prisoners
would like to see him."One of the prisoners would like to see me," asked Fred, in surprise."I don't know," answered the officer."But he is a plucky chap; it's the
young lieutenant who headed the last rally of the Rebs.He fought until
he was entirely deserted by his men and surrounded by us; he then tried
to cut his way out, but his horse was shot and he captured.""It must be Calhoun," and he rushed to
where the prisoners were confined.And the boys were in each other's arms."Cal, you don't know how glad I am to see you," exclaimed Fred.answered Calhoun, with a dash of his old spirits."No," said Fred; "like St.Paul, I will say 'except these bonds.'But
Calhoun, I must have a good long talk with you in private.""Not much privacy here, Fred," said Calhoun, looking around at the crowd
that was staring at them.Fred went to General Thomas and told him that his cousin was among the
prisoners, and asked permission to take him to his quarters.The
permission was readily given, and the boys had the day and night to
themselves.How they did talk, and how much they had to tell each other!First Fred
had to tell Calhoun all about himself.When he had finished Calhoun grasped his hand and exclaimed: "Fred, I am
proud of you, if you are fighting with the Yanks.How I would like to
ride by your side!But of all your adventures, the one with poor Robert
Ferror touches me deepest.He must
have had a great deal of pure gold about him, notwithstanding his
cowardly crime.""He did," sighed Fred, "he did; and yet I can never think of the
assassination of Captain Bascom without a shudder.On the other hand, I
can never think of Ferror's death without tears.As I think of him now,
I am of the opinion that the indignities heaped upon him had, in a
measure, unbalanced his mind, and that the killing of Bascom was the act
of an insane person.But, Cal, I hate to talk about it; that night of
horrors always gives me the shivers."There is not much to tell," answered Calhoun."You know I left Danville
with your father for Bowling Green.Owing to the influence of my father,
I was commissioned a second lieutenant and given a place on the staff of
Governor Johnson.You know a provisional State government was organized
at Bowling Green, and G. M. Johnson appointed Governor.When General
Buckner tried to capture Louisville by surprise, and you objected by
throwing the train off the track, I was one of the victims of the
outrage.I recognized you, just as your father ordered the volley
fired."did he order that volley fired at
me?""Yes; but he did not know it was you when he gave the order.When I
called out it was you, he nearly fainted, and would have fallen if one
of his officers had not caught him.He wanted to resign then and there,
but General Buckner would not hear of it.Really, Fred, I think he would
have ordered that volley even if he had known you; but if you had been
killed, he would have killed himself afterward.""He loves me even if he has disowned me.""Well," continued Calhoun, "to make a long story short, I became
prodigiously jealous of you.You were covering yourself with glory while
I was sitting around doing nothing.As Zollicoffer appeared to be the only one of the Confederate generals
who was at all active, I asked and received permission to join him,
where I was given a roving commission as a scout.If I do say it, I made
it rather lively for you fellows.At length I hit upon a nice little
plan of capturing your pickets, and was quite successful until you found
it out and put an end to my fun.""Calhoun," exclaimed Fred, in surprise, "was it you with whom I had that
night fight?""It was, and you came near making an end of your hopeful cousin, I can
tell you.Out of seven men, I had two killed and four wounded.Only one
man and myself escaped unhurt, and I had three bullet holes through my
clothes.That put an end to my raids upon your pickets, and I confined
myself to scouting once more.Then came that unlucky fight with you in
the woods.Fred, I must congratulate you on the way you managed that.Your retreat showed me your exact strength, and I thought I could wipe
you off the face of the earth.Your sudden wheel and charge took us
completely by surprise, and disconcerted my men.That shot which cut my
bridle rein took me out of the fight, and perhaps it was just as well
for me that it did.When I came to and found out what had been done, I
at once knew you must have been in command of the squad, and if I could
I would have hugged you for your generosity.""Cal," replied Fred, his voice trembling with emotion, "you can hardly
realize my feelings when I saw you lying pale and senseless there before
me; it took all the fight out of me.""I know, I know," answered Calhoun, laying his hand caressingly on
Fred's shoulder."I was badly shaken up by that fall, but not seriously
hurt.Now, comes the most dangerous of my adventures.When I met you in
the road, I----"

"Stop!"broke in Fred, "not another word.Of course you were on one of
your scouting expeditions."A curious look came over Calhoun's face, and then he said, in a low
voice: "You are right, Fred; I was on one of my scouting expeditions,"
and he shuddered slightly."Fred," suddenly asked Calhoun, "is there any possible way for me to
keep from going to prison?""Sometimes prisoners give their parole," answered Fred."I will see what
can be done."The next morning General Thomas sent for Fred, and said that he was
about to send some dispatches to General Buell at Louisville."And,"
continued he, "owing to your splendid conduct and the value of the
services you have rendered, I have selected you as the messenger.Then,
in all probability, it will be very quiet in my front for some time,
and General Nelson may have more active work for you.You know," he
concluded with a smile, "I only have the loan of you."Fred heartily thanked the general for the honor bestowed, and then said:
"General, I have a great boon to ask.""You know my cousin is here a prisoner.He is more like a brother than a
cousin--the only brother I ever knew.The boon I ask is that you grant
him a parole."Calhoun was sent for, and soon stood in the presence of the general."An officer, I see," said the general, as he glanced Calhoun over."Yes, sir; Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Governor Johnson's staff,"
answered Calhoun, with dignity."What were you doing up here if you are one of Johnson's staff?""Lieutenant, your cousin has asked as a special favor that you be
granted a parole.He says that you reside in Danville, and as he is
going to Louisville, he would like to have you accompany him as far as
your home.""General," answered Calhoun, "you would place me under a thousand
obligations if you would grant me a parole; but only on one condition,
and that is that you effect my exchange as quickly as possible.""I see," said he, "that you and Shackelford are
alike; never satisfied unless you are in the thickest of the fray.The parole was made out, and Fred and Calhoun made preparations to start
for Danville.Never did two boys enjoy a ride more than they did.In spite of bad roads and bad weather, the exuberance of their spirits
knew no bounds.They were playmates again, without a word of difference
between them.As far as they were concerned, the clouds of war had
lifted, and they basked in the sunlight of peace."I say, Fred," remarked Calhoun, "this is something like it; seems like
old times.Why did this war have to come and separate us?""The war, Calhoun," he answered, "has laid a heavier hand
on me than on you, for it has made me an outcast from home.""Don't worry, Fred; it will come out all right," answered Calhoun,
cheerily.On the morning of the second day the boys met with an adventure for
which they were not looking.Even as early in the war as this, those
roving bands of guerrillas which afterward proved such a curse to the
border States began to appear.It was somewhat of a surprise to the boys
when four men suddenly rode out of the woods by the side of the road,
and roughly demanded that they give an account of themselves."By my authority," answered the leader, with a fearful oath."And your authority I refuse to acknowledge," was the hot answer."See here, young man, you had better keep a civil tongue in your head,"
and as the leader said this he significantly tapped the butt of his
revolver."I wish to know who you are, and where you are going, and that ----
quick.""That is easily answered," replied Calhoun."As you see by my uniform, I
am a Confederate officer.I am on parole, and am on my way to my home in
Danville, there to wait until I am regularly exchanged.""And I suppose your companion is also
in the Confederate service.""Not at all," replied Fred, quietly."I am in the service of the United
States.""I think both of you are
Lincolnites.We will have to search you, and I think in the end shoot
you both.""Here is my parole," said Calhoun, his face growing red with anger.The man took it, glanced it over, and then coolly tore it in two, and
flung it down."Any one can carry such a paper as that.We
want them horses, and we want you.Boys, it will be fun to try our
marksmanship on these youngsters, won't it?"and he turned to his
companions with a brutal laugh.But the guerrillas made a great mistake; they thought they were only
dealing with two boys, and were consequently careless and off their
guard.With a sharp, quick look at Calhoun which meant volumes, Fred quickly
drew his revolver.There was a flash, a report, and the leader of the
guerrillas dropped from his horse.With a startled oath, the others drew
their revolvers, but before they could raise them there were two reports
so close together as almost to sound as one, and two more of the gang
rolled from their horses.The remaining one threw up his hands and began
to beg for mercy.[Illustration: Fred drew his Revolver, and the Guerrilla dropped from
his horse.]"You miscreant you," exclaimed Calhoun, covering him with his revolver."I ought to send a ball through your cowardly carcass, to be even with
my cousin here; for he got two of you, while I only got one.""You have; then so much the worse for the wife and children.""I am not fit to die," he blubbered."That is plain to be seen," answered Calhoun."Now hand me your weapons--butts first, remember.""Now pick up that parole your leader tore and threw down, and hand it to
me."Calhoun sat eyeing him a moment, and then continued: "I ought to shoot
you without mercy, but I believe in giving a dog a chance for his life,
and so I will give you a chance.You mount your horse, and when I say
'Go,' you go.After I say 'Go' I shall count five, and then shoot.If I
miss you, which I don't think I shall, I shall continue shooting as long
as you are in range; so the faster you go, the better for you.The man looked appealingly at Calhoun, but seeing no mercy, mounted his
horse as quick as his trembling limbs would let him.His face was white
with fear, and his teeth fairly rattled they chattered so.Calhoun reined his horse around so he was by the fellow's side.The man gave a yell of terror, bent low over his horse's neck and was
off like a shot.Calhoun with a chuckle fired over him, and the fellow
seemed to fairly flatten out.Four times did Calhoun fire, and at each
report the flying horseman appeared to go the faster.As for Fred, he was convulsed with merriment, notwithstanding the
grewsome surroundings."Leave these carrion where they are," said Calhoun in response to a
question from Fred as to what disposition they should make of the dead."That live companion of theirs will be back when we are gone."They rode along in silence for a while, and then Calhoun suddenly said:
"Fred, how I wish I could always fight by your side.It's a pity we have
to fight on different sides.""Just what I was thinking of, Cal," answered Fred; "but we have the
satisfaction of knowing we have fought one battle together.""And won it, too," shouted Calhoun.They reached Danville in due time and without further adventure.To say
that Judge Pennington was surprised to see them riding up together would
be to express it mildly; he was astounded.Then he had his arms around
his boy, and was sobbing, "My son!"And Fred, too," said the judge, at last turning from welcoming his son."I am truly glad to see you, my boy.But how in the world did you two
happen to come together?"And so the whole story had to be told, and the judge listened and
wondered and mourned over the defeat of the Confederates at Mill
Springs."My boy," said the judge, with tears glistening in his eyes, "at least I
am glad to know that you did your duty.""If all the Confederates had
been like Calhoun, we might not have won the victory.""Unless all the Federals had been like you," responded Calhoun
gallantly.The judge would have both boys tell him the full particulars of their
adventures, and listened to their recital with all the pleasure of a
schoolboy.But when they were through, he shook his head sadly, and
said: "Boys, you can't keep that pace up.But I
am proud of you, proud of you both, if Fred is fighting for that
horrible Lincoln."It was a happy day Fred spent at his uncle's.If bitterness was felt towards him it was not shown.When it was noised about that both Calhoun and Fred had returned, they
were besieged with callers.The story of the battle of Mill Springs had
to be told again and again.Colonel Fry was one of the influential
citizens of the city, and especially were they eager to hear the
particulars of his killing General Zollicoffer.Fred concluded to ride his horse to Louisville, instead of riding to
Nicholasville or Lebanon and taking the cars from one of those places."I must have Prince wherever I go after this," he said.asked General Nelson, as Fred rode up to
his headquarters after a very prosaic journey of three days."It is no one else, General," laughed Fred, as he dismounted."Here I
am, here is my good horse, Prince, and here is a letter to you from
General Thomas."Nelson took the letter, read it, and looking up smiling, said: "I see
you still keep up your habit of doing something unusual.Thomas speaks
in the highest terms of your work.the first real victory we have
gained."Yes, General; I have voluminous dispatches for General Buell.I was so
eager to see you I stopped before delivering them.""Ah, my boy, I believe you do think something of bluff old Nelson after
all, even if he has a devil of a temper," and the general kindly patted
the boy on the head."You know, General," he said, brokenly,
"that you took me in, when my father cast me out.""For the good of the country, my boy, for the good of the country," said
the general brusquely."But, come, Fred, I will ride over to General
Buell's headquarters with you.I would like to see General Thomas' full
report of the battle."They found General Buell in the highest of spirits, and Fred was given a
warm welcome.He looked over General Thomas' report, and his whole face
beamed with satisfaction.He asked Fred a multitude of questions, and
was surprised at the knowledge of military affairs which he showed in
his answers."I think, General," said General Buell, turning to Nelson, after he had
dismissed Fred, "that you have not overestimated the abilities of your
protégé.In a private note General Thomas speaks in the highest terms of
him."Somehow I have taken wonderfully to
the boy."What it was General Buell was to do for Fred, that individual was in
ignorance.While in Louisville many of Fred's leisure moments were spent at the
hospitable home of the Vaughns.Mabel's betrothed was now at the front,
and it was astonishing how much note paper that young lady used in
writing to him."You don't write that often to your brother," said Fred, smiling.asked Mabel, looking up in surprise."Yes, your humble servant; didn't you adopt me as a brother?"she replied, "one doesn't have to write
so often to a brother.Lovers are like babies; they have to be petted.But to change the subject, where does my knight-errant expect to go for
his next adventure?""Things appear to be rather quiet just
now."But events were even then transpiring that were to take Fred to a
different theater of action.Commodore Foote and General U. S. Grant sat conversing in the
headquarters of the latter at Cairo, Illinois.The general was puffing a
cigar, and answered in monosyllables between puffs."You have heard nothing yet, have you, General," the commodore was
asking, "of that request we united in sending to General Halleck?"There was silence for some time, the general apparently in deep thought.The commodore broke the silence by asking:

"You went to see him personally once on this matter, did you not?""He ungraciously gave me permission to visit St.Louis in order to see
him, after I had begged for the privilege at least half a dozen times,"
Grant answered."And you laid the matter before him in all its bearings?"asked the commodore, starting in surprise."I mean," said he, "that he struck me metaphorically.I
don't believe he would have hurt me as badly, if he had really struck
me.I was never so cut in all my life.I came away feeling that I had
committed an unpardonable sin from a military standpoint.""Then he would not hear to the proposition at all?"I came away resolving never to ask
another favor of him.Yet so anxious am I to make this campaign that, as
you know, I swallowed my pride and united with you in making the request
that we be allowed to make the movement.""It is strange," replied the commodore, "that he should ignore both our
requests, not favoring us even with a reply.Yet it seems that he must
see that Fort Henry should be reduced at once.If we delay, both the
Cumberland and the Tennessee will be so strongly fortified that it will
be almost impossible to force a passage.Everything is to be gained by
moving at once."Even a civilian ought to see that," replied Grant, as he slowly blew a
cloud of smoke from his mouth, and watched it as it lazily curled
upward."The truth of it is," Grant continued slowly, as if weighing every word,
"too many of us are afraid that another general may win more honor than
we.Now, here are
Buell and myself; each with a separate command, yet both working for the
same object.I should either be subject to the command of Buell, or he
should be subject to my orders.We are now like two men trying to lift
the same burden, and instead of lifting together, one will lift and then
the other.Such a system can but prolong the war indefinitely.""General," said the commodore, earnestly, "I sincerely wish you had the
supreme command here in the West.I believe we would see different
results, and that very soon."Grant blushed like a schoolgirl, fidgeted in his seat, and then said:
"Commodore, you do me altogether too much honor.But this I will say, if
I had supreme command I should not sit still and see the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers fortified without raising a hand to prevent it.Neither do I believe in letting month after month go by for the purpose
of drilling and organizing.The Government seems to forget that time
gives the enemy the same privilege.What is wanted is hard blows, and
these blows should be delivered as soon as possible.Sherman was right
when he asked for 200,000 men to march to the Gulf, yet he was sneered
at by the War Department, hounded by every paper in the land, called
insane, and now he is occupying a subordinate position.The war could be
ended in a year.No one now can tell how long it will last."Just then a telegram was placed in Grant's hands.He read it, and his
whole face lighted up with pleasure."You look pleased," said the commodore."The telegram must bring good
news."Without a word Grant placed the telegram in the hands of the commodore.It was an order from General Halleck to move up the Tennessee as soon as
possible and capture Fort Henry."At last," said the commodore, his face showing as much pleasure as did
Grant's."At last," responded Grant; and then, quickly, "Commodore, we may have
done an injustice to General Halleck.There may be good reasons we know
not of why this order should not have been made before.Commodore, be
ready to move with your fleet to-morrow.""General, I shall be ready; and now good-bye, for both of us have much
before us.But before I go, let me congratulate you.I believe that
success and great honor await you," and with these words the commodore
withdrew.The next day, with 15,000 men, General Grant was steaming up the
Tennessee.General Buell sat in his headquarters at Louisville.General Nelson,
accompanied by Fred, had dropped in to see his general, and at the same
time to give vent to some of his pent-up feelings.he fumed, "for us to sit here and let the
Rebels fortify Bowling Green and Dover and Columbus, and build forts to
blockade the Tennessee, and we not raise a finger to prevent it."Buell smiled at his irate general, and asked: "And what would you do,
Nelson?"I would give
them precious little time to build forts."Before General Buell could answer, an orderly entered with a telegram.He read it, and turning to Nelson, said:

"Well, General, you can cease your fuming.This telegram is from General
Halleck.He tells me he has ordered General Grant up the Tennessee to
reduce Fort Henry, and he wants me to co-operate as much as possible in
the movement."Nelson was on his feet in an instant."General," he exclaimed, "I have a favor, a great favor to ask of you."Buell smilingly answered: "I think I know what it is without your
asking."I do not see how I can spare so many men; you know we have Johnston at
Bowling Green to look after.""But General," answered Nelson, "the Tennessee and Cumberland must be
defended.In all probability the most of Johnston's army will be
transferred there.""In that case, General," answered Buell, "I will remember you.Your
division shall be the first one sent.""Thank you, General, thank you," replied Nelson."I only wish I knew I
was going.""As it is now," continued Buell, "I shall order General Crittenden to
send Cruft's brigade.That brigade is near the mouth of Green river.There is no force of the enemy, in any number, before them, and the
brigade can well be spared.I shall send no more men unless it is
absolutely necessary.I shall at once dispatch an officer to General
Crittenden with necessary orders.""General," now spoke up Fred, "like General Nelson, I have a request to
make, and by your kindness I hope to meet with better success."said Buell, "you wish to carry the orders.If Nelson has no
objection, I think I can grant that request.The general has told me
something of your history, Mr.General Thomas also speaks
in the highest terms of you.""You can go if you wish, Fred," answered Nelson."I only hope I shall
soon be with you."So it was settled, and before night Fred and his good horse Prince were
on their way down the Ohio.Fred not only carried dispatches to General
Crittenden, but he had personal letters both from General Buell and
General Nelson to General Cruft commending him to the latter officer.Disembarking at Owensboro, Fred made a swift ride to Calhoun, the
headquarters of General Crittenden.He delivered his dispatches to the
general, and at once sought the headquarters of General Cruft.The
general read Fred's letters, and then said: "You are very welcome, Mr.Shackelford; you may consider yourself as one of my staff until such
time as General Nelson may join us."Soon orders came to General Cruft to at once prepare to join Grant.It was nearly noon on February the 14th when the fleet on which General
Cruft's brigade had embarked arrived at Fort Donelson.The place had
already been invested two days, and some severe fighting had taken
place.The weather, from being warm and rainy, had suddenly turned cold
on the afternoon of the 13th, and Fred shivered as he emerged from the
comfortable cabin of the steamboat and stepped out on the cold, desolate
bank of the river.The ground was covered with ice and snow, and the
scene was dreary in the extreme.Now and then the heavy reverberation of a cannon came rolling down the
river, and echoed and re-echoed among the hills.A fleet of gunboats lay
anchored in the river, the mouths of their great guns looking out over
the dark sullen water as though watching for their prey.General Cruft's
brigade was assigned to the division of General Lew Wallace, which
occupied the center of the Federal army.Back in the rear little groups
of soldiers stood shivering around small fires, trying to warm their
benumbed limbs, or to cook their scanty rations.The condition of the soldiers was pitiable in the extreme.There were
no tents; but few had overcoats, and many on the hard, muddy march from
Fort Henry had even thrown away their blankets.In the front lines no
fires could be lighted, and there the soldiers stood, exposed to the
furious storm of sleet and snow, hungry, benumbed, hardly knowing
whether they were dead or alive.Such were the heroes who stood for
three days before Donelson.As Fred looked on all this suffering, he wondered at the fortitude with
which it was endured.There were few complaints from the soldiers; they
were even cheerful and eager to meet the foe.About three o'clock the gunboats came steaming up the river and engaged
the Confederate batteries.It was a most sublime spectacle, and held Fred spellbound.The very
heavens seemed splitting, and the earth shook and trembled from the
heavy concussions.Nearer and nearer the gunboats came to the batteries
until it seemed to Fred the great guns were vomiting fire and smoke into
each other's throats.During the fight Fred noticed a small, thickset man sitting on his horse
intently watching the fight.His countenance was perfectly impassive,
and one could not tell by watching him whether he sympathized with
friend or foe.The boilers of the Essex had been
blown up, the other boats were bruised and battered and torn by the
great shots which had struck them, and were helplessly drifting down
the stream.From the Federal side there
went up a great groan of disappointment, while from the Confederate
lines there arose the wild cheers of victory.The silent man on horseback turned and rode away.Not a sign, not a word
that he was disappointed.asked Fred of an officer standing by him."That, young man," was the answer, "is General Grant.He must be awfully
cut up, but he does not show it."Fred turned and looked after Grant as he rode slowly away."There,"
thought Fred, "is a man who is going to make his mark in this war.In
some of his actions he reminds me of General Thomas.On the frozen ground, without tents or fire,
the soldiers once more made their beds.The wind sighed and moaned
through the bare branches, as if weeping at the suffering it caused.Many, to keep from freezing, never lay down, but kept up a weary march,
so that the blood might circulate.A council of war was
held, and it was resolved that in the morning they would cut their way
through the lines of steel which Grant had thrown around them.All
preparations were made, every order given, and then they waited for the
light of morning--the last morning that hundreds would ever see.It was hardly light when Fred was awakened by the fitful sound of
musketry over on the right.In front of Wallace's division only the
report of a rifle of a picket was heard now and then.Hurriedly eating a
little breakfast, he mounted his horse and reported to General Cruft for
duty.The men were all standing at arms, but there was nothing for them
to do.But over on the right the rattle of musketry grew more intense,
the roll of heavy volleys began to be heard, and then the deep-voiced
cannon joined in the chorus.Louder and louder grew the din of the
conflict.The smoke of battle began to ascend above the treetops like
smoke from a burning coal-pit.The sound of battle came nearer, the roll
of musketry was incessant, the thunder of cannon never ceased.An officer wild with excitement came spurring his foaming horse up to
General Wallace."General McClernand wants help," he gasped."The whole Rebel army has
attacked his division.""I have orders from General Grant to hold this position at all hazards,"
replied Wallace.To Grant's headquarters the officer rides in frantic haste.The general
was away; he had started at five o'clock to see Commodore Foote, who had
been wounded in the battle of the night before, and was on board of one
of his gunboats, and the boats lay some five or six miles below.Would not some one of his staff give orders to send reinforcements to
McClernand.The officer groaned,
and rode back to McClernand with the heavy tidings.Minutes go by, the thunder of battle is terrific.The exultant cheering of the advancing foe is heard above the
roar of conflict.Another officer, with his horse bleeding from wounds, his hat gone, and
tears streaming down his face, rides to General Wallace."For God's
sake, help!"he gasps, "or everything is lost; we are flanked, we cannot
hold out longer."Then General Wallace said: "I will take the responsibility; help you
shall have."And with his face lighted up with joy the officer dashed
back to tell McClernand that help was coming.An order comes to General Cruft to at once march his brigade to the
scene of action.No sooner is the command given than the brigade is on
the way.Soon shot and shell are crashing overhead, and singing bullets
begin to cut the twigs of the bushes around.Now and then a soldier
falters and goes down.A smooth-faced, florid man rides up to General
Cruft."I am Colonel Oglesby," he says; "my brigade is being flanked on
the right.Let me lead you in position; my men are nearly out of
ammunition."And then as calmly as if on parade Colonel Dick Oglesby
leads Cruft's brigade to the relief of his men.Soon the brigade is in
the midst of the conflict.The excitement of battle is on him, and he feels no fear.Oglesby's brigade is out of ammunition.Sullenly his men fall back,
leaving over 800 of their number dead and wounded on the field, but his
left regiment refuses to go.The colonel, a large, dark man, with hair
as black as midnight, eyes like flaming stars, rages up and down the
line like a lion.Fred asks of a wounded soldier hobbling back."Colonel John A. Logan," is the answer.At last his men are out of ammunition, and Logan, bleeding from two
wounds, is obliged to lead his regiment back.Another regiment takes its
place, and after a dreadful conflict, is compelled to fall back, leaving
over 300 of their number dead and wounded.Cruft's brigade was now on the extreme right, cut off from the rest of
the army.The enemy pressed upon them; a withering volley sent them
reeling back.Fred spurred forward, and seizing
the colors of a Kentucky regiment, shouted: "Now, boys, for the honor of
old Kentucky."But on either flank
the enemy pressed, and the brigade, combating every foot, was forced
back.The enemy had gained the desired end; McClernand's division was out of
the way, the road to retreat was open.Because of the imbecility of Generals Floyd and Pillow.Broken, and with a third of its number dead and wounded, McClernand's
division is driven back on Lew Wallace.Officers, stunned with the
disaster, come wildly galloping through Wallace's lines, shouting, "All
is lost!Wallace changes front to meet the exultant, advancing foe.Firm as
adamant his lines stand.In the faces of the charging Confederates his
men pour their crushing volleys.The enemy waver, reel, then go
staggering, bleeding back.In conference with Commodore Foote on
board of a gunboat six miles down the river.He is too far away to hear
the roll of musketry, and the thunder of artillery he thinks but
cannonading between the two lines.It is past noon when the conference
is ended and he is rowed ashore.There stands a staff officer with
bloodless face and shaking limbs.In a few words the story of the
disaster is told.Without a word Grant listens, and then mounts his
horse.The iron shoes of his steed strike fire on the frozen ground as
he gallops back.He arrives just as the foe is repulsed by Wallace's
division."Why, boys," he cries, "they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."[Illustration: "Why, boys, they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."]The words act like magic as they are borne along the lines.Cartridge
boxes are replenished, and the soldiers, who a few moments before were
in retreat, are now eager to advance.The lines are re-formed and the
army sweeps forward.This time it is the Confederates who are pressed
back, and soon the open road is closed.The chance to escape is forever
gone; Fort Donelson is doomed.Darkness once more came, and with it another night of cold and
suffering.The early morning light showed a white flag floating from the
ramparts of the fort.Cold and hunger were
forgotten, as the soldiers in their joy embraced each other, and their
shouts of victory rose and fell like the swells of the ocean.The first
great victory of the war had been won.The storm of the elements, as well
as of battle, had passed away.On the
frozen ground lay the dead with white, pinched faces.Scores of the
wounded had perished from cold and exposure.Some who still breathed
were frozen to the ground in their own blood.The cold had been more
cruel than the bullets.Fred rode over the battlefield seeking the body of an officer in one of
the Kentucky regiments whom he had seen fall.The officer was a friend
of his father's.Where the last fierce struggle took place before the
brigade fell back, Fred found him.He was half-reclining against a tree,
and from its branches the snow had sifted down, as though trying to blot
out the crimson with a mantle of white.The officer had not died at
once, for the frozen hand held a photograph in its iron grasp--that of a
happy, sweet-faced mother holding a cooing babe.It was the photograph
of his wife and child.With a sob Fred turned away, sick--sick at heart.He was choking with
the horror that he saw.Fred's gallant act in leading the charge had been noticed by General
Cruft, and at the first opportunity he highly complimented his youthful
aid.But to Fred it now all seemed like a dream--something not real.Could it be that only yesterday he was in that hell of fire, eager only
to kill and maim!In the afternoon he went to see the prisoners mustered.As they marched
along with downcast eyes, Fred saw a well-known form among the officers
which sent every particle of blood from his face.Quickly recovering
himself, he sprang forward, exclaiming, "Uncle Charles!"Major Shackelford looked up in surprise, a frown came over his face, but
he held out his hand, and said, "Fred, you here?""Is--is father--a--prisoner--or--killed?"Fred's voice trembled, then
broke; he could not articulate another word."Your father is not here, thank God!""He is with
Johnston at Bowling Green."He now noticed for the first time a young lieutenant, his neat uniform
soiled and torn, and his eyes red with watching."Why, Cousin George, you here, too?"exclaimed Fred, holding out his
hand."I refuse," said he, "to take the hand of a traitor to his State and
kindred."The hot blood flew to Fred's face, and he was on the point of making an
angry retort, but controlling himself, he replied, "As you please," and
turned away."Uncle Charles," he said, "I know you will not be so foolish.I am
sorry--so sorry--to see you here."You surely fought like heroes," gently replied Fred."There is no
disgrace in brave men bowing to the inevitable.""And that fight was the worst of it," bitterly replied the major."Every
noble life lost was a useless sacrifice, sacrificed to the imbecility of
our generals.But, Fred, this surrender means more; it means the giving
up of Nashville.They will be wild with fear; they will flee penniless--flee I know not
where."Fred remained in deep thought for a moment, then looking up, said:
"Uncle, do you really fear for Aunt Jennie and the children?"Nashville will be wild--terror-stricken; there is no knowing what
will happen.""Uncle, if you wish, I will go to Nashville.Even if the city is taken,
there will be no danger.As
you say, the greatest danger is in flight.""Also write a statement for me," said Fred, "saying I am your nephew,
and that I am trying to reach your family in Nashville.A little later the letters were placed in Fred's hands, and bidding his
uncle a most affectionate farewell, he went to make preparations for his
journey.The next morning, provided with an order from General Grant
giving him permission to pass outside of the lines, he started.When he
was well beyond the pickets, he tore up his pass, thus destroying any
evidence that he was ever connected with the Federal army.He had not ridden many miles before he began to overtake straggling
Confederate soldiers who had escaped from Donelson.Along in the
afternoon he suddenly came upon three cavalrymen.The horse of one had
given out, and the three were debating what was best to do.Seeing Fred,
and noticing that he was well mounted, one of them said: "There comes a
boy, a civilian, on a fine hoss.Why not confiscate him for the good of
the cause?"Without warning, Fred found
himself covered by three revolvers."Come, young man," said one of the soldiers, threateningly, "off of
that hoss, and be quick about it, too.""It means the Confederate States of America have use for that hoss; so
climb down quick, and none of your lip.""But, gentlemen----"

"No buts about it," broke in the soldier fiercely."Do you mean to say
you refuse to contribute a hoss to the cause?You ought to be in the
ranks yourself instead of whining about a hoss.You must be a Lincolnite
or a coward.Get off, or I will let daylight through your carcass."There was no use parleying; so without saying a word Fred dismounted.The soldier in great glee, congratulating himself on his good fortune,
mounted.Prince laid back his ears, and a wicked gleam came into his
eyes, but as Fred said nothing, the horse made no objection."Say, boy," exclaimed the soldier, "you can have my hoss there; it's a
fair trade, you see," and with a laugh and a jeer they rode away.Fred let them go a short distance, when he suddenly gave a peculiar
short whistle.Prince gave a great bound, then wheeled as quick as
lightning.His rider was thrown with prodigious force, and lay senseless
in the road.At full speed the horse ran back and stopped by the side of
his owner, quivering with excitement.Fred vaulted into the saddle, and
with a yell of defiance dashed back in the direction he had come.Coming to a cross road, he followed it until he came to a road leading
in the direction he wished to go.Prince, old fellow, that was a trick those fellows weren't on to,"
said Fred, patting the glossy neck of his horse."You did it capitally,
my boy, capitally."Prince turned his head and whinnied as if he knew all about it.Towards evening Fred fell in with some of Forest's troopers who had
escaped from Donelson and were making their way to Nashville.The officer in command asked Fred who he was and where he was going, and
was frankly told."I know Major Shackelford well," replied the officer, "an honorable man
and a gallant soldier.I shall be happy to have you accompany us to
Nashville."Fred preferred to make more haste, but remembering his adventure,
resolved to run no more risk, and so gladly accepted the invitation.The news of the surrender of Fort Donelson had become known, and the
whole country was wild with terror.Consternation was depicted in every
countenance.For the first time the people of the South began to realize
that after all they might be defeated.When Fred entered Nashville the scene was indescribable.The whole city
was terror-stricken.Women walked the streets wringing their hands in
the agony of despair.Every avenue was blocked with vehicles of all
kinds, loaded with valuables and household goods.The inhabitants were
fleeing from what they considered destruction.Sobs and groans and
piteous wails were heard on every side.Could this be the same people he
had seen a few months before?Through the wild confusion, Fred rode
until he reached the door of his uncle's house.He found the family
preparing for hasty flight."Aunt Jennie, how are you?"Shackelford gave a shriek, and then exclaimed: "Fred Shackelford!"From Donelson and Uncle Charles," replied Fred.Shackelford turned as white as death, tottered, and would have
fallen if Fred had not caught her."Calm yourself, Aunt Jennie; both Uncle Charles and George are well."Shackelford, and tears came to the relief of
her pent-up feelings.they will die in some Northern prison, and I
shall never see them again."In all probability they will be exchanged in a
few weeks or released on parole.It will do you good to read it," and he handed her the letter her
husband had written.When she had read it, she became calmer, and said, "He wishes me to stay
here.""By all means, Aunt Jennie," replied Fred."Stop these preparations for
flight; be discreet, and you will be as safe in Nashville with the
Northern soldiers here as if they were a thousand miles away."Just then Kate came in, her vivacity all gone, and her eyes red with
weeping.she asked in surprise and with some hauteur.When I heard of it I vowed I would never
speak to you again.""But you see you have," replied Fred, smiling.she asked, ignoring Fred's
remark."Drive them back with broomsticks," replied Fred, mischievously.asked Kate, opening her eyes in astonishment."My pretty cousin, didn't you tell me when I was here that if the
Yankees ever dare come near Nashville the women would turn out and beat
them back with broomsticks?""I will never speak to you again; so
there!"But when Kate learned that Fred had just come from her father and
brother she was eager enough to talk, and Fred had to tell the story of
Donelson over and over again.As they were talking, the clatter of
horse's hoofs attracted the attention of the family, and Fred, glancing
out of the window, saw his father dismounting before the door.He arose trembling in every limb, and gasped:

"Aunt Jennie, my father!I cannot meet him; he has forbidden it," and he
passed into another room.Colonel Shackelford entered, and was warmly greeted by his
sister-in-law.He had but a moment to stay, as his regiment was on the
retreat, and the Federals were reported in close pursuit."I see," said he, "you have prepared for flight.I trust that you will
accompany my command until you reach a place of safety."Shackelford, "but have changed our minds.I have just received a letter from Charles, who is a prisoner, and he
has advised me to stay.""Charles a prisoner, and a letter from him!Colonel Shackelford asked in surprise.Shackelford hesitated a moment, and then answered, "Fred brought
it."The colonel started violently, and then asked in a broken voice, "Fred
here?"Shackelford had to tell all she knew."I will see him," said the colonel.Fred was told his father wished to see him; his heart gave a great
bound, as he rushed into the room with the cry of "Father!"on his lips,
and was about to spring into his arms when the stern command of "Stop!"rooted him, as it were, to the floor."Before you call me father," said the colonel, sternly, "I want to know
whether you have repented of your folly, or whether you are here as a
spy.If I thought the latter, as sure as there is a God in heaven I
would be tempted to give you up to the authorities to be hanged."If a dagger had pierced Fred's heart it would not have caused him keener
pain than the words of his father.He stood for a moment as if deprived
of the power of speech.Then the angry surges of an outraged nature came
to his relief, and his whole soul arose in protest to the indignity put
upon him."I have neither repented of my folly, as you call it," he replied
fiercely, "nor am I here as a spy.I came here on an errand of mercy at
the earnest request of Uncle Charles.Denounce me as a spy if you
choose; the act can be no more cruel than your words," and Fred turned
and left the room.Shackelford, "are you not too severe with the
boy?At extreme peril to himself he brought a letter from Charles, and
his coming has been a great comfort to me."Colonel Shackelford passed his hands before his eyes, and then groped
for a chair as if he had been smitten with blindness."Jennie," he replied in a low voice, trembling with emotion, "you do not
know the agony the course of that boy has caused me.But I am half-crazed over
the terrible disaster at Donelson.In a few days, at the most, the
Northern horde will be here in Nashville.But," and his face lighted up
with enthusiasm, "all is not lost, Jennie; we will soon be back.I know
something of the plans of General Johnston.The army will concentrate
somewhere along the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
probably at Corinth, and then before Grant and Buell can combine we will
crush them in detail.They think Donelson has broken our spirit; they
will find out differently."Fred being only in the next room, heard these words, and they made a
deep impression on his mind.Colonel Shackelford soon took his leave, bidding his sister-in-law keep
up courage, as the Northern army would soon be hurled back.The panic in Nashville kept up until February 25th, when, to Fred's joy,
General Nelson's division came steaming up the river, and the city was
occupied by the Federal army.The stars and stripes once more floated
over the State capitol, and never again were they hauled down.The alarm in Nashville in a great measure subsided, and business once
more resumed its way.As for Fred, his delight at meeting General Nelson so soon was
unbounded.He had come to look upon him almost as a father, and the
fiery old fellow returned his affection.Fred told the general of his aunt, and received the promise that he
would see that she was not molested or annoyed in any manner, and this
promise was religiously kept.As long as he remained in Nashville Fred made his home at the house of
his aunt, and, notwithstanding his Yankee proclivities, became as great
a favorite with his cousin Kate as ever.When the time came for Buell to
advance, the family parted with Fred almost as affectionately as though
he had been one of them; and their sincere prayers followed him that he
might be preserved from the dangers of war.A few days after the surrender of Fort Donelson General Grant was
relieved of his command, and was even threatened with arrest.General
Halleck, in his headquarters at St.Louis, had worked himself into a fit
of what he considered most righteous anger.General Buell had ordered
one of Grant's divisions to Nashville, and Grant had taken a trip to
that city to find out the reason for the order.During his absence some
irregularities had occurred at Donelson, and Grant was most viciously
attacked by some anonymous scribbler, and then by the press.He was
accused of being absent from his command without leave, of drunkenness,
of maintaining no discipline, and of refusing to forward reports.The telegraph operator at
Fort Henry was a Confederate in disguise.He coolly pocketed Halleck's
dispatches to Grant.He held his position for some days, and then fled
south with his pocket full of dispatches.General Grant was relieved of
his command, and General C. F. Smith, a gray-haired veteran, who smoked
a cigar as he led his men in the charge at Donelson, was appointed in
his place.The feeling against Grant was so bitter at headquarters, that
General McClellan telegraphed to General Halleck to arrest him if he
thought best.The hero of Donelson deeply felt his disgrace, yet wrote to General
Smith:

"Allow me to congratulate you on your richly deserved promotion, and to
assure you that no one can feel more pleasure than myself."Even General Halleck was at length convinced of the injustice he had
done Grant, and restored him to his command on March 13th.In the mean time Grant's army, under Smith, had been gathering at
Pittsburg Landing, and Buell's army had been concentrated at Nashville.The two armies were to concentrate at Pittsburg Landing, and then move
on Corinth, where the Confederates were gathering in force.Not a thought seemed to have entered the minds of the Union generals
that the army at Pittsburg Landing might be attacked before Buell could
come up.Halleck, Grant, Buell, Smith, Sherman--all seemed to rest in
fancied security.If the possibility of an attack was ever spoken of, it
was passed by as idle talk.General Buell commenced his forward movement from Nashville on March
15th.General A. D. McCook's division had the advance, General Nelson's
division came next.The bridge over Duck river near Columbia was found
burned.Buell set to work leisurely to rebuild it.Just before the army left Nashville, General
Nelson placed in his hands a parchment."This," said Nelson, "is what General Buell and myself were talking
about in Louisville as a small reward for your service.Take it, my boy,
for you richly deserve it."It was a commission as captain, and detailed him as an independent
scout, subject to the orders of General William Nelson."Why, General," stammered Fred, "I didn't want this.You know, you told
me it was better for me not to enlist.""I know," responded Nelson, "but as you are with the army so much, it is
better for you to wear a uniform and have a rank that will command
respect."So Fred became "captain" in earnest.During his conversations with Nelson, Fred told him what he had heard
his father say to his aunt about Grant and Buell being crushed in
detail, and the general became thoroughly imbued with the idea that the
army at Pittsburg Landing was in grave danger.He chafed like a caged tiger at the delay in crossing Duck
river.At length he sought Buell, who laughed at his fears, and said
that he would not move until the bridge was completed."Why, Nelson, what's the matter with you any way?""Here we have been puttering
with this bridge for nearly a week, and all this time the force at
Pittsburg Landing is in danger of being attacked and annihilated."Buell leaned back in his chair, and looking quizzically at Nelson, said:

"You seem to know more about it, General, than either Halleck or Grant.Halleck telegraphed me that there is no danger of the force at Pittsburg
Landing being attacked.""I don't care what Halleck telegraphs," roared Nelson, now thoroughly
aroused."I tell you there is; I feel it, I know it."asked Buell, showing considerable interest.A small force encamped only
twenty miles from Corinth, where Johnston is concentrating his army.Johnston is a fool if he doesn't attack, and no one yet has ever accused
him of being one.General, give my division the advance; let me ford
Duck river."Buell was really fond of Nelson, despite his rough, overbearing ways,
and after some hesitation gave him the required permission.The life of
General Grant might not read as it does now, if that permission had been
withheld.On the morning of March 29th Nelson's division forded Duck river, and
started on its forced march for Savannah, on the Tennessee river.On
this march Nelson showed no mercy to stragglers, and many were the
curses heaped upon his head.One day Fred found a boy, no older than himself, lashed behind a cannon.The lad belonged to an Indiana regiment that in some manner had incurred
the displeasure of the general, and he was particularly severe on
members of this regiment if found straggling.The boy in question had
been found away from his command, and had been tied by his wrists to a
cannon.Behind this gun he had to march through the mud, every jolt
sending sharp pain through his wrists and arms, and if he should fall
life itself would be imperiled.It was a heartless, and in this case,
cruel punishment.Fred noticed the boy, and rode up to him and asked him
his name, and he gave it as Hugh Raymond.He was a fine-looking fellow,
and seemed to feel deeply his humiliation.He was covered with mud, and
the tears that he could not hold back had left their dirty trail down
his cheeks.Fred went to Nelson, begged for the boy's release, and got
it.It was but few requests that Nelson would not grant Fred.When Nelson started on his march to Savannah he expected to reach that
place on April 7th.But once on the march his eagerness increased, and
he resolved to reach Savannah, if possible, by the 4th, or at least the
5th of the month.On the morning of the third day's march Fred met with an adventure that
haunted him for years afterward.He never thought of it without a
shudder, and over and over again he lived it in his dreams, awaking with
a cry of agony that sounded unearthly to those who heard it.General Nelson and staff had put up at the commodious house of a planter
named Lane.They were most hospitably entertained, although Mr.Lane
made no secret of the fact that he was an ardent sympathizer with the
South.In the morning, as Fred was about to mount his horse to resume the
march, he discovered that he had left his field-glass in the room he had
occupied during the night.On returning for it, he heard voices in the
next room, one of which sounded so familiar that he stopped a moment to
listen, and to his amazement recognized the voice of his cousin Calhoun.One thing was certain; he
had been exchanged and was once more in the army.Lane
were engaged in earnest conversation, and Fred soon learned that his
cousin had been concealed in the house during the night."I have," replied Calhoun, "thanks to your kindness.I heard Nelson say
he would rush his division through, and that he wanted to be in Savannah
by the 5th.Johnston must,
shall strike Grant before that time.I must be in Corinth within the
next twenty-four hours, if I kill a dozen horses in getting there.Is
my horse where I left him, at the stable in the woods?"Lane; "and well cared for and groomed.But
breakfast is ready; you must eat a hearty meal before you start."Fred realized that the fate of an army was at stake.Something must be
done, and that something must be done quickly.Slipping out of the
house, he took a look around.Back of the house about a half a mile
distant was a thick piece of wood.A lane led through the fields to this
wood.No doubt it was there that Calhoun's horse was concealed.Fred quickly made up his mind what to do.Mounting his horse, he rode
rapidly away until out of sight of the house; then, making Prince jump
the fence, he rode through the field until he reached the wood, and then
back nearly to the lane he had noticed.Tying his horse, he crept close
to the path, and concealed himself.He soon saw
Calhoun coming up the path with quick, springing steps.To Fred's great
joy he was alone.He let him pass, and then stealthily as an Indian
followed him.Calhoun soon reached the rude stable, and went in."Now, my hearty," said he, as he patted his horse, "we have a long hard
ride before us.But we carry news, my boy--news that may mean
independence to the Sunny South."Strong arms were suddenly thrown around him, and despite his desperate
resistance and struggles, he soon found himself lying on his face, his
hands held behind his back and securely tied.His ankles were then
firmly bound together.When all this was done he was raised to his feet
and a voice said:

"Sorry, Cal, but I had to do it," and to Calhoun's amazement his cousin
stood before him, panting from his exertion.For a moment Calhoun was speechless with astonishment; then his rage
knew no limit, and bound as he was, he tried to get at his cousin."I reckon," said Fred, quietly, "that I must make you more secure," and
taking a stout strap he lashed him securely to a post."Is this the way you keep your oath?"hissed Calhoun, and he spat at
Fred in his contempt."Loose me, you sneaking villain, loose me at once,
or I will raise an alarm, and Mr.Lane and his men will be here, and
they will make short work of you."Just then the notes of a bugle, sweet and clear, came floating through
the air."You had better raise no alarm;
McCook's division is passing, and I have but to say a word and you
swing."Calhoun ground his teeth in impotent rage.At last he asked:

"Fred, what do you want?Have you not sworn to
guard my life as sacredly as your own?"Fred stood looking at his cousin a moment, as if in deep thought; then
an expression of keenest pain came over his face, and he said in a
strained, unnatural voice:

"Calhoun, believe me, I would I were dead instead of standing before you
as I do now.""I should think that you would, if you have a vestige of honor left,"
answered Calhoun, with a sneer."An oath, which an honorable man would
hold more sacred than life itself seems to be lightly regarded by you.""I shall come to that directly," replied Fred, in the same unnatural
tone.To him his voice sounded afar off, as if some one else were
talking."Now, Calhoun, listen; you have a secret, a secret on which the fate of
an army depends."Calhoun, you have been
playing the spy again.do you hear the tramp of McCook's columns.If I did my duty I would cry, 'Here is a spy,' and what then?"Calhoun's face grew ashen; then his natural bravery came to his rescue."I defy you," he exclaimed, his eyes flaming with wrath."Hang me if you
will, and then in the sight of God behold yourself a murderer worse than
Cain.""Calhoun, once more I say, listen.The information that you have you
shall not take to Johnston.What I do now
would hang me instead of you, if Buell knew.But I trust you with more
than life; I trust you with my honor.Give me your sacred word that you
will keep away from Corinth until after Buell and Grant have joined
forces; promise as sacredly that you will not directly or indirectly
divulge in any manner to any person the knowledge you have gained, and I
will release you."Calhoun looked Fred in the face, hesitated, and then slowly answered:
"You seem to think I have more honor and will keep an oath better than
yourself."Calhoun," he cried, "you do not, you cannot mean
it.Promise, for the love of heaven,
promise!""I will not promise, I will die first," replied Calhoun, doggedly.A
faint hope was arising in his mind that Fred was only trying to frighten
him; that he had only to remain firm, and that, at the worst, Fred would
only try to keep him a prisoner.Calhoun's words were to Fred as a sentence of death.He sank on his
knees, and lifted his hands imploringly."Calhoun," he moaned, "see me, see me here at your feet.It is I, not
you, who is to be pitied.For the love we bear each other"--at the word
"love" Calhoun's lips curled in contempt--"for the sake of those near
and dear to us, for the honor of our names, promise, oh, promise me!"See, I spit on you, I despise you, defy
you.""Then you must die," replied Fred, slowly rising to his feet."Fred, you will not give me up to be
hanged?""No, Calhoun, your dishonor would be my dishonor.I cannot keep my oath,
and have you hanged as a spy.""I shall shoot you with my own hand.""You do not, cannot mean
that?""It is the only way I can keep my oath and still prevent you from
carrying the news that would mean destruction to Grant's army."How can you keep your oath by
murdering me?""Calhoun, I swore to consider your honor as sacred as my own, to value
your life as highly as my own, to share with you whatever fate might
come.After I put a bullet through your heart, I
shall put one through my own brain._We both must die._"

Calhoun's face seemed frozen with horror.He gasped and tried to speak,
but no words came."Calhoun," continued Fred, in a tone that sounded as a voice from one
dead, "would that you had promised, for it can do no good not to
promise.Now, say your prayers, for in a
moment we both will be standing before our Maker."Fred bowed his head in silent prayer; but Calhoun, with his
horror-stricken face, never took his eyes from off his cousin."Good-bye, Calhoun," said Fred, as he raised his revolver."For God's sake, don't shoot!The words seemed to explode
from Calhoun's lips.[Illustration: "For God's Sake, don't shoot!For a moment Fred stood as motionless as a statue, with the revolver
raised; then the weapon dropped from his nerveless hand, and with a low
moan he plunged forward on his face.So long did he lie in a swoon that Calhoun thought he was dead, and
called to him in the most endearing tones.At last there was a slight
quivering of the limbs, then he began to moan; finally he sat up and
looked around as one dazed.Seeing Calhoun, he started, passed his hand
across his brow as if to collect his thoughts, and said, as if in
surprise: "Why, Calhoun----" Then it all came back to him in its terror
and awfulness, and he fell back sick and faint.Rallying, he struggled
to his feet, tottered to Calhoun, and cut the bonds that bound him."It will not do for us to be found here
together."The two boys clasped hands for a moment, then each turned and went his
separate way.When Fred joined Nelson an hour later the general looked at him sharply,
and asked: "What's the matter, Fred?You look ten years
older than you did yesterday.""I am not really sick, but I am not feeling well, General," replied
Fred; "and I believe, with your permission, I will take an ambulance for
the rest of the day.""Do, Fred, do," kindly replied Nelson, and for the rest of the day Fred
rode in an ambulance, where he could be alone with his thoughts.That evening he asked General Nelson when he expected the division would
reach Savannah."By the 5th, if possible, on the 6th anyway," answered the general."Make it the 5th, General; don't let anything stop you; hurry!Nelson looked after him and muttered: "I wonder what's the matter with
the boy; he hasn't appeared himself to-day; but it may be he will be all
right in the morning.I shall take his advice and hurry, anyway."The next day Nelson urged on his men with a fury that caused the air to
be blue with oaths.And it was well that he did, or Shiloh would have
never been reached in time to aid the gallant soldiers of Grant.Buell saw no need of hurrying.He thought it would be a fine thing to
concentrate his whole army at Waynesborough and march into Savannah with
flying colors, showing Grant what a grand army he had.He telegraphed
General Halleck for permission to do so, and the request was readily
granted.In some manner it became known to the Confederate spies that
Buell's army was to halt at Waynesborough, and the glad tidings were
quickly borne to General Johnston, and when that general marched forth
to battle he had no expectation that he would have to meet any of
Buell's men.General Buell hurried forward to stop Nelson at Waynesborough, according
to his plan; but to his chagrin he found that Nelson, in his headlong
haste, was already beyond Waynesborough, and so the plan of stopping him
had to be given up.When General Nelson's advance was a little beyond Waynesborough, a party
engaged in the construction of a telegraph line from Savannah to
Nashville was met.A telegram was handed their general, which read:


     TO THE OFFICER COMMANDING BUELL'S ADVANCE:

     There is no need of haste; come on by easy stages.U. S. GRANT,
     Major-General Commanding.Nelson read the telegram, and turning to Fred said:

"This is small comfort for all my hurry.I wonder if I have made a fool
of myself, after all.Buell will have the joke on me, sure.""Better be that way than have you needed and not there," answered Fred."If we are needed and are not there, Grant can only blame himself," was
Nelson's reply.At noon on April 5th Ammen's brigade, the advance of Nelson's division,
marched into Savannah.Colonel Ammen reported his arrival, and said:

"My men are not tired; we can march on to Pittsburg Landing if
necessary."The answer was: "Rest, and make your men comfortable.There will be no
battle at Pittsburg Landing.Boats will be sent for you in a day or
two."There was to be a rude awakening on the morrow."The sun of Austerlitz" was neither brighter nor more glorious than the
sun which arose over the field of Shiloh Sunday morning, April 6, 1862.Around the little log chapel, wont to echo to the voice of prayer and
song of praise, along the hillsides and in the woods, lay encamped the
Federal army.The soldiers had lain down the night before without a
thought of what this bright, sunny Sabbath would bring forth.A sense of
security pervaded the whole army.From commander down to private, there
was scarcely a thought of an attack."I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack," wrote Grant to Halleck
on April 5th.On the evening of the same day Sherman wrote to Grant: "I do not
apprehend anything like an attack upon our position."Yet when these words were written the Confederate army was in battle
array not much over three miles distant.But there was one general in the Federal army who was uneasy, he hardly
knew why.He was little known at the time, he never held a
distinguished command afterward; yet it was by his vigilance that the
Federal army was saved from surprise, perhaps from capture.A vague idea that something was wrong haunted him.The
ominous silence in front oppressed him, as something to be feared.An unusual number of squirrels and
rabbits were noticed dodging through the line, and they were all headed
in one direction--toward Pittsburg Landing.To guard more surely against surprise Prentiss posted his pickets a mile
and a half in front of his lines, an unusual distance.At three o'clock
Sunday morning he sent three companies of the Twenty-fifth Missouri out
on a reconnoitering expedition.These three companies followed a road
that obliqued to the right, and a little after daylight met the enemy's
advance in front of Sherman's division.Thus the battle of Shiloh
opened.When the first shots were fired, Preston Johnston, son of the
Confederate commander, looked at his watch, and it was just fourteen
minutes past five o'clock.This little advance band must have made a brave fight, for Major
Hardcastle, in command of the Confederate outposts, reports that he
fought a thousand men an hour.It was after six o'clock when the general
advance of the whole Confederate army commenced, and the pickets along
the line of Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions were driven in.Preston
Johnston states that it was seven o'clock when the first cannon shot was
fired.It was eight o'clock before the engagement became general along
the whole line, and at that time portions of Prentiss' division had been
fighting for nearly three hours.General Grant was at breakfast in Savannah, nine miles away, when he was
startled by the booming of cannon in the direction of Shiloh.Hastily
writing an order to General Nelson to procure a guide and march his
division up the river to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, Grant left
his breakfast half-eaten, and boarding his dispatch boat was soon
steaming up the river.His fear was that the isolated division of
General Lewis Wallace, which lay at Crump's Landing, had been attacked.Finding this not to be the case when he reached Crump's, he bade Wallace
hold his division in readiness and to await orders, and steamed on.Turning to Rawlins, his
chief-of-staff, Grant said:

"Rawlins, I am afraid this is a general attack.Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions are in front, and both are composed of
raw troops; but if we can hold them until Wallace and Nelson come we are
all right.""It is a pity you did not order Wallace up when you were there,"
answered Rawlins."Yes," answered Grant, "but I couldn't make up my mind it was a general
attack."It sounds very much like it," replied Rawlins, grimly.When Grant reached the landing the battle was raging furiously, and all
doubts as to its being a general attack were removed from his mind.Already the vanguard of what was afterward an army of panic-stricken men
had commenced gathering under the river bank.A staff officer was sent back immediately to order General Wallace to
come at once.Grant then set to work quickly to do what he could to stem
the tide, which was already turning against him.Two or three regiments
which had just landed he ordered to points where they were the most
needed.He then rode the entire length of the line, encouraging his
generals, telling them to stand firm until Wallace and Nelson came, and
all would be well.Some of his regiments
had broken at the first fire, and fled panic-stricken to the Landing.Sherman was straining every nerve to hold his men firm.Oblivious of
danger, he rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved, encouraging,
pleading, threatening, as the case might be.Grant cautioned him to be
careful, and not expose himself unnecessarily, but Sherman answered: "If
I can stem the tide by sacrificing my life, I will willingly do it."Then turning to Grant, he said, with feeling: "General, I did not
expect this; forgive me.""I am your senior general," answered Sherman."You depended on me for
reports; I quieted your fears.I reported there was no danger of an
attack.I couldn't believe it this morning until my orderly was shot by
my side, and I saw the long lines of the enemy sweeping forward."There is nothing to forgive," he said, gently."The mistake is mine as well as yours.If I had, I could have had Buell here.As it is, Wallace and Nelson will
soon be here, and we will whip them; never fear."By ten o'clock Prentiss had been pushed back clear through and beyond
his camp, and had taken position along a sunken road.General W. H. L.
Wallace's division came up and joined him on the right.This part of the
field was afterward known as the "Hornet's Nest."Here Grant visited them, and seeing the strength of the position, told
them to hold it to the last man."We will," responded both Wallace and Prentiss.For hours the Confederate lines beat
against them like the waves of the ocean, only to be flung back torn and
bleeding.Both flanks of the Federal army
were bent back like a bow.Every moment the number of panic-stricken
soldiers under the bank grew larger.Noon came, but no Lew Wallace, no Nelson.Turning to an aid, Grant said:
"Go for Wallace; bid him hurry, hurry."Everywhere, except in the center, the Confederates were pressing the
Union lines back.But the desperate resistance offered surprised
Johnston; he had expected an easier victory.Many of his best regiments
had been cut to pieces.Thousands of his men had also fled to the rear.The afternoon was passing; the fighting must be pressed.A desperate effort was made to turn the Federal left flank, and thus
gain the Landing.Like iron Hurlbut's men stood, and time after time
hurled back the charging columns.At last the Confederates refused to
charge again.Then General Johnston placed himself at their head and
said: "I will lead you, my children."With wild cheers his men pressed forward;
nothing could withstand the fury of the charge.The Federal left was
crushed, hurled back to the Landing in a torn, disorganized mass.For a time the Confederate
army stood as if appalled at its great loss.The thunder of battle died
away, only to break out here and there in fitful bursts.But the
respite was brief, and then came the final desperate onslaught.With features as impassive as stone, Grant saw his army crumbling to
pieces.Officer after officer had been sent to see what had become of
General Lew Wallace; he should have been on the field hours before.With
anxious eyes Grant looked across the river to see if he could catch the
first fluttering banner of Nelson's division.An officer rides up, one of the messengers he had sent for Wallace.The officer
reports: "Wallace took the wrong road.I found him five miles further
from the Landing than when he started.Then he countermarched, instead
of hurrying forward left in front.Then he
is marching so slow, so slow.For an instant a spasm of pain passed over Grant's face."He
countermarched; coming slow," he said, as if to himself, "Great God,
what does he mean?"Turning to Colonel Webster, he said: "Plant the siege guns around the
Landing.See that you have every available piece of artillery in
position."And it was only this frowning line of artillery that stood between
Grant's army and utter rout."Have you any way of retreat mapped out?"Buell had come up from Savannah on a boat, and was now on the field,
viewing with consternation and alarm the tremendous evidences of
demoralization and defeat.Turning to him as quick as a flash, Grant replied: "Retreat!I
have not yet despaired of victory."Both the right and left wings of Grant's army were now crushed back from
the center.Around the flanks of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss'
divisions the exultant Confederates poured.Well had Wallace and
Prentiss obeyed the orders of Grant to hold their position.From ten
o'clock in the forenoon until nearly five o'clock in the afternoon their
lines had hurled back every attack of the enemy.The Hornet's Nest stung
every time it was touched.But now the divisions were hemmed in on every
side.The brave Wallace formed his men to cut their way out, and as he
was cheering them on he fell mortally wounded.No better soldier than
Wallace fell on that bloody field.As for the two divisions, they were
doomed.General Grant sits on his horse, watching the preparations for the last
stand.An officer, despair written in every lineament of his face, rides
up to him."General," he says, "Sherman reports that he has taken his last
position.He has but the remnant of one brigade with him and what
stragglers he has gathered."Go back," quietly said Grant, "and tell Sherman to hold if possible;
night is most here."McClernand's division had been standing bravely all day, and had
furnished fewer stragglers than any other division in the army, but now
an orderly with a pale face and his left arm resting in a bloody sling,
came spurring his reeking horse up to Grant, and exclaimed:

"General McClernand bade me report, that after his division had most
gallantly repulsed the last charge of the enemy, for some unaccountable
reason, the left regiments broke, and are fleeing panic-stricken to the
Landing.""Go tell McClernand," said Grant, "that he has done well, but he must
hold out just a little longer.General Hurlbut, his face black with the smoke of battle, rode up."General," he said, in a broken voice, "my division is gone, the whole
left is gone; the way to the Landing is open to the enemy.""General," replied Grant, without a quiver, "rally what broken regiments
and stragglers you can behind the guns, close up as much as possible on
McClernand, and hold your position to the last man."Now there came roaring past a confused mass of white-faced officers and
soldiers commingled, a human torrent stricken with deadly fear."Prentiss and Wallace have
surrendered.""Oh, for Lew Wallace, for Nelson, or
for night," he groaned.From across the river there came to his ears the sound of cheering.Grant looked, and there among the trees he saw the banners of Nelson's
regiments waving.Hope came into his eyes; his face lighted up.he cried to his aids, "go to Sherman, to McClernand, to
Hurlbut.But if Grant had known it the danger had already passed; for Beauregard
had given orders for his army to cease fighting.Night was coming on,
the capture of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss' divisions had
disarranged his lines, and thinking that he was sure of his prey in the
morning, he had given orders to withdraw.One brigade of the Confederate army did not receive this order, and when
Nelson's advance crossed the river this brigade was charging the line of
cannon on the left.These cannon were entirely unprotected by infantry,
and Grant himself placed Nelson's men in line as they arrived.The Confederate brigade was advancing with triumphant shouts, when they
were met with a withering volley and sent reeling back.Then, to his
surprise, the commander found that of all of the Confederate army his
brigade was the only one continuing the fight, and he hastily fell back.Alone and practically unaided the brave soldiers of the Army of the
Tennessee had fought the battle of Sunday and saved themselves from
capture.The battle of Monday was mainly the fight of the Army of the Ohio.Without its aid Grant could never have been able to turn defeat into
victory, and send the Confederate hosts in headlong flight back to
Corinth.There would have been no advance Monday morning if Buell had
not been on the field.The whole energy of Grant would have been devoted
to the saving of what remained of his army.The terrible conflict of the day had left its impress on the Army of the
Tennessee.There was but a remnant in line capable of battle when night
came.The generals of divisions were so disheartened that the coming of Buell
failed to restore their spirits.Even the lion-hearted Sherman wavered
and was downcast.Grant found him sitting in the darkness beside a tree,
his head buried in his hands, and his heart full of fears.Three horses had been shot under him, and he
had received two wounds.When Grant told him there was to be an advance
in the morning, he sadly shook his head and said: "No use, General, no
use; the fight is all out of the men.I do not possibly see how we can
assume the offensive."If we assume the offensive in the morning a glorious victory awaits us.Lew Wallace is here; Buell will have at least 20,000 fresh troops on the
field.The Confederates, like ourselves, are exhausted and demoralized.If we become the aggressors, success is sure."Sherman became convinced; his fears were gone, his hopes revived.Why was it that the fiery and impetuous Nelson was so late in getting on
the field?He was only nine miles away early in the morning, and had
received orders from Grant to move his division opposite Pittsburg
Landing.If there had been any roads there would have been no excuse for
his delay.But a heavily timbered, swampy bottom lay between him and his
destination.The river had been very high, overflowing the whole bottom,
and when the water had receded it left a waste of mud, from which all
vestige of a road had disappeared.To plunge into that waste of mud and
wilderness without a guide would have been madness.A guide, though
Grant said one could easily be found, could not be secured.So Nelson
sent a staff officer to see if he could find a practicable route.This
officer did not return until noon.All of this time the division lay
listening to the booming of cannon and eager to be led to the fray.As
for Nelson, he fretted and fumed, stormed and swore at the delay."The expected has come," he growled, "and here I am doing no more good
than if I were a hundred miles away.Might have been on the field, too,
if Grant had not kept saying, 'No use hurrying!'I knew they were a set
of fools to think that Johnston would sit down at Corinth and suck his
thumbs."At length a guide was found who said he could pilot the division
through the bottom, but that the route was passable only for horsemen
and infantry; the artillery would have to be left behind.The division
started at one o'clock, the men keeping step to the music of the thunder
of cannon."This beats Donelson," remarked Fred, as the roar of artillery never
ceased."My boy," replied Nelson, "the greatest battle ever fought on this
continent is now being waged.God grant that we may get there in time.It was rumored at Savannah that the Confederates were sweeping
everything before them.""Your division will surely give a good account of itself," said Fred,
looking back, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm."See how eager the men
are, and how well they keep closed up, notwithstanding the mud.Half of
them are mourning because they think the battle will be over before they
get there.""The question is, shall we be in
time."Soon the roll of musketry began to be heard; then the cheers of the
combatants.A quiver of excitement ran along the lines, and every
soldier grasped his musket with a firmer hold.As they approached the
river cannon balls began to crash through the treetops above them; then
was heard the peculiar whir of the minie ball when it is nearly
spent--so close was the fighting to the river.To Fred's surprise, he saw numerous skulkers dodging through the timber
on the same side of the river as himself.In some manner they had
managed to get across the river; not only this, but the boats which came
to ferry Nelson's troops over were more or less crowded with these
skulkers, who would have died rather than be driven off.In the river
were seen men on logs making their way across, and some of these men
wore shoulder straps.So incensed were Nelson's soldiers at the sight of such cowardice that
they begged for permission to shoot them.As they landed, Fred stood aghast at the sight before him.Cowering
beneath the high bank were thousands upon thousands of trembling
wretches.It was a dense mass of shivering, weeping, wailing, swearing,
praying humanity, each one lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but that dreadful fear which chained him soul and body.As Nelson's advance brigade forced its way through the panic-stricken
throng, they were greeted with, "You are all going to your death!"Don't touch my men; you
contaminate them; don't speak to them, you cowards, miscreants, you
should be swept from the face of the earth."And in the fury of his wrath, Nelson begged for the privilege of turning
cannon on them.With firm, unwavering steps, and well closed up, the division pressed
their way up the bank, and there were soldiers in the ranks who looked
with contempt on the shivering wretches below the hill, who themselves,
the next day, fled in terror from the awful destruction going on around
them.So little do we know ourselves and what we will do when the
supreme moment comes.Afterward the great majority of the soldiers who cowered under the bank
at Shiloh covered themselves with glory, and hundreds of them laid down
their lives for their country.From the Landing
came the groans and shrieks of the wounded, tortured under the knives of
the surgeons.The night was as dark and cloudy as the day had been
bright and clear.About eleven o'clock a torrent of rain fell, drenching
the living, and cooling the fevered brows of the wounded.Fred sat
against a tree, holding the bridle of his horse in his hand.If by
chance he fell asleep, he would be awakened by the great cannon of the
gunboats, which threw shells far inland every fifteen minutes.At the first dawn of day Nelson's division advanced, and the battle
began.Fred acted as aid to Nelson, and as the general watched him as he
rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved he would say to those around him:
"Just see that boy; there is the making of a hero."About eleven o'clock one of Nelson's brigades made a most gallant
charge.Wheeling to the right, the brigade swept the Confederate line
for more than half a mile.Before them the enemy fled, a panic-stricken
mob.A battery was run over as though the guns were blocks of wood,
instead of iron-throated monsters vomiting forth fire and death.In the
thickest of the fight, Fred noticed Robert Marsden, the betrothed of
Mabel Vaughn, cheering on his men.thought Fred, "he is worthy of Mabel.May his life be spared to
make her happy."On, on swept the brigade; a second battery was reached, and over one of
the guns he saw Marsden fighting like a tiger.Then the smoke of battle
hid him from view.On the left Fred saw a mere boy spring from out an Indiana regiment,
shoot down a Confederate color-bearer, snatch the colors from his dying
grasp, wave them defiantly in the face of the enemy, and then coolly
walk back to his place in the ranks.General Nelson saw the act, and turning to Fred, said: "I want you to
hunt that boy up, and bring him to me after the battle."But the brigade paid dearly for its daring charge.A strong line, lying
down, let the frightened fugitives pass over them; then they arose and
poured a deadly volley into the very faces of the charging column.Cannon in front and on the flank tore great gaps through the line.The
brigade halted, wavered, and then fled wildly back, leaving a third of
its number dead and wounded.By three o'clock the battle was over; the Confederates were in full
retreat, and the bloody field of Shiloh won.As the firing died away, Fred sat on his horse and shudderingly surveyed
the field.The muddy ground was trampled as by the feet of giants.The
forest was shattered as by ten thousand thunderbolts, while whole
thickets had been leveled, as though a huge jagged scythe had swept over
them.By tree and log, in every thicket, on every hillside, dotting every
field, lay the dead and wounded.Many of the dead were crushed out of
all semblance of humanity, trampled beneath the hoof of the warhorse or
ground beneath the ponderous wheels of the artillery.Over 20,000 men
lay dead and wounded, Confederate and Federal commingled.The fondest hopes of the Confederates had
been blasted; instead of marching triumphantly forward to Nashville, as
they hoped, they retreated sullenly back to Corinth.But the battle brought the war to the hearts of the people as it had
never been brought before.From the stricken homes of the North and the
South there arose a great wail of agony--a weeping for those who would
not return.On Monday morning, just as the first scattering shots of Nelson's
skirmishers were heard, Calhoun Pennington presented himself before the
Hon.G. M. Johnson, Provisional Governor of Kentucky, on whose staff he
was.When the Confederates retreated from Bowling Green Governor Johnson
accompanied the Kentucky brigade south, and although not a soldier he
had bravely fought throughout the entire battle of the day before.The Governor and General Beauregard were engaged in earnest conversation
when Calhoun came up, and both uttered an exclamation of surprise at his
forlorn appearance.He was pale and haggard, his eyes were sunken and
his garments were dripping with water, for he had just swum the
Tennessee river.cried Johnson, and he caught
Calhoun's hand and wrung it until he winced with pain."It is what is left of me," answered Calhoun, with a faint smile."You don't know," continued Johnson, "how glad I am to see you.I had
given you up for lost, and bitterly blamed myself for allowing you to
go on your dangerous undertaking."First," answered Calhoun, "I must speak to General Beauregard," and,
saluting, he said: "General, I bring you heavy news."I feared it, I feared it, when the
Federals opened the battle this morning.I was just telling the Governor
as you came up that Grant would never have assumed the offensive if he
had not been reinforced."said Calhoun, "if I had only been a couple of days earlier; if you
had only attacked a couple of days sooner!""That was the calculation," answered Beauregard, "but the dreadful roads
retarded us.Then we did not expect Buell for two or three days yet.Our
scouts brought us information that he was to halt at least a couple of
days at Waynesborough.""So he was," answered Calhoun, bitterly; "and he would have done so if
it had not been for that renegade Kentuckian, General Nelson.He it was
who rushed through, and made it possible for Buell to be on the field
to-day.""Do you know how many men Buell has?""Three strong divisions; I should say full 20,000.""I thank you,
Lieutenant, for your information, although it is the knell of defeat.Yesterday we fought for victory; to-day I shall have to fight to save my
army."So saying he mounted his horse and galloped rapidly to the scene
of action."This is bad news that you bring, Lieutenant," said the Governor, after
Beauregard had gone."But tell me about yourself; you must have been in
trouble."At first I was very successful, and
found out that Nelson expected to be in Savannah by April 5th.I was
just starting back with this important information, information which
meant victory for our cause, when I was suddenly set upon and captured
before I had time to raise a hand.I was accused of being a spy, but
there was no proof against me, the only person who could have convicted
me being a cousin, who refused to betray me; but he managed to hold me
until my knowledge could do no good.""It looks as though the hand of God were against us," solemnly responded
Johnson."If you had not been captured, we would surely have attacked a
day or two earlier, and a glorious victory would have awaited us.But
now----" the Governor paused, choked back something like a sob, and then
continued: "There is no use of vain regrets.See, the battle is on, and
I must once more take my place in the ranks and do my duty.""Must fight in the ranks as a private soldier, as I did yesterday,"
replied the Governor calmly."I shall go with you," replied Calhoun.So side by side the Governor and his aid fought as private soldiers, and
did yeoman service.Just before the battle closed, in repelling the last
furious charge of the Federals, Governor Johnson gave a sharp cry,
staggered, and would have fallen if he had not been caught in the arms
of Calhoun.Loving hands carried him back, but the brave spirit had fled
forever.Thus died the most distinguished private soldier that fell on
the field of Shiloh.One of the first acts of Fred after the battle was over was to ride in
search of Robert Marsden.He found him lying in a heap of slain at the
place where the battery had been charged.A bullet had pierced the
center of the miniature flag, and it was wet with his heart's blood.Reverently Fred removed the flag, closed the sightless eyes, and gave
orders that the body, as soon as possible, be sent to Louisville.As he was returning from this sad duty, he thought of the errand given
him by General Nelson to hunt up the boy whom they saw capture the
colors.Riding up to the regiment, he made inquiry, and to his surprise
and delight found that the hero was Hugh Raymond.asked Fred, when the boy presented
himself."Yes, sir," replied Hugh, respectfully."You are the young officer who
got me released when General Nelson tied me to the cannon.I have never
ceased to feel grateful towards you.""Well, Hugh, General Nelson wants to see you again.""Don't want to tie me up again, does
he?"He saw you capture that flag and he is awful mad; so come
along.""General," said Fred, when he had found Nelson, "here is the brave boy
who captured the colors.""That was a gallant act, my boy," kindly remarked Nelson, "and you
deserve the thanks of your general.""It was nothing, General," replied Hugh."It just made me mad to have
them shake their dirty rag in my face, and I resolved to have it."He noticed Hugh more closely, and
then suddenly asked: "Have I not seen you somewhere before, my boy?""Yes, General," replied Hugh, trembling."On the march here, when you tied me by the wrists to a cannon for
straggling."Nelson was slightly taken back by the answer; then an amused look came
into his face, and he said, in a bantering tone: "Liked it, didn't you?""I was just
mad enough at you to kill you.""There is the boy for me," said Nelson, turning to his staff."He not
only captures flags, but he tells his general to his face what he thinks
of him."Then addressing Hugh, he continued: "I want a good orderly, and
I will detail you for the position."So Hugh Raymond became an orderly to General Nelson, and learned to love
him as much as he once hated him.Now occurred one of those strange psychological impressions which
science has never yet explained.A feeling came to Fred that he must
ride over the battlefield.It was as if some unseen hand was pulling
him, some power exerted that he could not resist.He mounted his horse
and rode away, the course he took leading him to the place where
Trabue's Kentucky brigade made its last desperate stand.Suddenly the prostrate figure of a Confederate officer, apparently dead,
attracted Fred's attention.As he looked a great fear clutched at his
heart, causing it to stand still.Springing from his horse, he bent over
the death-like form; then with a cry of anguish sank on his knees beside
it.He had looked into the face of his father.[Illustration: Springing from his Horse, he bent over the death-like
form.]Bending down, he placed his ear over his father's heart; a faint
fluttering could be heard.A ball had shattered Colonel
Shackelford's leg, and he was bleeding to death.For Fred to cut away the clothing from around the wound, and then to
take a handkerchief and tightly twist it around the limb above the wound
was the work of a moment.Tenderly was
Colonel Shackelford carried back, his weeping son walking by his side.The surgeon carefully examined the wounded limb, and then brusquely
said: "It will have to come off.""It's that, or his life," shortly answered the surgeon."Do it then," hoarsely replied Fred, as he turned away unable to bear
the cruel sight.When Colonel Shackelford came to himself, he was lying in a state-room
in a steamboat, and was rapidly gliding down the Tennessee.Fred was
sitting by his side, watching every movement, for his father had been
hovering between life and death.Colonel Shackelford faintly asked."Dear father," whispered Fred, "you have been very sick.Don't talk,"
and he gave him a soothing potion.The colonel took it without a word, and sank into a quiet slumber.The
surgeon came in, and looking at him, said: "It is all right, captain; he
has passed the worst, and careful nursing will bring him around."When the surgeon was gone Fred fell on his knees and poured out his soul
in gratitude that his father was to live.When Colonel Shackelford became strong enough to hear the story, Fred
told him all; how he found him on the battlefield nearly dead from the
loss of blood; how he bound up his wound and saved his life."And now, father," he said, "I am taking you home--home where we can be
happy once more."The wounded man closed his eyes and did not speak.Fred sank on his
knees beside him."Father," he moaned, "father, can you not forgive?Can you not take me
to your heart and love me once more?"The father trembled; then stretching forth his feeble arm, he gently
placed his hand on the head of his boy and murmured, "My son!In the old Kentucky home
Fred nursed his father back to health and strength.But another sad duty remained for Fred to perform.As soon as he felt
that he could safely leave his father, he went to Louisville and placed
in Mabel Vaughn's hands the little flag, torn by the cruel bullet and
crimsoned with the heart's blood of her lover.The color fled from her
face, she tottered, and Fred thought she was going to faint, but she
recovered herself quickly, and leading him to a seat said gently: "Now
tell me all about it."Fred told her of the dreadful charge; how Marsden, in the very front,
among the bravest of the brave, had found a soldier's death; and when he
had finished the girl raised her streaming eyes to heaven and thanked
God that he had given her such a lover.Then standing before Fred, her beautiful face rendered still more
beautiful by her sorrow, she said:

"Robert is gone, but I still have a work to do.Hereafter I shall do
what I can to alleviate the sufferings of those who uphold the country's
flag.In memory of this," and she pressed the little blood-stained flag
to her lips, "I devote my life to this sacred object."And binding up her broken heart, she went forth on her mission of love.She cooled the fevered brow, she bound up the broken limb, she whispered
words of consolation into the ear of the dying, and wiped the death damp
from the marble brow.Her very presence was a benediction, and those
whose minds wandered would whisper as she passed that they had seen an
angel.Calhoun Pennington bitterly mourned the death of his chief.He afterward
joined his fortune with John H. Morgan, and became one of that famous
raider's most daring and trusted officers.For some weeks Fred remained at home, happy in the company and love of
his father.But their peace was rudely disturbed by the raids of Morgan,
and then by the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederate armies.After the untimely death of Nelson, Fred became attached to the staff of
General George H. Thomas, and greatly distinguished himself in the
numerous campaigns participated in by that famous general.But he never
performed more valiant service than when he was known as "General
Nelson's Scout."There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice
[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,
who dined with me.We had now rain after such a drought as no man in
England had known.We had not had above one or two
considerable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months.Many
trees died for the want of refreshment.Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.The King being returned from Winchester, there was
a numerous Court at Whitehall.At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the
Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner
of the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin.These alterations being very
unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,
to his Majesty.I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the
rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought
into England.She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold
(as I remember) for above L2,000.At the same time, I went to see a
crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the
Egyptian crocodile.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of
Northumberland.He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well
bred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his
campaign at the siege of Luxemburg.Of all his Majesty's children (of
which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth
the owning.What the
Dukes of Richmond and St.Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet
discover; they are very pretty boys.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1684.Goodman preached before the King on James ii.12, concerning the law of liberty: an excellent discourse and in good
method.He is author of "The Prodigal Son," a treatise worth reading,
and another of the old religion.I visited the Lord Chamberlain, where dined the
BLACK BARON and Monsieur Flamerin, who had so long been banished from
France for a duel.I carried Lord Clarendon through the city amid all
the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal
Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner.Clement's, that prettily built and contrived church where
a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on 1 Cor.20, inciting to
gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the
dignity of our nature.A sudden change from temperate warm weather to an
excessive cold rain, frost, snow, and storm, such as had seldom been
known.This winter weather began as early and fierce as the past did
late; till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely
upon the death of Dr.Peter Gunning, preached before the King at
Whitehall on Romans iii.8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the
Church of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome.He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our
Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and
rebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my
certain observation a great truth.Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks
on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and
other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and
mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here.But
the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very
water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and
then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with
grenades and innumerable other devices.It is said it cost L1,500.It
was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants
danced in the great hall.The court had not been seen so brave and rich
in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.Fiennes, son of the Lord Say
and Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi.Slingsby (Master of the
Mint), to see Mr.The series of Popes
was rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John
Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars some
Greek, etc., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a
medallion of Otho Paulus Aemilius, etc., ancient.They were held at a
price of L1,000; but not worth, I judge, above L200.I went to see the new church at St.James's,
elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble
inclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about
the walls by Mr.Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her
breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border
environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered,
and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was
said) of L200.There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there
been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.James's Park
to see three Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now first
shown to his Majesty.There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg.They were taken from a Bashaw at
the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer.I never
beheld so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat a bright
bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast,
belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful,
and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt,
turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable.With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what
I remember Busbequius, speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in
Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them
retain their ill habits.They trotted like does, as if they did not feel
the ground.Five hundred guineas was demanded for the first; 300 for the
second; and 200 for the third, which was brown.All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect as the
first.It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of
Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled
in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of
the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never
seen any horses in these parts to be compared with them.Add to all
this, the furniture consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings,
quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, _a la
Turcisq_; the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine
I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of
silver, curiously wrought and double gilt to an incredible value.Such
and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it.The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered
with chains of silver gilt.There was also a Turkish royal standard of a
horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a
general's horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be
seen more glorious.The gentleman (a German) who rode the horse, was in
all this garb.They were shod with iron made round and closed at the
heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling.I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young
gallants do their exercise.Faubert having newly railed in a manage,
and fitted it for the academy.There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham.The exercises were, 1, running at the ring; 2, flinging a
javelin at a Moor's head; 3, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly
taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in
full speed.The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in
every one, a dozen times, as I think.The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding
bravely.Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous.Here I
saw the difference of what the French call "_bel homme a cheval_," and
"_bon homme a cheval_"; the Duke of Norfolk being the first, that is
rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both
in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider.But the
Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these twelve
years before.There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the
Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of
the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.John, a worthy gentleman, on a knight
of quality, in a tavern.So
many horrid murders and duels were committed about this time as were
never before heard of in England; which gave much cause of complaint and
murmurings.It proved so sharp weather, and so long and cruel
a frost, that the Thames was frozen across, but the frost was often
dissolved, and then froze again.5, after
the Presbyterian tedious method and repetition.I dined at Lord Newport's, who had some excellent
pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the
best he ever painted; another of our English Dobson's painting; but,
above all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable piece;
with something of most other famous hands.I saw this
evening such a scene of profuse gaming, and the King in the midst of his
three concubines, as I have never before seen--luxurious dallying and
profaneness.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being invited to hear
that celebrated voice of Mr.Pordage, newly come from Rome; his singing
was after the Venetian recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an
excellent voice both treble and bass; Dr.Walgrave accompanied it with
his THEORBO LUTE, on which he performed beyond imagination, and is
doubtless one of the greatest masters in Europe on that charming
instrument.Pordage is a priest, as Mr.There was in the room where we dined, and in his bedchamber, those
incomparable pieces of Columbus, a Flagellation, the Grammar school, the
Venus and Adonis of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late
Earl of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and Earl of
Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of incomparable performance;
besides that of Moses and the burning bush of Bassano, and several other
pieces of the best masters.A marble head of M. Brutus, etc.I was invited to my Lord Arundel's, of Wardour (now
newly released of his six years' confinement in the Tower on suspicion
of the plot called Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr.Pordage entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the harpsichord.My
daughter Mary being with us, she also sang to the great satisfaction of
both the masters, and a world of people of quality present.She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we
had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a
delicate voice, and had been well taught.Packer
(daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was
so loud as took away much of the sweetness.Certainly never woman had a
stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it.She would
do rarely in a large church among the nuns.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th February, 1685.I went to London, hearing his Majesty had been the
Monday before (2d February) surprised in his bedchamber with an
apoplectic fit, so that if, by God's providence, Dr.King (that
excellent chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment; which might have been of direful
consequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this
Doctor and one more, as I am assured.It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him
bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.This rescued his Majesty
for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve.He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,
till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and
both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that day about
noon, the physicians thought him feverish.This they seemed glad of, as
being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former
fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a
fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp
operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder
might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made
him very weak.Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when
complaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood
from him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him
relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and
struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after
eleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th
year of his reign, and 54th of his age.Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the
Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half
quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he
expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices.Those
who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr.Ken, the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the
receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of
it, which he did so long till it was too late.Others whispered that the
Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to
administer the Popish offices.He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke
who was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears.He
also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the
Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure.He entreated
the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had
sent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if
at any time she had offended him.He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the
Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might
not starve.[Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and
    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,
    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do
    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common
    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where
    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,
    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,
    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him
    if he was sorry for his sins?which the King saying he was, the
    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased
    to receive the Sacrament?to which the King made no reply; and being
    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that
    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and
    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and
    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little
    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a
    priest, to which the King replied: "For God's sake, brother, do, and
    lose no time."The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none
    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant
    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back
    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the
    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the
    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the
    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being
    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the
    Sacrament.--"Life of James II."]Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and
in all appearance promising a long life.He was a prince of many
virtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not
bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in
shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew
of many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he
loved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,
which passed to luxury and intolerable expense.He had a particular
talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had
innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too
presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused.He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his
bedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,
which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty
and stinking.He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he
been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to
supply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent
persons who had signally served both him and his father.He frequently
and easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not
here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious
opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,
and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature
resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane
wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he
had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much
experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures
took him from off all application becoming so great a King.The history
of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical
death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous
restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,
fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand
other particulars.He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all
occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his
loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately
to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately
declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession
had fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however
he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should
find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as
great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its
principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing
themselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never
depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life
in defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in
all its lawful rights and liberties.[Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words
    employed) of what is stated by King James II.printed in
    his life; but in that MS.For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England
    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, "AND THEREFORE I SHALL
    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT."James then goes on to
    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,
    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr.Finch (then
    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that
    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,
    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty
    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing
    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to
    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published.The
    King afterward proceeds to say: "No one can wonder that Mr.Finch
    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the
    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass
    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to
    promise both security to their religion and protection to their
    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by
    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established
    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he
    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the
    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience
    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his
    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or
    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,
    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they
    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a
    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of
    expressing it which Mr.Finch had made choice of, he thought it
    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he
    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in
    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended
    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further
    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath
    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained
    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in
    England."The words printed in small
    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King
    James II.]This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be
published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous
people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to.Then were the
Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all
officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no
failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known.Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where,
while he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber to take order for
the PROCLAIMING his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented
should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after
the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc., should
proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it.Upon this was I, and several other gentlemen waiting in the Privy
gallery, admitted into the Council chamber to be witness of what was
resolved on.Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other
Crown officers being ready, we first went to Whitehall gate, where the
Lords stood on foot bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his
Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the
form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first sounded three times,
which ended with the people's acclamations.Then a herald called the
Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor
and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and
proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we
returned in the order we set forth.Being come to Whitehall, we all went
and kissed the King and Queen's hands.He had been on the bed, but was
now risen and in his undress.The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but
put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was,
having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came
into England, which made her universally beloved.I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and
all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being
Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King
sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and
Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love songs[57] in that glorious
gallery, while about twenty of the great courtiers and other dissolute
persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made
reflections with astonishment.Six days after, was all in the dust.[Footnote 57: _Ante_, p.It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a
father, in the most solemn manner.Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to
appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to
Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop,
with an appearance, I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant with other
officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town,
marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market place, where, making a
ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read
the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and
then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk
in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers,
and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in
Staffordshire, being about L20 per annum, which lying so great a
distance, I thought fit to part with it to one Burton, a farmer there.It came to me as part of my daughter-in-law's portion, this being but a
fourth part of what was divided between the mother and three sisters.The King was this night very obscurely buried in a
vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of
pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the
whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral
behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery.All
the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form.The second
sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of
his subjects, did now, for the first time, go to mass publicly in the
little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open.I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, auditor of the
exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences,
for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir
Positive; not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting.He was son to the
late Earl of Berkshire.This morning his Majesty restored the staff and key
to Lord Arlington, Chamberlain; to Mr.Savell, Vice-chamberlain; to
Lords Newport and Maynard, Treasurer and Comptroller of the household.Lord Godolphin made Chamberlain to the Queen; Lord Peterborough groom of
the stole, in place of the Earl of Bath; the Treasurer's staff to the
Earl of Rochester; and his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord Privy
Seal, in the place of the Marquis of Halifax, who was made President of
the Council; the Secretaries of State remaining as before.The Lord Treasurer and the other new officers were
sworn at the Chancery Bar and the exchequer.The late King having the revenue of excise, customs, and other late
duties granted for his life only, they were now farmed and let to
several persons, upon an opinion that the late King might let them for
three years after his decease; some of the old commissioners refused to
act.The lease was made but the day before the King died;[58] the major
part of the Judges (but, as some think, not the best lawyers),
pronounced it legal, but four dissented.[Footnote 58: James, in his Life, makes no mention of this lease,
    but only says HE continued to collect them, which conduct was not
    blamed; but, on the contrary, he was thanked for it, in an address
    from the Middle Temple, penned by Sir Bartholomew Shore, and
    presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, carrying great authority with
    it; nor did the Parliament find fault.]The clerk of the closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next
the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and
that prayers should be said as formerly.Several most useful tracts against Dissenters,
<DW7>s and Fanatics, and resolutions of cases were now published by the
London divines.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th March, 1685.To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish
Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said,
and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had
ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew
jealous as to what this would tend.A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain
elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the
corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what
returns of members they pleased.There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of
the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of
mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and
tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn.The Queen-Consort sat under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain
the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.Lent preachers continued as formerly in the Royal
Chapel.My daughter, Mary, was taken with smallpox, and there
soon was found no hope of her recovery.A great affliction to me: but
God's holy will be done!She received the blessed sacrament; after which,
disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she
bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and
piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind.She
died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to
our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best
quality, greatest and most virtuous persons.The justness of her
stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion,
unaffected, though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the least of her
ornaments compared with those of her mind.Of early piety, singularly
religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading,
and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of
common-place, as out of Dr.Hammond on the New Testament, and most of
the best practical treatises.She had read and digested a considerable
deal of history, and of places.The French tongue was as familiar to her
as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable
account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful
memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet
reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which
she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best
quality, she thereby improved.She had an excellent voice, to which she
played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to
that perfection, that of the scholars of those two famous masters,
Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the
sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness
to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she
sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note,
because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord
Arundel's, at Wardour.What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and
agreeableness of her humor?condescending to the meanest servant in the
family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride.She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody.Piety
was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that
even among equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately
acquainted, but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of
devotion; she had one or two confidants with whom she used to pass whole
days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly
communion, and other solemn occasions.She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and
ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play,
but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them,
and the time spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity.She never
played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but
this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she
could name a fault.No one could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as
she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that
maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of
expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have
astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written.She had
a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be
decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master
say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save
in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described.Nothing affected, but natural and
easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always
material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her
tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming.Nothing was so
pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would
caress and humor with great delight.But she most affected to be with
grave and sober men, of whom she might learn something, and improve
herself.I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me;
comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some
excess, had I not sometimes repressed it.Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would
willingly have spent whole days, for as I said she had read abundance of
history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems; she could compose
happily and put in pretty symbols, as in the "_Mundus Muliebris_,"
wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and
ornaments belonging to the sex.But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most
dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with
great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well
pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant
course of piety.Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part
with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and
reluctancy of a tender parent!Thy affection, duty and love to me was
that of a friend as well as a child.Nor less dear to thy mother, whose
example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to
her less conspicuous.To the grave shall we both carry thy memory!God alone (in
whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!)give us to resign thee and all
our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed
pleasure!Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to
bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious
and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening
through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with
thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee,
glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity!It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness happened to her.An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it
in particular, which struck her but two days before she came home, by an
imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who,
after they had been a good while in the house, told them she has a
servant sick of the smallpox (who indeed died the next day): this my
poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits.There were
four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and
I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion.She showed
great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never
would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God,
above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the
vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and
but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient
for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you
design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family.This
was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed
from an extraordinary child, and one who loved her parents beyond
example.At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being
there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our
neighbor (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an
affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the
city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her
accompany my Lady, and staying some time with her; it was with the
greatest reluctance I complied.While she was there, my Lord being
musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I
was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of
Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching.It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the
Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the
vain and empty conversation of the town, the theaters, the court, and
trifling visits which consumed so much precious time, and made her
sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the
greatest satisfaction.She was weary of this life, and I think went not
thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her.She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed
one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, one of the Queen's women of
the bedchamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of
that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there
was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a
maid of honor to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy.But this she
did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much as the
service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve
herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was
arrived at so great a measure.This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child,
whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more
durable than brass and marble.Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I
ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things
worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me.Never
can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to
me!This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in
which I first drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there
in the great sickness that year upon the first of that month, and the
very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

16th March, 1685.She was interred in the southeast end of the church at
Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and
relations.My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my
own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life,
but some circumstances did not permit it.Holden,
preached her funeral sermon on Phil."For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse,
as those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not to be
present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and
signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers.I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be
spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people.Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person, others
sending their coaches, of which there were six or seven with six horses,
viz, the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir
Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others.There
were distributed among her friends about sixty rings.Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her
sex and of my poor family!God Almighty of his infinite mercy grant me
the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health and comfort to
my family: "teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to
wisdom," be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit!On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of
collections she had made from historians, poets, travelers, etc., but,
above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these
contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically
disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions,
with many pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not named)
to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not
despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but
beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults,
imploring his assistance and spiritual directions.I well remember she
had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not
think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing
the great innocency and integrity of her life.It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial and
practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially
music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving
visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she
has left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume a
world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet
abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation.But she was a little
miracle while she lived, and so she died!I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that
excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the
Dutch war.He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier
of Calais.This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now
King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when
she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident
he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the
vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason
satisfaction.He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we
have few such seamen left.Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction,
I went to London to hear Dr.Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent)
at Whitehall.I observed that though the King was not in his seat above
in the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which they were not
used to do when the late King was absent, making then one bowing only.I
asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do.The
Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair,
as if he had been present.I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall to dwell at
Somerset House.This day my brother of Wotton and Mr.Onslow were candidates for Surrey
against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were
circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking
advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of
Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being
tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they
expecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured.The Duke of Norfolk led
Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party.For this Parliament,
very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks,
and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the
country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it
by the trick above mentioned.Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could
not hear one word.Sir Edward Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in
favor with his Majesty.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1685.I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr.Tillotson, Dean
of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles.I returned in the evening,
and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among the plotters for
poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and
surely I believed him guiltless.According to my custom, I went to London to pass the
holy week.Tenison preached at the new church at
St.22, upon the infinite love of God to us, which
he illustrated in many instances.The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated.Sprat,
Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very
full of Lords, the two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament.I supped with
the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home.Was the coronation of the King and Queen.The solemnity
was magnificent as is set forth in print.The Bishop of Ely preached;
but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.However, the King begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of
much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and
country.Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn,
Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies.I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such
a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the <DW7>s, and
alarmed several Parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers
priests, noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's bench; but,
being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see the issue, considering
that it would be published.Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the
hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person
who had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily believe, had done
much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and
ill-grounded proceedings; while he was at first so unreasonably blown up
and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable.Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of
excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing first against the
Dissenters in several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and
Trimmers, under the title of "Observator," which came out three or four
days every week, in which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of
England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several
passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially
now that nobody gave the least occasion.[59]

    [Footnote 59: In the first Dutch war, while Evelyn was one of the
    Commissioners for sick and wounded, L'Estrange in his "Gazette"
    mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war:
    whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the
    Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would
    visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required
    L'Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.]The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly to have been
the first Parliament called by his Majesty, gave the excise and customs
to him and his successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making
eloquent speeches, and especially minding them of a speedy suppression
of those late desperate Field-Conventiclers who had done such unheard of
assassinations.In the meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in
England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places.God grant a better issue of it than some expect!Oates was sentenced to be whipped and pilloried with the
utmost severity.I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William
Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the "MONASTICON" and other
learned works; he told me he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and
memory perfect.There was shown a draft of the exact shape and
dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned withal, together with
the jewels and pearls, their weight and value, which amounted to
L100,658 sterling, attested at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and
goldsmith who set them.In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my
Lord Privy Seal to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his
Lordship next the bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both
for hearing and seeing.After a short space, came in the Queen and
Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the archbishops, at the side
of the House on the right hand of the throne.In the interim, divers of
the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths,
so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind
the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.,
renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed,
standing all the while.Then came in the King, the crown on his head,
and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full,
he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly
enough, to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament from the
moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the
concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and
his subjects; that he would confirm whatever he had said in his
declaration at the first Council concerning his opinion of the
principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend
and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established;
that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart
from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense of
the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this
assurance of his care of our religion (his word was YOUR religion) and
property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted
not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially
as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of
government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might
possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to
time only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments; but that
that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best
way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and
therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being
but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts.Then he acquainted
them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West
Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he
had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should
take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved,
not questioning the Parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he
desired; at which there followed another "_Vive le Roi_," and so his
Majesty retired.So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand
committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the
revenue to his Majesty for life.Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were
obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being
legally returned; but no one seconded him.The truth is, there were many
of the new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in
the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon,
Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and
from the effect of the new charters changing the electors.It was
reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer
than fifteen charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector:
whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested,
they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that
though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people
before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.By the printed list of
members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135 who had been in
former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford.In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against two or three
young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only four or five days, of
being of age.The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their
confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of
which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy.Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at several places and
whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed
on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some
thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the
perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved.I chanced to pass just as execution
was doing on him.Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his
Majesty, as usual.It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many
believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in
Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair
for that office.I gave him joy the morning before of his new honor, he
having always been very civil to me.We had hitherto not any rain for many months, so as the
caterpillars had already devoured all the winter fruit through the whole
land, and even killed several greater old trees.Such two winters and
summers I had never known.Came to visit and take leave of me Sir Gabriel Sylvius,
now going Envoy-extraordinary into Denmark, with his secretary and
chaplain, a Frenchman, who related the miserable persecution of the
Protestants in France; not above ten churches left them, and those also
threatened to be demolished; they were commanded to christen their
children within twenty-four hours after birth, or else a Popish priest
was to be called, and then the infant brought up in Popery.In some
places, they were thirty leagues from any minister, or opportunity of
worship.This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of
the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations.There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord
Godolphin's little son, my charge.I brought them to the water side
where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London.There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of
Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his
standard as King of England.I pray God deliver us from the confusion
which these beginnings threaten!Such a dearth for want of rain was never in my memory.The Duke landed with but 150 men; but the whole kingdom
was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the
trained bands flocking to him.At his landing, he published a
Declaration, charging his Majesty with usurpation and several horrid
crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering to call a free
Parliament.This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the
Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of L5,000 to any who should kill
him.At this time, the words engraved on the monument in London, intimating
that the <DW7>s fired the city, were erased and cut out.I received a warrant to send out a horse with twelve
days' provisions, etc.We had now plentiful rain after two years' excessive
drought and severe winters.Argyle taken in Scotland, and executed, and his party dispersed.No considerable account of the troops sent against the
Duke, though great forces sent.There was a smart skirmish; but he would
not be provoked to come to an encounter, but still kept in the
fastnesses.Dangerfield whipped, like Oates, for perjury.Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat, and the next day
of his being taken by Sir William Portman and Lord Lumley with the
militia of their counties.It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey,
being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short
a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as
when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him
a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse,
breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey,
leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of 2,000.The
whole number reported to be above 8,000; the King's but 2,700.The slain
were most of them MENDIP-MINERS, who did great execution with their
tools, and sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying were
pursued and taken the next morning, not far from one another.Monmouth
had gone sixteen miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and
was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but
without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some
countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be
known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak.Grey was
taken not far from him.Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor
cloth workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to
him.The arch-_boutefeu_, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet found.The L5,000 to be given to whoever should bring Monmouth in, was to be
distributed among the militia by agreement between Sir William Portman
and Lord Lumley.The battle ended, some words, first in jest, then in
passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to
Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and one
Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one another.Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of
those who knew him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th July, 1685.Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a
little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near his
Majesty's bedchamber door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a
rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a
time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at first took little
notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he
reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said
yes, he meant his Lordship.My Lord told him he was no excluder (as
indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he
lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord
returned, and felled him.They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to
be carried to the Greencloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as
he deserved.I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr.Elias Ashmole's,
with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St.Tenison, when
we were treated at a great feast.The Count of Castel Mellor, that great favorite and
prime minister of Alphonso, late King of Portugal, after several years'
banishment, being now received to grace and called home by Don Pedro,
the present King, as having been found a person of the greatest
integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to spend part of this day
with him, and assist him in a collection of books and other curiosities,
which he would carry with him into Portugal.Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my late dear child, but
whom she could not bring herself to answer in affection, died now of the
same cruel disease, for which I was extremely sorry, because he never
enjoyed himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I averse to the
match, could she have overcome her disinclination.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th July, 1685.Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King,
to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by
Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain.He was sent to the
Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly,
having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two
years.He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his
last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to
administer the Holy Communion to him.For the rest of his faults he
professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear.He would
not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the
fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave
him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off;
which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away,
they would have torn him to pieces.The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower Hill), but
gave a paper containing not above five or six lines, for the King, in
which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late
King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so
desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children.Martin's), who, with the Bishops of
Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies,
being extremely handsome and adroit, an excellent soldier and dancer, a
favorite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by
crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and
taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a
party of discontented men.He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought
him great riches, and a second dukedom in Scotland.He was Master of the
Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end.See what ambition and want of principles
brought him to!He was beheaded on Tuesday, 14th of July.His mother,
whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a
beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably
without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe
that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery!And
to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one Sidney who was
familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be
so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy
Councillors' attestation.[60]

    [Footnote 60: The "Life of James II."contains an account of the
    circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in
    illustration of the statements of the text.Ross, tutor to the Duke
    of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign
    a certificate of the King's marriage to Mrs.Barlow, though her own
    name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused.She was born of a
    gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace,
    came to London to make her fortune.Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel
    in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her fifty broad pieces (as he
    told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his
    regiment, he missed his bargain.She went into Holland, where she
    fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept
    her for some time, till the King hearing of her, got her from him.On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is
    already sped; and, after being with the King, she was so soon with
    child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and
    the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the
    Colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face.In the King's absence she behaved
    so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would
    have no further commerce with her, and she became a common
    prostitute at Paris.]Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there
would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would
have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity.For my
own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal.Such an
inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have
caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and
confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end.Blessed be
God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity
for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!I went to see the muster of the six Scotch and English
regiments whom the Prince of Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out
of Holland upon this rebellion, but which were now returning, there
having been no occasion for their use.They were all excellently clad
and well disciplined, and were encamped on Blackheath with their tents:
the King and Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner of their
encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had
been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary
to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it,
it was prevented.The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into the county troops,
were now come home, after a month's being out to our great charge.The Trinity Company met this day, which should have
been on the Monday after Trinity, but was put off by reason of the Royal
Charter being so large, that it could not be ready before.Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, was a
second time chosen Master.There were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Dartmouth, Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy, and
Brethren of the Corporation.We went to church, according to custom, and
then took barge to the Trinity House, in London, where we had a great
dinner, above eighty at one table.[Sidenote: CHELSEA]

7th August, 1685.Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries'
garden of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree
bearing Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in quartan agues.What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove
under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors
and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.Boscawen, with my Lord
Godolphin's little son, with whose education hitherto his father had
intrusted me.My daughter Elizabeth died of the smallpox, soon
after having married a young man, nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor
of the Navy, and one of the Commissioners.The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford.Thus, in less than six months were we deprived
of two children for our unworthiness and causes best known to God, whom
I beseech from the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to make
that right use of all these chastisements, that we may become better,
and entirely submit in all things to his infinitely wise disposal.Lord Clarendon (Lord Privy Seal) wrote to let me
know that the King being pleased to send him Lord-Lieutenant into
Ireland, was also pleased to nominate me one of the Commissioners to
execute the office of Privy Seal during his Lieutenancy there, it
behoving me to wait upon his Majesty to give him thanks for this great
honor.I accompanied his Lordship to Windsor (dining by
the way of Sir Henry Capel's at Kew), where his Majesty receiving me
with extraordinary kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible
I was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would endeavor to
serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my
duty than inclination.He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had
the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me.After this, came
abundance of great men to give me joy.I went to prayer in the chapel, and heard
Dr.11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of our
own business, according to the advice of the apostle.Then I went to
hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St.Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew
to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art
and invention, deserve the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor
Verrio.receiving the Black Prince, coming
toward him in a Roman triumph.The throne, the carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think
equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen
abroad.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir William Soames,
designed Ambassador to Constantinople.About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and
brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at
his house in Oxfordshire.The King went immediately to council;
everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice
Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now
gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in
several counties, and was now near upon his return.I took my leave of
his Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping that night at
Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.Pepys to Portsmouth, whither his
Majesty was going the first time since his coming to the Crown, to see
in what state the fortifications were.We took coach and six horses,
late after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night.While supper was
making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs.Graham, some time maid of
honor to the Queen Dowager, now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy
purse to the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a little
quarter of a mile from Bagshot town.Very importunate she was that I
would sup, and abide there that night; but, being obliged by my
companion, I returned to our inn, after she had shown me her house,
which was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an excellent
housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady.There is a park full of red deer
about it.Her eldest son was now sick there of the smallpox, but in a
likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might
while young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one
time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this
cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she
affirmed.[Sidenote: WINCHESTER]

16th September, 1685.The next morning, setting out early, we arrived
soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the
Dean's (Dr.I found very few with him besides my Lords
Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells.His Majesty
was discoursing with the bishops concerning miracles, and what strange
things the Saludadors[61] would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their
mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which
his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of
miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to
see one himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a
delusion of his senses.Then they spoke of the boy who was pretended to
have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr.To all of which the Bishop added a great miracle
happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor, miserably
sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized) who
immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of
King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing one that was
blind.[Footnote 61: Evelyn subjoins this note:--"As to that of the
    Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly
    as Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr.Pepys
    passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth
    of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous
    one at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would
    make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before
    him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more
    than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so
    acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that
    what they pretended was all a cheat, which he would easily discover,
    though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet
    have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their
    jugglings.Pepys affirmed to me; but said he, I did not
    conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what
    they pretended to do.There was something said of the second sight happening to some persons,
especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told
us that Monsieur... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly
cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, "_Voila Monsieur comme il
entre sans tete!_" Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had
effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Savior's
cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching.And
speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St.Edward the Confessor at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as
the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a
hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it
to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in
mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during
his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket."I had thought," said
the King, "it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet
that his Majesty would have me secure"; but, says he, "you will remember
that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was
pleased to put it into my hand.It was of gold, about three inches long,
having on one side a crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty broad table
amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within
was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a
Latin inscription in gold and Roman letters.More company coming in,
this discourse ended.I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty
made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at
Windsor or Whitehall, that the <DW64>s in the plantations should all be
baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters
prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be _ipso
facto_ free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them
christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for.I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought
almost to the covering.It is placed on the side of the hill, where
formerly stood the old castle.It is a stately fabric, of three sides
and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone.It was intended for a
hunting-house when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an
incomparable prospect.I believe there had already been L20,000 and more
expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it
at least for a while.Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair.There
are still the coffins of the six Saxon Kings, whose bones had been
scattered by the sacrilegious rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose,
of finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up again and put
into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir.[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

17th September, 1685.Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth,
something before his Majesty arrived.We found all the road full of
people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King
pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way.The
Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were
standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town,
where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort
were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come
into Portsmouth.All the soldiers (near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining
the streets and platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's
residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and
shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir...
Slingsby, the Lieutenant Governor, all the gentlemen in his train
sitting down at table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to
dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous
and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on
his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the house where he dined, and then
having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for
Winchester, whither he returned that night.This hall is artificially
hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor.Hence, to see the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay.There
were now thirty-two men-of-war in the harbor.I was invited by Sir R.
Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr.Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where
we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London.I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, etc., many
years since.I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially
about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a
very fierce commander in the first Rebellion.His house is large, and
standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth.By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in
his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as
to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be
nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of
the national religion.Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of
Ireland was sealed this day.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1685.Pepys with this
expression at the foot of it, "I have something to show you that I may
not have another time," and that I would not fail to dine with him.Houblon (a rich and
considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the
persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that
being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all
along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, etc.,
till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his
inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing
his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself.There
are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives
dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not
so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make
use of it.INDEED, he said, as to SOME MATRIMONIAL CASES, THERE ARE NOW
AND THEN DISPENSATIONS, but hardly in any cases else.Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if
he might ask it without offense, and for that his Majesty could not but
observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had
been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his
Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which
did not befit him to look into.The King ingenuously told him that he
both was and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long since
declared that it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to
himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that
persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a
cabinet, he showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several
arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging
her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the
chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the
primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was
that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely
our Savior would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to
resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned
as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put
together by the late King yet written all with his own hand, blotted and
interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they
might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to
time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking
on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be
without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe.When his Majesty
had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of
these two papers, attested at the bottom in four or five lines under his
own hand.This nice and curious passage I
thought fit to set down.Though all the arguments and objections were
altogether weak, and have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if
nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that,
no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St.Peter's
successors' unerring dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it.Here
all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference
implied.I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was
to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indifference, neglect,
and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects
only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great
advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and
great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane.God
was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and unprosperous, by
wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the
public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious
Court had brought into credit.I think of it with sorrow and pity, when
I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what
opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to that Church for
which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful
to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a
religion; had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he should have
done, not only for the good of his kingdom, but of all the Reformed
Churches in christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our
remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and
destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of.The consequence of
this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further.The
emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till
they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be
able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but
lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments,
antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God,
for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the
profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most
confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be
extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of
the world.I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion,
which I forbear to mention here.In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr.Pepys, and
those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and
ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment
upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he makes a conscience
of what he promises, to perform it.In this confidence, I hope that the
Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands)
to flourish also.In all events, whatever does become of the Church of
England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth,
the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.I had my picture drawn this week by the famous
Kneller.[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th October, 1685.I went to London about finishing my lodgings at
Whitehall.Being the King's birthday, there was a solemn ball
at Court, and before it music of instruments and voices.I happened by
accident to stand the very next to the Queen and the King, who talked
with me about the music.The King was now building all that range from east
to west by the court and garden to the street, and making a new chapel
for the Queen, whose lodgings were to be in this new building, as also a
new Council chamber and offices next the south end of the banqueting
house.I returned home, next morning, to London.I accompanied my Lady Clarendon to her house at
Swallowfield, in Berks, dining by the way at Mr.Graham's lodge at
Bagshot; the house, newly repaired and capacious enough for a good
family, stands in a park.Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the ancient
building of honorable gentlemen's houses, when they kept up ancient
hospitality, but the gardens and waters as elegant as it is possible to
make a flat by art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being so
extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord in diligence of
planting; so that I have hardly seen a seat which shows more tokens of
it than what is to be found here, not only in the delicious and rarest
fruits of a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the ground
about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit of the place.There
is one orchard of 1,000 golden, and other cider pippins; walks and
groves of elms, limes, oaks, and other trees.The garden is so beset
with all manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air.The
distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is excellent.The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most desirable plants; two
very noble orangeries well furnished: but, above all, the canal and fish
ponds, the one fed with a white, the other with a black running water,
fed by a quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with
fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw anything
approaching it.We had at every meal carp and pike of a size fit for the
table of a Prince, and what added to the delight was, to see the
hundreds taken by the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we
pointed out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would have been
worth at London twenty shillings a piece.The waters are flagged about
with _Calamus aromaticus_, with which my lady has hung a closet, that
retains the smell very perfectly.There is also a certain sweet willow
and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green, meadow, pasture, and
wood; in a word, all that can render a country seat delightful.There is
besides a well-furnished library in the house.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1685.We returned to London, having been treated with all
sorts of cheer and noble freedom by that most religious and virtuous
lady.She was now preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made
Lord Deputy, and went to this country house and ancient seat of her
father and family, to set things in order during her absence; but never
were good people and neighbors more concerned than all the country (the
poor especially) for the departure of this charitable woman; everyone
was in tears, and she as unwilling to part from them.There was among
them a maiden of primitive life, the daughter of a poor laboring man,
who had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by her labor, and
has for many years refused marriage, or to receive any assistance from
the parish, besides the little hermitage my lady gives her rent-free;
she lives on four pence a day, which she gets by spinning; says she
abounds and can give alms to others, living in great humility and
content, without any apparent affectation, or singularity; she is
continually working, praying, or reading, gives a good account of her
knowledge in religion, visits the sick; is not in the least given to
talk; very modest, of a simple not unseemingly behavior; of a comely
countenance, clad very plain, but clean and tight.In sum, she appears a
saint of an extraordinary sort, in so religious a life, as is seldom met
with in villages now-a-days.I was invited to dine at Sir Stephen Fox's with my
Lord Lieutenant, where was such a dinner for variety of all things as I
had seldom seen, and it was so for the trial of a master-cook whom Sir
Stephen had recommended to go with his Lordship into Ireland; there were
all the dainties not only of the season, but of what art could add,
venison, plain solid meat, fowl, baked and boiled meats, banquet
[dessert], in exceeding plenty, and exquisitely dressed.There also
dined my Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter), my Lady
Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.At the Royal Society, an urn full of bones was
presented, dug up in a highway, while repairing it, in a field in
Camberwell, in Surrey; it was found entire with its cover, among many
others, believed to be truly Roman and ancient.Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a chariot he had
invented, which it was not possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way
it was drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in
that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some
inconveniences yet to be remedied--it would not contain more than one
person; was ready to take fire every ten miles; and being placed and
playing on no fewer than ten rollers, it made a most prodigious noise,
almost intolerable.A remedy was to be sought for these inconveniences.I dined at our great Lord Chancellor Jefferies', who
used me with much respect.This was the late Chief-Justice who had newly
been the Western Circuit to try the Monmouth conspirators, and had
formerly done such severe justice among the obnoxious in Westminster
Hall, for which his Majesty dignified him by creating him first a Baron,
and now Lord Chancellor.He had some years past been conversant in
Deptford; is of an assured and undaunted spirit, and has served the
Court interest on all the hardiest occasions; is of nature cruel, and a
slave of the Court.The French persecution of the Protestants raging
with the utmost barbarity, exceeded even what the very heathens used:
innumerable persons of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their
earthly substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed
through all the countries of Europe.The French tyrant abrogated the
Edict of Nantes which had been made in favor of them, and without any
cause; on a sudden demolishing all their churches, banishing,
imprisoning, and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering
the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of barbarous usage by
soldiers sent to ruin and prey on them; taking away their children;
forcing people to the Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they
burnt their libraries, pillaged their goods, ate up their fields and
substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys, and seized on
their estates.There had now been numbered to pass through Geneva only
(and that by stealth, for all the usual passages were strictly guarded
by sea and land) 40,000 toward Switzerland.In Holland, Denmark, and all
about Germany, were dispersed some hundred thousands; besides those in
England, where, though multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and
welcome as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least
encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen into, and the
uncharitable indifference of such as should have embraced them; and I
prey it be not laid to our charge.The famous Claude fled to Holland;
Allix and several more came to London, and persons of great estates came
over, who had forsaken all.France was almost dispeopled, the bankers so
broken, that the tyrant's revenue was exceedingly diminished,
manufactures ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred
what was done, nor did the <DW7>s themselves approve it.What the
further intention is, time will show; but doubtless portending some
revolution.I was shown the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia on Rhone made in
the name of the Clergy, celebrating the French King, as if he was a God,
for persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in it, "That
as his victory over heresy was greater than all the conquests of
Alexander and Caesar, it was but what was wished in England; and that God
seemed to raise the French King to this power and magnanimous action,
that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same here."This
paragraph is very bold and remarkable; several reflecting on Archbishop
Usher's prophecy as now begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in
all other reformed churches.One thing was much taken notice of, that
the "Gazettes" which were still constantly printed twice a week,
informing us what was done all over Europe, never spoke of this
wonderful proceeding in France; nor was any relation of it published by
any, save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives brought.Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture; but it appeared very
extraordinary in a Protestant country that we should know nothing of
what Protestants suffered, while great collections were made for them in
foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1685.It being an extraordinarily wet morning, and myself
indisposed by a very great rheum, I did not go to church, to my very
great sorrow, it being the first Gunpowder Conspiracy anniversary that
had been kept now these eighty years under a prince of the Roman
religion.Bonfires were forbidden on this day; what does this portend!The King in his speech
required continuance of a standing force instead of a militia, and
indemnity and dispensation to Popish officers from the Test; demands
very unexpected and unpleasing to the Commons.He also required a supply
of revenue, which they granted; but returned no thanks to the King for
his speech, till farther consideration.The Commons postponed finishing the bill for the
Supply, to consider the Test, and Popish officers; this was carried but
by one voice.I dined at Lambeth, my Lord Archbishop carrying me
with him in his barge; there were my Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Bishops
of Ely and St.Sherlock, and other divines; Sir William
Hayward, Sir Paul Rycaut, etc.The Parliament was adjourned to February, several
both of Lords and Commons excepting against some passage of his
Majesty's speech relating to the Test, and continuance of Popish
officers in command.This was a great surprise in a Parliament which
people believed would have complied in all things.Popish pamphlets and pictures sold publicly; no books nor answers to
them appearing till long after.I resigned my trust for composing a difference
between Mr.Hitherto was a very wet, warm season.Lord Sunderland was declared President of the
Council, and yet to hold his Secretary's place.The forces disposed into
several quarters through the kingdom are very insolent, on which are
great complaints.Lord Brandon, tried for the late conspiracy, was condemned and pardoned;
so was Lord Grey, his accuser and witness.Persecution in France raging, the French insolently visit our vessels,
and take away the fugitive Protestants; some escape in barrels.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

10th December, 1685.To Greenwich, being put into the new Commission of
Sewers.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Whitehall, before the Princess of Denmark, who, since his Majesty came
to the Crown, always sat in the King's closet, and had the same bowings
and ceremonies applied to the place where she was, as his Majesty had
when there in person.Slayer showed us an experiment of a wonderful
nature, pouring first a very cold liquor into a glass, and superfusing
on it another, to appearance cold and clear liquor also; it first
produced a white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual
flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little shaken
together, fixed divers suns and stars of real fire, perfectly globular,
on the sides of the glass, and which there stuck like so many
constellations, burning most vehemently, and resembling stars and
heavenly bodies, and that for a long space.It seemed to exhibit a
theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and the fixing or
gathering of the universal light into luminous bodies.This matter, or
phosphorus, was made out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital
flame, or heat in animal bodies.I accompanied my Lord-Lieutenant as far as St.Alban's, there going out of town with him near 200 coaches of all the
great officers and nobility.The next morning taking leave, I returned
to London.I dined at the great entertainment his Majesty gave
the Venetian Ambassadors, Signors Zenno and Justiniani, accompanied with
ten more noble Venetians of their most illustrious families, Cornaro,
Maccenigo, etc., who came to congratulate their Majesties coming to the
Crown.The dinner was most magnificent and plentiful, at four tables,
with music, kettledrums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle at
every health.The banquet [dessert] was twelve vast chargers piled up so
high that those who sat one against another could hardly see each other.Of these sweetmeats, which doubtless were some days piling up in that
exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but leaving them to the
spectators who came out of curiosity to see the dinner, were exceedingly
pleased to see in what a moment of time all that curious work was
demolished, the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared.Thus his
Majesty entertained them three days, which (for the table only) cost him
L600, as the Clerk of the Greencloth (Sir William Boreman) assured me.Dinner ended, I saw their procession, or cavalcade, to Whitehall,
innumerable coaches attending.The two Ambassadors had four coaches of
their own, and fifty footmen (as I remember), besides other equipage as
splendid as the occasion would permit, the Court being still in
mourning.Thence, I went to the audience which they had in the Queen's
presence chamber, the Banqueting House being full of goods and furniture
till the galleries on the garden-side, council chamber, and new chapel,
now in the building, were finished.They went to their audience in those
plain black gowns and caps which they constantly wear in the city of
Venice.I was invited to have accompanied the two Ambassadors in their
coach to supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings, as no
longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I excused myself.My Lord Treasurer made me dine with him, where I
became acquainted with Monsieur Barillon, the French Ambassador, a
learned and crafty advocate.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th December, 1685.Turner, brother to the Bishop of Ely, and
sometime tutor to my son, preached at Whitehall on Mark viii.38,
concerning the submission of Christians to their persecutors, in which
were some passages indiscreet enough, considering the time, and the rage
of the inhuman French tyrant against the poor Protestants.Our patent for executing the office of Privy Seal
during the absence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, being this day
sealed by the Lord Chancellor, we went afterward to St.James, where the
Court then was on occasion of building at Whitehall; his Majesty
delivered the seal to my Lord Tiviot and myself, the other Commissioners
not being come, and then gave us his hand to kiss.There were the two
Venetian Ambassadors and a world of company; among the rest the first
Popish Nuncio that had been in England since the Reformation; so
wonderfully were things changed, to the universal jealousy.We were all three Commissioners sworn on our knees
by the Clerk of the Crown, before my Lord Chancellor, three several
oaths: allegiance, supremacy, and the oath belonging to the Lord Privy
Seal, which last we took standing.After this, the Lord Chancellor
invited us all to dinner, but it being Christmas eve we desired to be
excused, intending at three in the afternoon to seal divers things which
lay ready at the office; so attended by three of the Clerks of the
Signet, we met and sealed.Among other things was a pardon to West, who
being privy to the late conspiracy, had revealed the accomplices to save
his own neck.There were also another pardon and two indenizations; and
so agreeing to a fortnight's vacation, I returned home.Recollecting the passages of the year past, and
having made up accounts, humbly besought Almighty God to pardon those my
sins which had provoked him to discompose my sorrowful family; that he
would accept of our humiliation, and in his good time restore comfort to
it.I also blessed God for all his undeserved mercies and preservations,
begging the continuance of his grace and preservation.The winter had
hitherto been extraordinarily wet and mild.Imploring the continuance of God's providential
care for the year now entered, I went to the public devotions.The Dean
of the Chapel and Clerk of the Closet put out, viz, Bishop of London and
..., and Rochester and Durham put in their places; the former had
opposed the toleration intended, and shown a worthy zeal for the
reformed religion as established.I dined with the Archbishop of York, where was Peter
Walsh, that Romish priest so well known for his moderation, professing
the Church of England to be a true member of the Catholic Church.He is
used to go to our public prayers without scruple, and did not
acknowledge the Pope's infallibility, only primacy of order.Passed the Privy Seal, among others, the creation of
Mrs.Sedley (concubine to ----) Countess of Dorchester, which the Queen
took very grievously, so as for two dinners, standing near her, I
observed she hardly ate one morsel, nor spoke one word to the King, or
to any about her, though at other times she used to be extremely
pleasant, full of discourse and good humor.The Roman Catholics were
also very angry: because they had so long valued the sanctity of their
religion and proselytes.Dryden, the famous playwriter, and his two sons, and Mrs.Nelly (miss to
the late ----), were said to go to mass; such proselytes were no great
loss to the Church.This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's palace in
Bloomsbury, than which for painting and furniture there was nothing more
glorious in England.This happened by the negligence of a servant
airing, as they call it, some of the goods by the fire in a moist
season; indeed, so wet and mild a season had scarce been seen in man's
memory.At this Seal there also passed the creation of Sir Henry Waldegrave to
be a Peer.He had married one of the King's natural daughters by Mrs.These two Seals my brother Commissioners passed in the
morning before I came to town, at which I was not displeased.We
likewise passed Privy Seals for L276,000 upon several accounts,
pensions, guards, wardrobes, privy purse, etc., besides divers pardons,
and one more which I must not forget (and which by Providence I was not
present at) one Mr.Lytcott to be Secretary to the Ambassador to Rome.We being three Commissioners, any two were a quorum.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1686.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager, at Somerset House, where dined the Countesses of
Devonshire, Dover, etc.; in all eleven ladies of quality, no man but
myself being there.Unheard-of cruelties to the persecuted Protestants
of France, such as hardly any age has seen the like, even among the
Pagans.Being the day on which his Majesty began his reign,
by order of Council it was to be solemnized with a particular office and
sermon, which the Bishop of Ely preached at Whitehall on Numb.12; a
Court oration upon the regal office.It was much wondered at, that this
day, which was that of his late Majesty's death, should be kept as a
festival, and not the day of the present King's coronation.It is said
to have been formerly the custom, though not till now since the reign of
King James I.

The Duchess of Monmouth, being in the same seat with me at church,
appeared with a very sad and afflicted countenance.I took the test in Westminster Hall, before the Lord
Chief Justice.I now came to lodge at Whitehall, in the Lord Privy
Seal's lodgings.My great cause was heard by my Lord Chancellor, who
granted me a rehearing.I had six eminent lawyers, my antagonist three,
whereof one was the smooth-tongued solicitor, whom my Lord Chancellor
reproved in great passion for a very small occasion.Blessed be God for
his great goodness to me this day!Many bloody and notorious duels were fought about
this time.Stanley, brother to the Earl
of [Derby], indeed upon an almost insufferable provocation.It is to be
hoped that his Majesty will at last severely remedy this unchristian
custom.Lord Sunderland was now Secretary of State, President of the Council,
and Premier Minister.Came Sir Gilbert Gerrard to treat with me about his
son's marrying my daughter, Susanna.The father being obnoxious, and in
some suspicion and displeasure of the King, I would receive no proposal
till his Majesty had given me leave; which he was pleased to do; but,
after several meetings we broke off, on his not being willing to secure
anything competent for my daughter's children; besides that I found most
of his estate was in the coal-pits as far off as Newcastle, and on
leases from the Bishop of Durham, who had power to make concurrent
leases, with other difficulties.Frampton, Bishop of Gloucester, preached on Psalm
xliv.17, 18, 19, showing the several afflictions of the Church of
Christ from the primitive to this day, applying exceedingly to the
present conjuncture, when many were wavering in their minds, and great
temptations appearing through the favor now found by the <DW7>s, so as
the people were full of jealousies and discouragement.The Bishop
magnified the Church of England, exhorting to constancy and
perseverance.A Council of the Royal Society about disposing of Dr.Ray's book of Fishes, which was printed at the expense of the Society.A docket was to be sealed, importing a lease of
twenty-one years to one Hall, who styled himself his Majesty's printer
(he lately turned <DW7>) for the printing missals, offices, lives of
saints, portals, primers, etc., books expressly forbidden to be printed
or sold, by divers Acts of Parliament; I refused to put my seal to it,
making my exceptions, so it was laid by.The Bishop of Bath and Wells preached on John vi.17,
a most excellent and pathetic discourse: after he had recommended the
duty of fasting and other penitential duties, he exhorted to constancy
in the Protestant religion, detestation of the unheard-of cruelties of
the French, and stirring up to a liberal contribution.This sermon was
the more acceptable, as it was unexpected from a Bishop who had
undergone the censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof
no man could show more.This indeed did all our Bishops, to the
disabusing and reproach of all their delators: for none were more
zealous against Popery than they were.I was at a review of the army about London in Hyde
Park, about 6,000 horse and foot, in excellent order; his Majesty and
infinity of people being present.I went to my house in the country, refusing to be
present at what was to pass at the Privy Seal the next day.Tenison preached an incomparable discourse at Whitehall, on
Timothy ii.Cradock (Provost of Eaton) preached at the same
place, on Psalm xlix.13, showing the vanity of earthly enjoyments.White, Bishop of Peterborough, preached in a very
eloquent style, on Matthew xxvi.29, submission to the will of God on
all accidents, and at all times.The Duke of Northumberland (a natural son of the late
King by the Duchess of Cleveland) marrying very meanly, with the help of
his brother Grafton, attempted in vain to spirit away his wife.A Brief was read in all churches for relieving the French Protestants,
who came here for protection from the unheard-of cruelties of the King.Sir Edward Hales, a <DW7>, made Governor of Dover
Castle.The Archbishop of York now died of the smallpox, aged
62, a corpulent man.He was my special loving friend, and while Bishop
of Rochester (from whence he was translated) my excellent neighbor.He
was an inexpressible loss to the whole church, and that Province
especially, being a learned, wise, stout, and most worthy prelate; I
look on this as a great stroke to the poor Church of England, now in
this defecting period.In the afternoon I went to Camberwell, to visit Dr.After sermon, I accompanied him to his house, where he showed me
the Life and Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher), and
among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the Primate, giving
notice of the Popish practices to pervert this nation, by sending a
hundred priests into England, who were to conform themselves to all
sectaries and conditions for the more easily dispersing their doctrine
among us.This letter was the cause of the whole impression being
seized, upon pretense that it was a political or historical account of
things not relating to theology, though it had been licensed by the
Bishop; which plainly showed what an interest the <DW7>s now had,--that
a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of so eminent a man,
was not to be published.There were also many letters to and from most
of the learned persons his correspondents in Europe.The book will, I
doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment.Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones put in.This day was read in our church the Brief for a
collection for relief of the Protestant French so cruelly, barbarously,
and inhumanly oppressed without any thing being laid to their charge.It
had been long expected, and at last with difficulty procured to be
published, the interest of the French Ambassador obstructing it.There being a Seal, it was feared we should be required
to pass a docket dispensing with Dr.Obadiah Walker and four more,
whereof one was an apostate curate of Putney, the others officers of
University College, Oxford, who hold their masterships, fellowships, and
cures, and keep public schools, and enjoy all former emoluments,
notwithstanding they no more frequented or used the public forms of
prayers, or communion, with the Church of England, or took the Test or
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, contrary to twenty Acts of
Parliament; which dispensation being also contrary to his Majesty's own
gracious declaration at the beginning of his reign, gave umbrage (as
well it might) to every good Protestant; nor could we safely have passed
it under the Privy Seal, wherefore it was done by immediate warrant,
signed by Mr.This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish life, to whose tuition I
had more than thirty years since recommended the sons of my worthy
friend, Mr.Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey, believing him to be far from
what he proved--a hypocritical concealed <DW7>--by which he perverted
the eldest son of Mr.Hyldyard, Sir Edward Hale's eldest son, and
several more, to the great disturbance of the whole nation, as well as
of the University, as by his now public defection appeared.All engines
being now at work to bring in Popery, which God in mercy prevent![Sidenote: LONDON]

This day was burned in the old Exchange, by the common hangman, a
translation of a book written by the famous Monsieur Claude, relating
only matters of fact concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous
proceedings of the French King against his Protestant subjects, without
any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a power and ascendant
here had the French Ambassador, who was doubtless in great indignation
at the pious and truly generous charity of all the nation, for the
relief of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter.About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by the French King
to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont, slew many thousands of those
innocent people, so that there seemed to be an universal design to
destroy all that would not go to mass, throughout Europe._Quod Avertat
D. O.M.!_ No faith in Princes!I refused to put the Privy Seal to Doctor Walker's
license for printing and publishing divers Popish books, of which I
complained both to my Lord of Canterbury (with whom I went to advise in
the Council Chamber), and to my Lord Treasurer that evening at his
lodgings.My Lord of Canterbury's advice was, that I should follow my
own conscience therein; Mr.Treasurer's, that if in conscience I could
dispense with it, for any other hazard he believed there was none.Notwithstanding this, I persisted in my refusal.There was no sermon on this anniversary, as there
usually had been ever since the reign of the present King.Such storms, rain, and foul weather, seldom known at this
time of the year.The camp at Hounslow Heath, from sickness and other
inconveniences of weather, forced to retire to quarters; the storms
being succeeded by excessive hot weather, many grew sick.Great feasting
there, especially in Lord Dunbarton's quarters.There were many
jealousies and discourses of what was the meaning of this encampment.A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of Knight Baronets'
fees, which having been passed over for so many years, did greatly
disoblige several families who had served his Majesty.Lord Tyrconnel
gone to Ireland, with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause
of talk as the camp, especially nineteen new Privy-Councillors and
Judges being now made, among which but three Protestants, and Tyrconnel
made General.New judges also here, among which was Milton, a <DW7> (brother to that
Milton who wrote for the Regicides), who presumed to take his place
without passing the Test.Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to
the <DW7>s there.The Protestants in Savoy
successfully resist the French dragoons sent to murder them.The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing from the Protestant
religion, does of his own accord publish his recantation at Edinburg.I went to see Middleton's receptacle of water at the
New River, and the New Spa Wells near.My Lord Treasurer settled my great business with Mr.Pretyman, to which I hope God will at last give a prosperous issue.Sharp and Tully,
proceeded to silence and suspend divers excellent divines for preaching
against Popery.I had this day been married thirty-nine years--blessed
be God for all his mercies!The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared on the bench,
that the government of England was entirely in the King; that the Crown
was absolute; that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable
the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to bind
the King's power; that he could pardon all offenses against the law, and
forgive the penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by which
the Test was abolished?Great jealousies as to
what would be the end of these proceedings.I supped with the Countess of Rochester, where was also
the Duchess of Buckingham and Madame de Governe, whose daughter was
married to the Marquis of Halifax's son.She made me a character of the
French King and Dauphin, and of the persecution; that they kept much of
the cruelties from the King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid
of his father, that he dared not let anything appear of his sentiments;
that he hated letters and priests, spent all his time in hunting, and
seemed to take no notice of what was passing.This lady was of a great family and fortune, and had fled hither for
refuge.I waited on the Archbishop at Lambeth, where I dined and
met the famous preacher and writer, Dr.Allix, doubtless a most
excellent and learned person.The Archbishop and he spoke Latin
together, and that very readily.Meggot, Dean of Winchester preached before the
household in St.George's Chapel at Windsor, the late King's glorious
chapel now seized on by the mass priests.Cartwright, Dean of Ripon,
preached before the great men of the Court in the same place.We had now the sad news of the Bishop of Oxford's death, an
extraordinary loss to the poor Church at this time.Many candidates for
his Bishopric and Deanery, Dr.Parker, South, Aldrich, etc.Walker
(now apostatizing) came to Court, and was doubtless very busy.Note, that standing by the Queen at basset (cards), I
observed that she was exceedingly concerned for the loss of L80; her
outward affability much changed to stateliness, since she has been
exalted.The season very rainy and inconvenient for the camps.Was sealed at our office the constitution of certain
commissioners to take upon them full power of all Ecclesiastical
affairs, in as unlimited a manner, or rather greater, than the late High
Commission-Court, abrogated by Parliament; for it had not only faculty
to inspect and visit all Bishops' dioceses, but to change what laws and
statutes they should think fit to alter among the colleges, though
founded by private men; to punish, suspend, fine, etc., give oaths and
call witnesses.The main drift was to suppress zealous preachers.In
sum, it was the whole power of a Vicar-General--note the consequence!Of
the clergy the commissioners were the Archbishop of Canterbury
[Sancroft], Bishop of Durham [Crewe], and Rochester [Sprat]; of the
Temporals, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Chancellor [Jefferies] (who
alone was ever to be of the quorum), the Chief justice [Herbert], and
Lord President [Earl of Sunderland].I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Greenwich.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th August, 1686.I dined at Signor Verrio's, the famous Italian
painter, now settled in his Majesty's garden at St.James's, which he
had made a very delicious paradise.Our vicar gone to dispose of his country living in
Rutlandshire, having St.Dunstan in the east given him by the Archbishop
of Canterbury.I went to visit the Marquis Ravigne, now my neighbor at Greenwich,
retired from the persecution in France.He was the deputy of all the
Protestants of that kingdom in the parliament of Paris, and several
times Ambassador in this and other Courts; a person of great learning
and experience.Compton, Bishop of London, was on Monday
suspended, on pretense of not silencing Dr.Giles's, for
something of a sermon in which he zealously reproved the doctrine of the
Roman Catholics.The Bishop having consulted the civilians, they told
him he could not by any law proceed against Dr.Sharp without producing
witnesses, and impleaded according to form; but it was overruled by my
Lord Chancellor, and the Bishop sentenced without so much as being heard
to any purpose.This was thought a very extraordinary way of proceeding,
and was universally resented, and so much the rather for that two
Bishops, Durham and Rochester, sitting in the commission and giving
their suffrages the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to sit among them.He was only suspended _ab officio_, and that was soon after taken off.He was brother to the Earl of Northampton, had once been a soldier, had
traveled in Italy, but became a sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Buda now taken from the Turks; a form of
thanksgiving was ordered to be used in the (as yet remaining) Protestant
chapels and church of Whitehall and Windsor.The King of Denmark was besieging Hamburg, no doubt by the French
contrivance, to embroil the Protestant Princes in a new war, that
Holland, etc., being engaged, matter for new quarrel might arise: the
unheard-of persecution of the poor Protestants still raging more than
ever.The Danes retire from Hamburg, the Protestant
Princes appearing for their succor, and the Emperor sending his
minatories to the King of Denmark, and also requiring the restoration of
the Duke of Saxe Gotha.Thus it pleased God to defeat the French
designs, which were evidently to kindle a new war.His Majesty's birthday; I was at his rising in his
bedchamber, afterward in the park, where four companies of guards were
drawn up.The officers, etc., wonderfully rich and gallant; they did not
head their troops, but their next officers, the colonels being on
horseback by the King while they marched.The ladies not less splendid
at Court, where there was a ball at night; but small appearance of
quality.All the shops both in the city and suburbs were shut up, and
kept as solemnly as any holiday.Bonfires at night in Westminster, but
forbidden in the city.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Covent Garden Church on Ephes.18, 19, showing the custom of the
primitive saints in serving God with hymns, and their frequent use of
them upon all occasions: touching the profane way of mirth and
intemperance of this ungodly age.Afterward I visited my Lord Chief
Justice of Ireland, with whom I had long and private discourse
concerning the miserable condition that kingdom was like to be in, if
Tyrconnel's counsel should prevail at Court.Went with the Countess of Sunderland to Cranbourne,
a lodge and walk of my Lord Godolphin's in Windsor park.There was one
room in the house spared in the pulling down the old one, because the
late Duchess of York was born in it; the rest was built and added to it
by Sir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy; and since, the whole was
purchased by my Lord Godolphin, who spoke to me to go see it, and advise
what trees were fit to be cut down to improve the dwelling, being
environed with old rotten pollards, which corrupt the air.It stands on
a knoll which though insensibly rising, gives it a prospect over the
Keep of Windsor, about three miles N. E. of it.The ground is clayey and
moist; the water stark naught; the park is pretty; the house tolerable,
and gardens convenient.After dinner, we came back to London, having two
coaches both going and coming, of six horses apiece, which we changed at
Hounslow.Warren preached before the Princess at
Whitehall, on 5th Matthew, of the blessedness of the pure in heart, most
elegantly describing the bliss of the beatifical vision.In the
afternoon, Sir George Wheeler, knight and baronet, preached on the 4th
Matt.Margaret's, an honest and
devout discourse, and pretty tolerably performed.This gentleman coming
from his travels out of Greece, fell in love with the daughter of Sir
Thomas Higgins, his Majesty's resident at Venice, niece to the Earl of
Bath, and married her.When they returned into England, being honored
with knighthood, he would needs turn preacher, and took orders.He
published a learned and ingenious book of his travels, and is a very
worthy person, a little formal and particular, but exceedingly devout.There was a triumphant show of the Lord Mayor both
by land and water, with much solemnity, when yet his power has been so
much diminished, by the loss of the city's former charter.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1686.Birch preached very boldly against the <DW7>s, from John xvi.Tillotson in Lincoln's Inn chapel, on the same
text, but more cautiously.I went with part of my family to pass the
melancholy winter in London at my son's house in Arundel Buildings.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager at Somerset House, where dined divers French
noblemen, driven out of their country by the persecution.I carried the Countess of Sunderland to see the
rarities of one Mr.Charlton in the Middle Temple, who showed us such a
collection as I had never seen in all my travels abroad either of
private gentlemen, or princes.It consisted of miniatures, drawings,
shells, insects, medals, natural things, animals (of which divers, I
think 100, were kept in glasses of spirits of wine), minerals, precious
stones, vessels, curiosities in amber, crystal, agate, etc.; all being
very perfect and rare of their kind, especially his books of birds,
fish, flowers, and shells, drawn and miniatured to the life.He told us
that one book stood him in L300; it was painted by that excellent
workman, whom the late Gaston, Duke of Orleans, employed.This
gentleman's whole collection, gathered by himself, traveling over most
parts of Europe, is estimated at L8,000.He appeared to be a modest and
obliging person.[62]

    [Footnote 62: This collection was afterward purchased by Sir Hans
    Sloane, and now forms part oL the British Museum.][Sidenote: LONDON]

29th December, 1686.I went to hear the music of the Italians in the
new chapel, now first opened publicly at Whitehall for the Popish
Service.Nothing can be finer than the magnificent marble work and
architecture at the end, where are four statues, representing St.Paul, and the Church, in white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, with all the carving and pillars of exquisite art and great
cost.The altar piece is the Salutation; the volto in _fresco_, the
Assumption of the blessed Virgin, according to their tradition, with our
blessed Savior, and a world of figures painted by Verrio.The throne
where the King and Queen sit is very glorious, in a closet above, just
opposite to the altar.Here we saw the Bishop in his mitre and rich
copes, with six or seven Jesuits and others in rich copes, sumptuously
habited, often taking off and putting on the Bishop's mitre, who sat in
a chair with arms pontifically, was adored and censed by three Jesuits
in their copes; then he went to the altar and made divers cringes, then
censing the images and glorious tabernacle placed on the altar, and now
and then changing place: the crosier, which was of silver, was put into
his hand with a world of mysterious ceremony, the music playing, with
singing.I could not have believed I should ever have seen such things
in the King of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten
this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed the
blessing, which I hope he will in mercy and his good time restore to its
purity.He wrote excellently, in answer
to the Bishop of Meaux.A Seal to confirm a gift of L4,000 per annum for 99
years to the Lord Treasurer out of the Post Office, and L1,700 per annum
for ever out of Lord Grey's estate.There was now another change of the great officers.The Treasury was put
into commission, two professed <DW7>s among them, viz, Lords Bellasis
and Dover, joined with the old ones, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen Fox,
and Sir John Ernley.Much expectation of several great men declaring
themselves <DW7>s.Lord Tyrconnel gone to succeed the Lord-Lieutenant
[Clarendon] in Ireland, to the astonishment of all sober men, and to the
evident ruin of the Protestants in that kingdom, as well as of its great
improvement going on.Much discourse that all the White Staff officers
and others should be dismissed for adhering to their religion.Popish
Justices of the Peace established in all counties, of the meanest of the
people; Judges ignorant of the law, and perverting it--so furiously do
the Jesuits drive, and even compel Princes to violent courses, and
destruction of an excellent government both in Church and State.God of
his infinite mercy open our eyes, and turn our hearts, and establish his
truth with peace!The Lord Jesus defend his little flock, and preserve
this threatened church and nation!I saw the Queen's new apartment at Whitehall, with
her new bed, the embroidery of which cost L3,000.The carving about the
chimney piece, by Gibbons, is incomparable.I heard the famous eunuch, Cifaccio, sing in the new
Popish chapel this afternoon; it was indeed very rare, and with great
skill.He came over from Rome, esteemed one of the best voices in Italy.Chetwin preached at Whitehall on Rom.18, a
very quaint, neat discourse of Moral righteousness.Came out a proclamation for universal liberty of
conscience in Scotland, and depensation from all tests and laws to the
contrary, as also capacitating <DW7>s to be chosen into all offices of
trust.Meggott, Dean of Winchester, preached before the
Princess of Denmark, on Matt.In the afternoon, I went out of
town to meet my Lord Clarendon, returning from Ireland.His Majesty sent for the Commissioners of the Privy
Seal this morning into his bedchamber, and told us that though he had
thought fit to dispose of the Seal into a single hand, yet he would so
provide for us, as it should appear how well he accepted our faithful
and loyal service with many gracious expressions to this effect; upon
which we delivered the Seal into his hands.It was by all the world both
hoped and expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord Clarendon;
but they were astonished to see it given to Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a
zealous Roman Catholic.Indeed it was very hard, and looked very
unkindly, his Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my going
to visit him and long discoursing with him about the affairs of Ireland)
finding not the least failure of duty in him during his government of
that kingdom, so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the
stronger influence of the <DW7>s, who now got all the preferments.Most of the great officers, both in the Court and country, Lords and
others, were dismissed, as they would not promise his Majesty their
consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes against Popish
Recusants.To this end, most of the Parliament men were spoken to in his
Majesty's closet, and such as refused, if in any place of office or
trust, civil or military, were put out of their employments.This was a
time of great trial; but hardly one of them assented, which put the
Popish interest much backward.The English clergy everywhere preached
boldly against their superstition and errors, and were wonderfully
followed by the people.Not one considerable proselyte was made in all
this time.The party were exceedingly put to the worst by the preaching
and writing of the Protestants in many excellent treatises, evincing the
doctrine and discipline of the reformed religion, to the manifest
disadvantage of their adversaries.To this did not a little contribute
the sermon preached at Whitehall before the Princess of Denmark and a
great crowd of people, and at least thirty of the greatest nobility, by
Dr.Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on John viii.46 (the Gospel of the
day), describing through his whole discourse the blasphemies, perfidy,
wresting of Scripture, preference of tradition before it, spirit of
persecution, superstition, legends, and fables of the Scribes and
Pharisees, so that all the auditory understood his meaning of a parallel
between them and the Romish priests, and their new Trent religion.He
exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word, and to persevere in
the Faith taught in the Church of England, whose doctrine for Catholic
and soundness he preferred to all the communities and churches of
Christians in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy, that
whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial emerge to the
confusion of her adversaries and the glory of God.I went this evening to see the order of the boys and children at
Christ's Hospital.There were near 800 boys and girls so decently clad,
cleanly lodged, so wholesomely fed, so admirably taught, some the
mathematics, especially the forty of the late King's foundation, that I
was delighted to see the progress some little youths of thirteen or
fourteen years of age had made.I saw them at supper, visited their
dormitories, and much admired the order, economy, and excellent
government of this most charitable seminary.Some are taught for the
Universities, others designed for seamen, all for trades and callings.The girls are instructed in all such work as becomes their sex and may
fit them for good wives, mistresses, and to be a blessing to their
generation.They sang a psalm before they sat down to supper in the
great Hall, to an organ which played all the time, with such cheerful
harmony, that it seemed to me a vision of angels.I came from the place
with infinite satisfaction, having never seen a more noble, pious, and
admirable charity.[63] The
foundation was of that pious Prince King Edward VI., whose picture (held
to be an original of Holbein) is in the court where the Governors meet
to consult on the affairs of the Hospital, and his statue in white
marble stands in a niche of the wall below, as you go to the church,
which is a modern, noble, and ample fabric.This foundation has had, and
still has, many benefactors.[Footnote 63: This is by no means the case now.]I saw a trial of those devilish, murdering, mischief
doing engines called bombs, shot out of the mortar piece on Blackheath.The distance that they are cast, the destruction they make where they
fall, is prodigious.Martin's to a crowd of people not to be expressed, nor the wonderful
eloquence of this admirable preacher; the text was Matt.36 to
verse 40, describing the bitterness of our Blessed Savior's agony, the
ardor of his love, the infinite obligations we have to imitate his
patience and resignation; the means by watching against temptations, and
over ourselves with fervent prayer to attain it, and the exceeding
reward in the end.Upon all which he made most pathetical discourses.The Communion followed, at which I was participant.Tenison's with the Bishop and that young, most learned, pious, and
excellent preacher, Mr.In the afternoon, I went to hear Mr.Wake
at the newly built church of St.34, upon the
subject of taking up the cross, and strenuously behaving ourselves in
time of persecution, as this now threatened to be.His Majesty again prorogued the Parliament, foreseeing it would not
remit the laws against <DW7>s, by the extraordinary zeal and bravery of
its members, and the free renunciation of the great officers both in
Court and state, who would not be prevailed with for any temporal
concern.During the service, a man came into near the middle of the
church, with his sword drawn, with several others in that posture; in
this jealous time it put the congregation into great confusion, but it
appeared to be one who fled for sanctuary, being pursued by bailiffs.I had a rehearing of my great cause at the Chancery in
Westminster Hall, having seven of the most learned Counsel, my adversary
five, among which were the Attorney General and late Solicitor Finch,
son to the Lord Chancellor Nottingham.The account was at last brought
to one article of the surcharge, and referred to a Master.The cause
lasted two hours and more.In the last week there was issued a Dispensation from
all obligations and tests, by which Dissenters and <DW7>s especially
had public liberty of exercising their several ways of worship, without
incurring the penalty of the many Laws and Acts of Parliament to the
contrary.This was purely obtained by the <DW7>s, thinking thereby to
ruin the Church of England, being now the only church which so admirably
and strenuously opposed their superstition.There was a wonderful
concourse of people at the Dissenters' meeting house in this parish, and
the parish church [Deptford] left exceedingly thin.What this will end
in, God Almighty only knows; but it looks like confusion, which I pray
God avert.[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th April, 1687.To London about my suit, some terms of accommodation
being proposed.I heard the famous singer, Cifaccio, esteemed the best
in Europe.Indeed, his holding out and delicateness in extending and
loosing a note with incomparable softness and sweetness, was admirable;
for the rest I found him a mere wanton, effeminate child, very coy, and
proudly conceited, to my apprehension.He touched the harpsichord to his
voice rarely well.This was before a select number of particular persons
whom Mr.Pepys invited to his house; and this was obtained by particular
favor and much difficulty, the Signor much disdaining to show his talent
to any but princes.At Greenwich, at the conclusion of the Church service,
there was a French sermon preached after the use of the English Liturgy
translated into French, to a congregation of about 100 French refugees,
of whom Monsieur Ruvigny was the chief, and had obtained the use of the
church, after the parish service was ended.The preacher pathetically
exhorted to patience, constancy, and reliance on God amidst all their
sufferings, and the infinite rewards to come.I dined with Mynheer Diskvelts, the Holland Ambassador, a
prudent and worthy person.There dined Lord Middleton, principal
Secretary of State, Lord Pembroke, Lord Lumley, Lord Preston, Colonel
Fitzpatrick, and Sir John Chardin.After dinner, the Ambassador
discoursed of and deplored the stupid folly of our politics, in
suffering the French to take Luxemburg, it being a place of the most
concern to have been defended, for the interest not only of the
Netherlands, but of England.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th May, 1687.Lord Sunderland being Lord President and
Secretary of State, was made Knight of the Garter and Prime favorite.This day there was such a storm of wind as had seldom happened, being a
sort of hurricane.It kept the flood out of the Thames, so that people
went on foot over several places above bridge.Also an earthquake in
several places in England about the time of the storm.Pretyman, after
my tedious suit.I went to London, it having pleased his Majesty to grant
me a Privy Seal for L6,000, for discharge of the debt I had been so many
years persecuted for, it being indeed for money drawn over by my
father-in-law, Sir R. Browne, during his residence in the Court of
France, and so with a much greater sum due to Sir Richard from his
Majesty; and now this part of the arrear being paid, there remains yet
due to me, as executor of Sir Richard, above L6,500 more; but this
determining an expensive Chancery suit has been so great a mercy and
providence to me (through the kindness and friendship to me of Lord
Godolphin, one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,) that I do
acknowledge it with all imaginable thanks to my gracious God.I visited my Lady Pierpoint, daughter to Sir John
Evelyn, of Deane [in Wilts], now widow of Mr.Pierpoint, and mother of
the Earl of Kingston.She was now engaged in the marriage of my cousin,
Evelyn Pierpoint, her second son.There was about this time brought into the Downs a vast treasure, which
was sunk in a Spanish galleon about forty-five years ago, somewhere near
Hispaniola, or the Bahama islands, and was now weighed up by some
gentlemen, who were at the charge of divers, etc., to the enriching them
beyond all expectation.The Duke of Albemarle's share [Governor of
Jamaica] came to, I believe, L50,000.Some private gentlemen who
adventured L100, gained from L8,000 to L10,000.His Majesty's tenth was
L10,000.The Camp was now again pitched at Hounslow, the Commanders profusely
vying in the expense and magnificence of tents.21, upon the danger
of relapsing into sin.After this, I went and heard M. Lamot, an
eloquent French preacher at Greenwich, on Prov.8, 9, a consolatory
discourse to the poor and religious refugees who escaped out of France
in the cruel persecution.I went to Hampton Court to give his Majesty thanks for
his late gracious favor, though it was but granting what was due.While
I was in the Council Chamber, came in some persons, at the head of whom
was a formal man with a large roll of parchment in his hand, being an
ADDRESS (as he said, for he introduced it with a speech) of the people
of Coventry, giving his Majesty their great acknowledgments for his
granting a liberty of conscience; he added that this was not the
application of one party only, but the unanimous address of Church of
England men, Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptists, to show how
extensive his Majesty's grace was, as taking in all parties to his
indulgence and protection, which had removed all dissensions and
animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds of Christian
charity, but exceedingly encourage their future industry, to the
improvement of trade, and spreading his Majesty's glory throughout the
world; and that now he had given to God his empire, God would establish
his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission; and so he gave
the roll to the King, which being returned to him again, his Majesty
caused him to read.The address was short, but much to the substance of
the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said
that what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was
ever his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them
in their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor to
settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.After this, he gave them his hand to kiss.It was reported the
subscribers were above 1,000.But this is not so remarkable as an address of the week before (as I was
assured by one present), of some of the FAMILY OF LOVE, His Majesty
asked them what this worship consisted in, and how many their party
might consist of; they told him their custom was to read the Scripture,
and then to preach; but did not give any further account, only said that
for the rest they were a sort of refined Quakers, but their number very
small, not consisting, as they said, of above threescore in all, and
those chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.Blathwaite's (two miles from Hampton).This gentleman is Secretary of War, Clerk of the Council, etc., having
raised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances.He is a
very proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and besides
all this, has married a great fortune.His income by the Army, Council,
and Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, brings him in
above L2,000 per annum.The Privy Seal for L6,000 was passed to me, so that this
tedious affair was dispatched.Hitherto, a very windy and tempestuous
summer.The French sermons to the refugees were continued at Greenwich
Church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1687.In the way, I dined at Ashted, with
my Lady Mordaunt.I went to see Albury, now purchased by Mr.Finch (the
King's Solicitor and son to the late Lord Chancellor); I found the
garden which I first designed for the Duke of Norfolk, nothing improved.I went to visit Lord Clarendon at Swallowfield, where
was my Lord Cornbury just arrived from Denmark, whither he had
accompanied the Prince of Denmark two months before, and now come back.The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he related to us;
the King keeps them under an army of 40,000 men, all Germans, he not
daring to trust his own subjects.Notwithstanding this, the Danes are
exceedingly proud, the country very poor and miserable.Returned home to Sayes Court from Wotton, having been
five weeks absent with my brother and friends, who entertained us very
nobly.God be praised for his goodness, and this refreshment after my
many troubles, and let his mercy and providence ever preserve me.The Lord Mayor sent me an Officer with a staff, to
be one of the Governors of St.PERSECUTION RAGING IN FRANCE; divers churches there fired by lightning,
priests struck, consecrated hosts, etc., burnt and destroyed, both at
St.Malos and Paris, at the grand procession on Corpus Christi day.I went to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop.After dinner, I retired into the library, which I found exceedingly
improved; there are also divers rare manuscripts in a room apart.I was godfather to Sir John Chardin's son, christened
at Greenwich Church, named John.The Earl of Bath and Countess of
Carlisle, the other sponsors.An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a
mechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor.The King and Queen, and Dadi, the
Pope's Nuncio, invited to a feast at Guildhall.A strange turn of
affairs, that those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers of
Popery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome, one who
represented the very person of their Antichrist!My son was returned out of Devon, where he had been
on a commission from the Lords of the Treasury about a concealment of
land.I went with my Lord Chief-Justice Herbert, to see
his house at Walton-on-Thames: it is a barren place.To a very ordinary
house he had built a very handsome library, designing more building to
it than the place deserves, in my opinion.He desired my advice about
laying out his gardens, etc.The next day, we went to Weybridge, to see
some pictures of the Duchess of Norfolk's, particularly the statue, or
child in gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons to
think it rather a copy, from some proportion in the figures ill taken.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, being under
very deplorable circumstances on account of his creditors, and
especially the King, I did my endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to
be favorable to him.My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton, being now married to
Lady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord
President of the Council, I and my family had most glorious favors sent
us, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary splendor.There was a solemn and particular office used at
our, and all the churches of London and ten miles round, for a
thanksgiving to God, for her Majesty being with child.This afternoon I went not to church, being employed
on a religious treatise I had undertaken._Post annum 1588--1660--1688, Annus Mirabilis Tertius._[64]

    [Footnote 64: This seems to have been added after the page was
    written.]Being the Martyrdom day of King Charles I., our
curate made a florid oration against the murder of that excellent
Prince, with an exhortation to obedience from the example of David; 1
Samuel xxvi.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1688.My daughter Evelyn going in the coach to visit in
the city, a jolt (the door being not fast shut) flung her quite out in
such manner, as the hind wheels passed over her a little above her
knees.Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels, she had no
other harm.In two days she was able to walk, and soon after perfectly
well; through God Almighty's great mercy to an excellent wife and a most
dutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.I received the sad news of my niece Montague's
death at Woodcot on the 15th.I gave in my account about the sick and wounded, in
order to have my quietus.Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately published
his extravagant treatise about transubstantiation, and for abrogating
the test and penal laws, died.He was esteemed a violent, passionate,
haughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the Church of Rome, he
utterly refused it.The French TYRANT now finding he could make no proselytes among those
Protestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in
dungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so
long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom,
but utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great
numbers came daily into England and other places, where they were
received and relieved with very considerate Christian charity.This
Providence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out,
did so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to avoid the
persecution, signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went
to mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in
their conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great
numbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and
lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to
return to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but
peaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but
so without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebellion or
sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly,
meeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers
and priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever
they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced
death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their
persecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former
assembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible
constancy, that through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this
lapse.Such examples of Christian behavior have not been seen since the
primitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in
the end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on
his Providence.I went with Sir Charles Littleton to Sheen, a house
and estate given him by Lord Brounker; one who was ever noted for a
hard, covetous, vicious man; but for his worldly craft and skill in
gaming few exceeded him.Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land,
house, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of
relation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of
Colchester, forty years before.It is a pretty place, with fine gardens,
and well planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles being an
honest gentleman and soldier.He is brother to Sir Henry Littleton of
Worcestershire, whose great estate he is likely to inherit, his brother
being without children.They are descendants of the great lawyer of that
name, and give the same arms and motto.Temple, formerly maid of honor to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and
he has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune.After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's near to it; the
most remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the
wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better
than I ever noted.There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke's, in both these
houses, and some few statues and small busts in the latter.From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel's, whose orangery and
_myrtetum_ are most beautiful and perfectly well kept.He was contriving
very high palisadoes of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,
and painting those reeds in oil.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st April, 1688.In the morning, the first sermon was by Dr.Paul's (at Whitehall), on Luke x.The
Holy Communion followed, but was so interrupted by the rude breaking in
of multitudes zealous to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office could
hardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed without great
trouble.The Princess being come, he preached on Mich.8, 9, 10,
describing the calamity of the Reformed Church of Judah under the
Babylonian persecution, for her sins, and God's delivery of her on her
repentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now Reformed Church,
whenever insulted and persecuted.He preached with his accustomed
action, zeal, and energy, so that people flocked from all quarters to
hear him.A dry, cold, backward spring; easterly winds.The persecution still raging in France, multitudes of Protestants, and
many very considerable and great persons flying hither, produced a
second general contribution, the <DW7>s, by God's Providence, as yet
making small progress among us.The weather was, till now, so cold and sharp, by an
almost perpetual east wind, which had continued many months, that there
was little appearance of any spring, and yet the winter was very
favorable as to frost and snow.To London, about my petition for allowances upon the
account of Commissioner for Sick and Wounded in the former war with
Holland.His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet of the Dutch
(while we had a very inconsiderable one), went down to Chatham; their
fleet was well prepared, and out, before we were in any readiness, or
had any considerable number to have encountered them, had there been
occasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while being in profound
peace, there was a mighty land army, which there was no need of, and no
force at sea, where only was the apprehension; but the army was
doubtless kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance
Popery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by many instances
pursued by the Jesuits, against his first resolution to alter nothing in
the Church Establishment, so that it appeared there can be no reliance
on Popish promises.The King enjoining the ministers to read his
Declaration for giving liberty of conscience (as it was styled) in all
churches of England, this evening, six Bishops, Bath and Wells,[65]
Peterborough,[66] Ely,[67] Chichester,[68] St.Asaph,[69] and
Bristol,[70] in the name of all the rest of the Bishops, came to his
Majesty to petition him, that he would not impose the reading of it to
the several congregations within their dioceses; not that they were
averse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness toward
dissenters, in relation to whom they should be willing to come to such a
temper as should be thought fit, when that matter might be considered
and settled in Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration
being founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside
all laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared to them illegal, as it
had done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of
such consequence, that they could not so far make themselves parties to
it, as the reading of it in church in time of divine service amounted
to.[Footnote 70: Sir John Trelawny, Bart.]The King was so far incensed at this address, that he with threatening
expressions commanded them to obey him in reading it at their perils,
and so dismissed them.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th May, 1688.I went to Whitehall Chapel, where, after the morning
lessons, the Declaration was read by one of the choir who used to read
the chapters.I hear it was in the Abbey Church, Westminster, but almost
universally forborne throughout all London: the consequences of which a
little time will show.All the discourse now was about the Bishops refusing to
read the injunction for the abolition of the Test, etc.It seems the
injunction came so crudely from the Secretary's office, that it was
neither sealed nor signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so
as the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the Court to great
difficulties how to proceed against them.Great were the consults, and a
proclamation was expected all this day; but nothing was done.The action
of the Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many adverse
parties, <DW7>s only excepted, who were now exceedingly perplexed, and
violent courses were every moment expected.Report was, that the
Protestant secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into Portugal, now on the
sudden, on allegation of a great debt owing her by his Majesty disabling
her, declares her resolution to stay.News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that was almost ever
heard of, subverting the city of Lima and country in Peru, with a
dreadful inundation following it.This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the
Bishops of Ely, Chichester, St.Asaph, Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath
and Wells, were sent from the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for
refusing to give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the
Declaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give bail, as it
would have prejudiced their peerage.The concern of the people for them
was wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their blessing,
and praying for them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower
wharf.A YOUNG PRINCE born, which will cause disputes.About two o'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged, and the bells
ring for the birth of a Prince of Wales.This was very surprising, it
having been universally given out that her Majesty did not look till the
next month.I went to the Tower to see the Bishops, visited the
Archbishop and the Bishops of Ely, St.Being the first day of term, the Bishops were brought
to Westminster on habeas corpus, when the indictment was read, and they
were called on to plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was
illegal; but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded.The
Court then offered to take bail for their appearance; but this they
refused, and at last were dismissed on their own recognizances to appear
that day fortnight; the Archbishop in L200, the Bishops in L100 each.Was a day of thanksgiving in London and ten miles about
for the young Prince's birth; a form of prayer made for the purpose by
the Bishop of Rochester.They appeared; the trial lasted from nine in the
morning to past six in the evening, when the jury retired to consider of
their verdict, and the Court adjourned to nine the next morning.The
jury were locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an
acquittal; but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent.At length he
agreed with the others.The Chief Justice, Wright, behaved with great
moderation and civility to the Bishops.Alibone, a <DW7>, was strongly
against them; but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,
they were acquitted.When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and
there was a lane of people from the King's Bench to the water side, on
their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.Bonfires were made that night, and bells rung, which was taken very ill
at Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty Earls and Lords, etc., on
the bench, did not a little comfort them; but indeed they were all along
full of comfort and cheerful.Note, they denied to pay the Lieutenant of the Tower (Hales, who used
them very surlily), any fees, alleging that none were due.The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks, etc.The two judges, Holloway and Powell, were displaced.Godolphin and his brother Sir William to
St.Alban's, to see a library he would have bought of the widow of Dr.Cartwright, late Archdeacon of St.Alban's, a very good collection of
books, especially in divinity; he was to give L300 for them.Having seen
the GREAT CHURCH, now newly repaired by a public contribution, we
returned home.One of the King's chaplains preached before the Princess
on Exodus xiv.13, "Stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord,"
which he applied so boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of
England, that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders.The
Popish priests were not able to carry their cause against their learned
adversaries, who confounded them both by their disputes and writings.The camp now began at Hounslow, but the nation was in
high discontent.Colonel Titus, Sir Henry Vane (son of him who was executed for his
treason), and some other of the Presbyterians and Independent party,
were sworn of the Privy Council, from hopes of thereby diverting that
party from going over to the Bishops and Church of England, which now
they began to do, foreseeing the design of the <DW7>s to descend and
take in their most hateful of heretics (as they at other times expressed
them to be) to effect their own ends, now evident; the utter extirpation
of the Church of England first, and then the rest would follow.This night the fireworks were played off, that had been
prepared for the Queen's upsitting.We saw them to great advantage; they
were very fine, and cost some thousands of pounds, in the pyramids,
statues, etc., but were spent too soon for so long a preparation.I went to Lambeth to visit the Archbishop, whom I
found very cheerful.Tenison now told me there would suddenly be some
great thing discovered.This was the Prince of Orange intending to come
over.I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire, seventy
miles.A coach and four horses took up me and my son at Whitehall, and
carried us to Dunstable, where we arrived and dined at noon, and from
thence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe, four miles
beyond Northampton, where we arrived by seven o'clock that evening.Both
these coaches were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,
who invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she entertained me and my
son with very extraordinary kindness; I stayed till the Thursday.Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe, who was my
Lord's chaplain when ambassador in France, preached the shortest
discourse I ever heard; but what was defective in the amplitude of his
sermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least L600 a year in
spiritual advancement) had newly built, and made fit for a person of
quality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according
therewith.My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a very strong, large
house, built with stone, not altogether modern.They were enlarging the
garden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening
into the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers
painted with blue and gilded.There is a noble walk of elms toward the
front of the house by the bowling green.I was not in any room of the
house besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new
Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom I had known from a child)
entertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly
married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace,
and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to
Althorpe, twelve miles distant.[Sidenote: ALTHORPE]

The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in
form of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustered and _a la
moderne_; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state,
galleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince.It
is situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept, and
all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and
walks of trees, canals and fish ponds, and stored with game.And, what
is above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of
solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and
without, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is
any in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact
order, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble.The
meanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the
several tables, the good order and decency--in a word, the entire
economy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person.She is one who
for her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I
must ever honor and celebrate.I wish from my soul the Lord, her husband
(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous), was as worthy of
her, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself
unworthy!This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much
affliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of.The
Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable lady, has the
comfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy,
especially Mr.Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very
learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth.Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord
Spencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonors both his name and his
family, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all
imaginable care of his education.There is a daughter very young married
to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland,
but who yet gives no great presage of worth,--so universally
contaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age!But this is
again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who
has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable
accomplishments and virtue.I left this noble place and conversation, my lady
having provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we
went, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival.Northampton, having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become a
town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and
townhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself.Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter
to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any
longer among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the
Clergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in
prejudice of the Church of England.The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea and land, which
with no small progress Popery makes among us, puts us to many
difficulties.The Popish Irish soldiers commit many murders and insults;
the whole nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little Prince of Wales
by hand (so many of her Majesty's children having died infants) not
succeeding, a country nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give
it suck.I went to London, where I found the Court in the
utmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange's landing; which
put Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it
possible to find such a change.Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back
the good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the
Church of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the
people, who showed their high discontent at several things in the
Government.Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other
places in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of
greater calamities.God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put
themselves under the shadow of his wings, till these things be
overpassed.The Court in so extraordinary a consternation, on
assurance of the Prince of Orange's intention to land, that the writs
sent forth for a Parliament were recalled.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th October, 1688.16, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its
perfection above all traditions.After which, near 1,000 devout persons
partook of the Communion.The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit,
who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture
and railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they
pulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch
that it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion heightened to that
degree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the
dispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all
laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford.In
the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued
to remove Protestants and put in <DW7>s at Portsmouth and other places
of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal
discontent.It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed
passionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom
they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying
incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of
his expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent.To such a
strange temper, and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation
reduced, and of which I was an eyewitness.The apprehension was (and
with reason) that his Majesty's forces would neither at land nor sea
oppose them with that vigor requisite to repel invaders.The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and
the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by
their usual tricks.A letter was sent to the Archbishop of
Canterbury,[71] informing him, from good hands, of what was contriving
by them.A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was published.The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form of prayer against the feared
invasion.The letter was as follows:--

    "My Lord, The honor and reputation which your Grace's piety,
    prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not
    only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally
    from those Protestants among us who are Dissenters from her
    discipline; God Almighty's Providence and blessing upon your Grace's
    vigilancy and extraordinary endeavors will not suffer to be
    diminished in this conjuncture.The conversation I now and then have
    with some in place who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing
    in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church's adversaries,
    obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the
    rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been
    required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion among
    well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have
    no cause to apprehend.The plan of this and of all that which is to
    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who
    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all
    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them.They have,
    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should
    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest
    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally
    about the town.I do not at all question but your Grace will
    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will
    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined
    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is
    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say
    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which
    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of
    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or
    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW
    ESTABLISHED, which Church the <DW7>s tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,
    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is
    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so
    established, is but by an usurped authority.The antiquity of THAT
    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and
    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,
    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words
    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND
    BY LAW ESTABLISHED.And whosoever threatens to invade or come
    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they
    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them.My
    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I
    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all
    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does
    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove
    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your
    blessing.(From a copy in Evelyn's
    handwriting.)This day signal for the victory
of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex.The
wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day.Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet.Public prayers ordered to be read in the
churches against invasion.A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a
Popish chapel that had been set up in the city.Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty's
taking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the
Queen to intercede for him.It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some
reported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret
betrayed, which time may discover.There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc.The Queen Dowager, and all
the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor, were
to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth,
recorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two
after.This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to
condescend to, on the talk of the people.It was remarkable that on this
occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and
Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among <DW7>s, and their
bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred _praemunire_;--at least, if what I heard
be true.I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,
in the place of the Earl of Sunderland.Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of
Burlington.The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,
and her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.My birthday, being the 68th year of my age.O
blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from
those dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to
this sinful nation!Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,
disposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if
it be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which
hitherto thou hast continued to us!Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir
Stephen Fox's.Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no
certainty.Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but
without any assurance.A man was taken with divers papers and printed
manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet
Council.There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction
of all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French.There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords
both spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of
the causes of his enterprise.This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what
was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some
public writing of this disloyal charge.It was now certainly reported by some who saw the
fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on
Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take
leave of her husband.Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere
about Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would
have been northward.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1688.I went to London; heard the news of the Prince
having landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing
through the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them.This put the King and Court into great
consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their
further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways
very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and
Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth
their abhorrence of this invasion.They assured his Majesty that they
had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy
to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,
as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty
would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult
what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to
publish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the
Prince's manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the
Lords, spiritual and temporal.This did not please the King; so they
departed.A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the
Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his
expedition, as there had been one before from the States.These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it
by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us.This, in all
likelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we
cannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side.I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of
his people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and
Warner officiating.Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to
Honiton, the Prince's headquarters.The city of London in disorder; the
rabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the <DW7>s of Lord
Berkeley, at St.The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for
safety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful
aspect.The King goes to
Salisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London.Lord Delamere
appears for the Prince in Cheshire.The
Archbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in
London, address his Majesty to call a Parliament.The King invites all
foreign nations to come over.The French take all the Palatinate, and
alarm the Germans more than ever.We adjourned the
election of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public
commotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of
Halifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;
he told me they had little power.Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of
quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,
and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations
against the <DW7>s.The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,
fly or abscond.Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public
print, and is cried about the streets.Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford.The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to
Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.Address from the Fleet not
grateful to his Majesty.The <DW7>s in offices lay down their
commissions, and fly.Universal consternation among them; it looks like
a revolution.The rabble
demolished all Popish chapels, and several <DW7> lords and gentlemen's
houses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,
and burned his library.The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for
ballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to
St.James's, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General
of the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained
prisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his
Majesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be
quartered about the palace and city.This is taken heinously and the
King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on
the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I
was present).That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to
assent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1688.I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve
o'clock--a sad sight!James's, and fills
Whitehall with Dutch guards.A Council of Peers meet about an expedient
to call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords.The Chancellor,
Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.The Earl of Sunderland
flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.All the world go to see the Prince at St.James's, where there is a
great Court.There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came
over with him.He is very stately, serious and reserved.The English
soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.The King passes into France, whither the Queen and
child were gone a few days before.The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the
Parliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II.meeting, desire the
Prince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till
a convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by
his circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January.I had
now quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first
left off in our Church.A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost
frozen over.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I
found the Bishops of St.Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and
Chichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,
Lord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,
concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find
there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and
Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen
without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory
party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon
conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder.The Romanists were busy among these several
parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other
interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions.I found nothing
of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me
into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve
their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name,
by that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being.My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent
him in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,
and that it came very seasonably.I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were
indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in
that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this
conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that
kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with
the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at
present settled.It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took
my leave, most of the Lords being gone.The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the
question about the government, resolved that King James having by the
advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the
laws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away
the seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,
had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did
therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the
Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of
Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever
all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th January, 1689.I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a
child not twelve years old, the son of one Dr.Clench, of the most
prodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether
memory, but something more extraordinary.Pepys and myself examined
him, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required
judgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently.There was
not anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of
astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the
spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,
boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any
other part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and
demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he
would describe.He was able not only to repeat the most famous things
which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,
republics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred
stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the
monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower
Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of
the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms.We leaped from that
to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable
meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of
the Digest and Code.He gave a stupendous account of both natural and
moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or
angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in
knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard
of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the
Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms
without any contest.After a little thought, he told us that he knew of
nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to
meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little
conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was
received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world.He was perfect in the Latin
authors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,
Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient
Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further.He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who
had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going
about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a
lively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,
without the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by
causing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but
his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in
Latin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every
day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study.He was
perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek.In sum
(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of
anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who
has more knowledge than most men in the world.I counseled his father
not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

    "_Immodicis brevis est aetas, et rara senectus,_"

as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,
many years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in
shape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.The votes of the House of Commons being carried up
by Mr.Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the
Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much
of the debate, which lasted very long.Lord Derby was in the chair (for
the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after
all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three
voices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority
alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and
expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down
particularly.Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:
others that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers.There were not more than eight or nine
bishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,
on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the
bishops being cast out of the House.In short, things tended to
dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the
Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and
others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they
made their court.The English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland.Nothing was yet done
toward a settlement.God of his infinite mercy compose these things,
that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober
establishment!'s MARTYRDOM; but
in all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany
for the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated.Sharp preached
before the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.At our church (the next day being appointed a
thanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers
purposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very
honest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances
of our Church, without touching on politics.The King's coronation day was ordered not to be
observed, as hitherto it had been.The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and
Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland
(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being
to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to
be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in
both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of
such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of
such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that
failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit.These
produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented
heads of such new laws as were to be enacted.It is thought on these
conditions they will be proclaimed.There was much contest about the King's abdication, and whether he had
vacated the government.The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,
and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom
being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations
from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading
Flanders, and encountering the German Princes.It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in
many years.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st February, 1689.James's on the
obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of
the nation and church.I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her
coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation
and general good reception.It was believed
that both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)
reluctance at least, of assuming her father's crown, and made some
apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement
necessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would
have shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character
given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's first declaration,
that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the
nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall
laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,
before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the
convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the
late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as
the Queen, her predecessor used to do.She smiled upon and talked to
everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since
her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see
her, and that she went to our prayers.She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to
heart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is
wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike
gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France
calling for his care.Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden
assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some
conditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting
to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part
of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a
crown was tempting.This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all
preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been
given him.My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the
same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have
well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it
had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,
acquiescing in due time.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of
conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests
and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so
much as appeared out of Lambeth.This occasioned the wonder of many who
observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and
all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the
absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and
especially the <DW7>s.Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention
only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves
on the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head.The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,
the government requiring a speedy settlement.Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;
most of the old ones were turned out.Two or three white staves were
disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of
Devonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet
none in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as
Privy Seal.A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not
yet finished.Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent
discourse on Matt.44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of
enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about
impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while wise men
were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted,
an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men
in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did
not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the
absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of
the Prince of Wales was an imposture; five of the Bishops also still
refusing to take the new oath.In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax was remitted
forever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes
on land, is not named.The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and
officers for an expedition to Ireland.The great neglect in not more
timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland,
give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great offices among
themselves.The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission
of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give
success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten
the nation than could be expected.In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in
providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in
raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any
service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an
idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage, and many
disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th March, 1689.The new King much blamed for neglecting Ireland, now
likely to be ruined by the Lord Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too
strong for the Protestants.Wonderful uncertainty where King James was,
whether in France or Ireland.The Scots seem as yet to favor King
William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing
positively.Parliament preparing the
coronation oath.Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the vote for
preserving the Protestant religion as established by law, without
mentioning what they were to have as to indulgence.The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops refusing to come to
Parliament, it was deliberated whether they should incur _Praemunire_;
but it was thought fit to let this fall, and be connived at, for fear of
the people, to whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of
the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's
unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate, which they had
most barbarously ruined.I saw the procession to and from the Abbey Church of
Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster Hall, at the coronation
of King William and Queen Mary.What was different from former
coronations, was some alteration in the coronation oath.Burnet, now
made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause.The Parliament men
had scaffolds and places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and
other services by tenure were performed.The Parliament men were feasted
in the Exchequer chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them,
worth five-and-forty shillings.On the one side were the effigies of the
King and Queen inclining one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter
throwing a bolt at Phaeton the words, "_Ne totus absumatur_": which was
but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as
apposite.Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by the absence of
divers who should have contributed to it, there being but five Bishops,
four Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great
ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent.The next day the
House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the
Banqueting House.Asaph to visit my Lord
of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at
the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by
the Archbishop of York.We had much private and free discourse with his
Grace concerning several things relating to the Church, there being now
a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons.I
urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the
Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing in private
houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent
burials in churches; the one proceeding much from the pride of women,
bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent
danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of
the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of
ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of
permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings,
and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptizing in
chambers.To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavor to
get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might
cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save
such as were in new office, without any retrospect to such as either had
no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some
scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the
government as established by law.This we all knew to be the case of my
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so
fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King
James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d'Estrades,
whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the
Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit,
telling him that the King of France, his master, would never assist him
if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor
Prince is managed by the French.Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of
their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his
right by maladministration; they proceeded with much more caution and
prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach
of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty, ill-principled
men.The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly
undermining all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish
so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and
profit.This was one of the most seasonable springs, free from
the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year 1660 (the
year of the Restoration), which was much such an one.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1689.I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ
of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of
perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway,
etc., who were his judges.Asaph to
the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning
the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the third
trumpet and vial were now pouring out.Asaph considered the
killing of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the
Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, who by all appearance from good
history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till
now.The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident
that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful
people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them
in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc.xi.,
that they should both be slain together.Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too
hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French
minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present
state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly anyone
travels.There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in
Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of
that kingdom, to the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and which they
might so easily have done.This is a terrible beginning of more
troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people
being generally disaffected here and everywhere else, so that the seamen
and landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience
to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of
allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the bishops and others of the
clergy will not take.The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment.This is thought to have been driven on by the
Presbyterians, our new governors.God in mercy send us help, and direct
the counsels to his glory and good of his Church!Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissensions among
ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing
unskillful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and
ability appearing,--threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently setting on
them in a creek as they were landing men in Ireland, by which we came
off with great slaughter and little honor--so strangely negligent and
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet.The Scots
Commissioners offer the crown to the NEW KING AND QUEEN on
conditions.--Act of Poll-money came forth, sparing none.--Now appeared
the Act of Indulgence for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving in office
according to law, with several other clauses.--A most splendid embassy
from Holland to congratulate the King and Queen on their accession to
the crown.A solemn fast for success of the fleet, etc.I dined with the Bishop of Asaph; Monsieur Capellus, the
learned son of the most learned Ludovicus, presented to him his father's
works, not published till now.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, and stayed with
him till about seven o'clock.He read to me the Pope's excommunication
of the French King.Burnet, now Bishop of Sarum; got him to let
Mr.King James's declaration was now dispersed, offering
pardon to all, if on his landing, or within twenty days after, they
should return to their obedience.Our fleet not yet at sea, through some prodigious sloth, and men minding
only their present interest; the French riding masters at sea, taking
many great prizes to our wonderful reproach.No certain news from
Ireland; various reports of Scotland; discontents at home.The King of
Denmark at last joins with the Confederates, and the two Northern Powers
are reconciled.The East India Company likely to be dissolved by
Parliament for many arbitrary actions.Oates acquitted of perjury, to
all honest men's admiration.News of A PLOT discovered, on which divers were sent to
the Tower and secured.An extraordinary drought, to the threatening of great
wants as to the fruits of the earth.Pepys,
late Secretary to the Admiralty, holding my "Sylva" in my right hand.It
was on his long and earnest request, and is placed in his library.Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's
wedding day, when about three in the afternoon there was an unusual and
violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were
overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the
waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees
and ruining some houses.The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy
miles from London.It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did
much mischief.I went to Hampton Court about business, the Council
being there.A great apartment and spacious garden with fountains was
beginning in the park at the head of the canal.The Marshal de Schomberg went now as General toward
Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry.The
Confederates passing the Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a
passage into France.A great victory gotten by the Muscovites, taking
and burning Perecop.A new rebel against the Turks threatens the
destruction of that tyranny.All Europe in arms against France, and
hardly to be found in history so universal a face of war.The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting, exempt the
Duke of Hanover from the succession to the crown, which they seem to
confine to the present new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark,
who is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her being
thought with child may prove a TYMPANY only, so that the unhappy family
of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing; and then what government is
likely to be next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election, or
otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters from the Church of England
evidently looking that way.The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy there.Great discontents
through this nation at the slow proceedings of the King, and the
incompetent instruments and officers he advances to the greatest and
most necessary charges.Hitherto it has been a most seasonable summer.Londonderry relieved after a brave and wonderful holding out.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury since
his suspension, and was received with great kindness.A dreadful fire
happened in Southwark.Came to visit us the Marquis de Ruvigne, and one
Monsieur le Coque, a French refugee, who left great riches for his
religion; a very learned, civil person; he married the sister of the
Duchess de la Force.Ottobone, a Venetian Cardinal, eighty years old,
made Pope.[72]

    [Footnote 72: Peter Otthobonus succeeded Innocent XI.as Pope in
    1689, by the title of Alexander VIII.]My birthday, being now sixty-nine years old.Blessed
Father, who hast prolonged my years to this great age, and given me to
see so great and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them to
this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance of my prayers and
thankful acknowledgments, and grant me grace to be working out my
salvation and redeeming the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me
here, and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call for it, to
perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that heavenly kingdom where
there are no more changes or vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy,
and consummate felicity, forever.Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the
sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior.Asaph, Lord Almoner, preached
before the King and Queen, the whole discourse being an historical
narrative of the Church of England's several deliverances, especially
that of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday of the
Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the 4th), and his landing
at Torbay this day.There was a splendid ball and other rejoicings.After a very wet season, the winter came on
severely.Much wet, without frost, yet the wind north and
easterly.A Convocation of the Clergy meet about a reformation of our
Liturgy, Canons, etc., obstructed by others of the clergy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1689.I went to London with my family, to winter at Soho,
in the great square.This night there was a most extraordinary storm
of wind, accompanied with snow and sharp weather; it did great harm in
many places, blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people.It
began about two in the morning, and lasted till five, being a kind of
hurricane, which mariners observe have begun of late years to come
northward.This winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.Ann's Church an exhortatory
letter to the clergy of London from the Bishop, together with a Brief
for relieving the distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to the Protestant Cantons
of Switzerland.The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of April to the
discontent and surprise of many members who, being exceedingly averse to
the settling of anything, proceeding with animosities, multiplying
exceptions against those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves, as there
was before against King James.The new King resolved on an expedition
into Ireland in person.About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near St.Dunstan's,
sent some of their company to the King, to assure him of their service;
he returned his thanks, advising them to repair to their several
counties and preserve the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending the Laws and
Religion established.The great Lord suspected to have counselled this
prorogation, universally denied it.However, it was believed the chief
adviser was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be most in
favor.The Parliament was dissolved by proclamation, and
another called to meet the 20th of March.This was a second surprise to
the former members; and now the Court party, or, as they call
themselves, Church of England, are making their interests in the
country.The Marquis of Halifax lays down his office of Privy Seal, and
pretends to retire.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th February, 1690.The Duchess of Monmouth's chaplain preached at St.Martin's an excellent discourse exhorting to peace and sanctity, it
being now the time of very great division and dissension in the nation;
first, among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober part were for
a speedy reformation of divers things, which it was thought might be
made in our Liturgy, for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff
and rigid, were for no condescension at all.Books and pamphlets were
published every day pro and con; the Convocation were forced for the
present to suspend any further progress.There was fierce and great
carousing about being elected in the new Parliament.The King persists
in his intention of going in person for Ireland, whither the French are
sending supplies to King James, and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.I dined with the Marquis of Carmarthen (late Lord
Danby), where was Lieutenant-General Douglas, a very considerate and
sober commander, going for Ireland.He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for want of clothes
and necessaries this winter, exceedingly magnifying their courage and
bravery during all their hardships.There dined also Lord Lucas,
Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Bishop of St.The Privy Seal was
again put in commission, Mr.Cheny (who married my kinswoman, Mrs.Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney.The
imprudence of both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that the King had lately
directed a letter to the Bishops to order their clergy to preach against
that sin, swearing, etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in
execution without any indulgence.I went to Kensington, which King William had bought
of Lord Nottingham, and altered, but was yet a patched building, but
with the garden, however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had
been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane.Among other
discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed
by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding
advantage we of this nation had by being the first who built frigates,
the first of which ever built was that vessel which was afterward called
"The Constant Warwick," and was the work of Pett of Chatham, for a trial
of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks,
the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing,
that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended,
taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that
more such being built, did in a year or two scour the Channel from those
of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it.He added that
it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the
sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of
building huge great ships and second and third rates, they would leave
off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify
gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations,
and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons
were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being
capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and
inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those
so otherwise useful swift frigates.These being to encounter the
greatest ships would be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those
who should manage the fire ships, and the Prince who should first store
himself with numbers of such fire ships, would, through the help and
countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such
vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those
light, swift ships to guard the fire ships.He concluded there would
shortly be no other method of seafight; and that great ships and
men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who
should encounter them with far less number.He represented to us the
dreadful effect of these fire ships; that he continually observed in our
late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire ship
approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such
consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of
the guns, bombs, etc., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and
astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about,
forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every one looking about to
see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be
drowned if they did so.This he said was likely to prove hereafter the
method of seafight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they
continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on
account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th March, 1690.Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum,
on Heb.13, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and
that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very
small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made
this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was
done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as
action.This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we
ought to live and behave ourselves before such an all-seeing Deity; and
how we were to conceive of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the
nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and
therefore it was that in Scripture we attribute those actions and
affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any
proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance
of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, "God will
remember the sins of the penitent no more:" not as if God could forget
anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with
the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland),
against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books,
but now most friendly reconciled.[73] He related to us many particulars
of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the inveterate hatred
which the Presbyterians show to the family of the Stuarts, and the
exceeding tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on earth,
in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the
right of government; their implacable hatred to the Episcopal Order and
Church of England.He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents from
our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the 20 of
Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among them feigning himself a
Protestant, and who was the first who began to pray extempore, and
brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of,
praying by the Spirit.This Jesuit remained many years before he was
discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he was buried at...
having yet on his monument, "_Rosa inter spinas_."[Footnote 73: Sir George, as we have seen, had written in praise of
    a Private Life, which Mr.Evelyn answered by a book in praise of
    Public Life and Active Employment.]Charlton's curiosities, both
of art and nature, and his full and rare collection of medals, which
taken altogether, in all kinds, is doubtless one of the most perfect
assemblages of rarities that can be any where seen.I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed, large, and
intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was wonderful to consider.King William set forth on his Irish expedition, leaving
the Queen Regent.Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, showing with
what malice and injustice he was suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about
the timber, of which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of
Parliament, with the exceeding danger which the fleet would shortly be
in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed
the Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
state, and showed his great ability.Asaph; his
conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near
destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up
to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased
God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in
their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and
Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into
the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures
with, and afterward declared for, them.He then invited these poor
people from their dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of
their religion, and begged pardon for the ill usage they had received,
charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it.These
being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of
St.Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses spoken of in the
Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was
looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should
persuade two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with L20 toward their journey, at that very
time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring
them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should
be returned safely to their country before they arrived.This happening
contrary to all expectation and appearance, did exceedingly credit the
Bishop's confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to
pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years
before.Boyle and Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explained the necessity of it so fully, and so learnedly made
out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom
of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till thirty years, when
Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly
reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should
obtain through all the world.Mede, and
other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning
the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present
calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St.John all
along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.Pepys, who the next day was sent to the
Gatehouse,[74] and several great persons to the Tower, on suspicion of
being affected to King James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the
Queen's uncle.King William having vanquished King James in Ireland,
there was much public rejoicing.It seems the Irish in King James's army
would not stand, but the English-Irish and French made great resistance.Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry.King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a
cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little
interruption of his pursuit.Hamilton, who broke his word about
Tyrconnel, was taken.It is reported that King James is gone back to
France.Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William be
returning, we may say of him as Caesar said, "_Veni, vidi, vici_."But to
alloy much of this, the French fleet rides in our channel, ours not
daring to interpose, and the enemy threatening to land.[Footnote 74: Poor Pepys, as the reader knows, had already undergone
    an imprisonment, with perhaps just as much reason as the present, on
    the absurd accusation of having sent information to the French Court
    of the state of the English Navy.][Sidenote: LONDON]

27th June, 1690.I went to visit some friends in the Tower, when asking
for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake directed me to the Earl of
Torrington, who about three days before had been sent for from the
fleet, and put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the French
fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders, while
Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters of the sea, threatening a
descent.This afternoon a camp of about 4,000 men was begun to
be formed on Blackheath.Pepys, now suffered to return to his
house, on account of indisposition.The Duke of Grafton came to visit me, going to his
ship at the mouth of the river, in his way to Ireland (where he was
slain).The French landed some soldiers at Teignmouth, in
Devon, and burned some poor houses.The French fleet still hovering
about the western coast, and we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships
in the bay of Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under three
admirals.The country in the west all on their guard.A very
extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th was a very great storm of
thunder and lightning, and on the 15th the season much changed to wet
and cold.The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which were up
through England, were dismissed.The French King having news that King
William was slain, and his army defeated in Ireland, caused such a
triumph at Paris, and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in
the midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished, by a speedy
flight and escape, himself brought the news of his own defeat.I was desired to be one of the bail of the Earl of
Clarendon, for his release from the Tower, with divers noblemen.Asaph expounds his prophecies to me and Mr.The troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth.That sweet and hopeful
youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds he received in the fight of
the Boyne, to the great sorrow of all his friends, being (I think) the
last male of that family, to which my wife is related.A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his age, having had the
advantage of the choicest breeding abroad, both as to arts and arms; he
had traveled much, but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his
unfortunate King.The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening, the naval
expedition is hindered, and the extremity of wet causes the siege of
Limerick to be raised, King William returned to England.Lord Sidney
left Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near three parts
[in four].An extraordinary sharp, cold, east
wind.The French General, with Tyrconnel and their
forces, gone back to France, beaten out by King William.The Duke of Grafton was there mortally wounded and dies.The 8th of this month Lord Spencer wrote me
word from Althorpe, that there happened an earthquake the day before in
the morning, which, though short, sensibly shook the house.The
"Gazette" acquainted us that the like happened at the same time,
half-past seven, at Barnstaple, Holyhead, and Dublin.We were not
sensible of it here.Kinsale at last surrendered, meantime King James's
party burn all the houses they have in their power, and among them that
stately palace of Lord Ossory's, which lately cost, as reported,
L40,000.By a disastrous accident, a third-rate ship, the Breda, blew up
and destroyed all on board; in it were twenty-five prisoners of war.She
was to have sailed for England the next day.Went to the Countess of Clancarty, to condole with
her concerning her debauched and dissolute son, who had done so much
mischief in Ireland, now taken and brought prisoner to the Tower.Exceeding great storms, yet a warm season.Pepys's memorials to Lord Godolphin, now
resuming the commission of the Treasury, to the wonder of all his
friends.Having been chosen President of the Royal Society, I
desired to decline it, and with great difficulty devolved the election
on Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.Hough, President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who was displaced with several of the Fellows for not taking the oath
imposed by King James, now made a Bishop.Most of this month cold and
frost.One Johnson, a Knight, was executed at Tyburn for being an
accomplice with Campbell, brother to Lord Argyle, in stealing a young
heiress.This week a PLOT was discovered for a general
rising against the new Government, for which (Henry) Lord Clarendon and
others were sent to the Tower.The next day, I went to see Lord
Clarendon.Trial of Lord Preston, as not
being an English Peer, hastened at the Old Bailey.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th January, 1691.Lord Preston condemned about a design to bring in
King James by the French.I went to visit Monsieur Justell and the Library at
St.James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS.(which were in
good number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many
years.Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good
pictures.After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute.Sir
William had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much
expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat
at Easton, near Towcester.[75]

    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the
    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow
    of Thomas, the first Earl.]Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a
letter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit
Lord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1691.This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all
the buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,
beginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had
been pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),
and consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both
King Charles II.The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happened--Proclamation against the <DW7>s, etc.Sloane's curiosities, being an
universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting
of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and
insects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,
and one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of
grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc.This
collection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural
discourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,
sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.[Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British
    Museum.]The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the
oaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from
Chichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now
come to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]
yet at Lambeth.I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,
especially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or
divine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr.Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his
advice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he
believed he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says
the Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "_Nolo_," and say it from the
heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be
done in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate.What he will do I
know not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead
their interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty
in their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as
wise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against
their consciences.I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said
that he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house
altogether disfurnished and his books packed up.I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and
his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was
performed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the
afternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there.I was the
chief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard
Onslow, Mr.Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr.Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew.He was laid in the
vault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family.A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th June, 1691.I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the
Tower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.Cumberland, the
new Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr.Lloyd having been put out for not
acknowledging the Government.Cumberland is a very learned, excellent
man.Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the
Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep
possession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was
dispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned.This stout demeanor of the
few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a
great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though
those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people
never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not
heretics.The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty
of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave
no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,
there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure
of that order in the Church.I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the
Tower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's
permission, under the care of his warden.Cumberland was made Bishop of
    Peterborough and Dr.Lloyd in the see of
    Norwich.]Stringfellow preach his first
sermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to
which I did recommend him to Dr.Tenison for the constant preacher and
lecturer.This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by
King James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr.Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious
man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the
Doctor.I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person.Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he
was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood having become
so populous.Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister,
and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,

19th July, 1691.Tenison preached the first sermon,
taking his text from Psalm xxvi."Lord, I have loved the habitation
of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth."In concluding,
he gave that this should be made a parish church so soon as the
Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in honor of
the three undivided persons in the Deity; and he minded them to attend
to that faith of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us.Stringfellow
preached on Luke vii."The centurion who had built a synagogue."He
proceeded to the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person of the generous
centurion, as was comprehensive of all the virtues of an accomplished
Christian, in a style so full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard
a sermon more apposite to the occasion.He modestly insinuated the
obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter
of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the
advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches,
hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful
books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so
exemplary for his benefaction to that place.Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library [in
St.Martin's]; and set up two or three free schools at his own charges.Besides this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains in
constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself to promote the
service of God both in public and private.I never knew a man of a more
universal and generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.The great victory of King William's army in Ireland was looked on as
decisive of that war.Ruth, who had been so
cruel to the poor Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the
best commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed, but of the
enemy 4,000 or 5,000.An extraordinary hot season, yet refreshed by some
thundershowers.No sermon in the church in the afternoon, and the
curacy ill-served.A sermon by the curate; an honest discourse, but read
without any spirit, or seeming concern; a great fault in the education
of young preachers.Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the
rain and wind very violent.Our fleet come in to lay up the great ships;
nothing done at sea, pretending that we cannot meet the French.A great storm at sea; we lost the "Coronation" and
"Harwich," above 600 men perishing.Our navy come in without
having performed anything, yet there has been great loss of ships by
negligence, and unskillful men governing the fleet and Navy board.I visited the Earl of Dover, who having made his
peace with the King, was now come home.The relation he gave of the
strength of the French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was very wide from
what we fancied.8th to 30th November, 1691.An extraordinary dry and warm season,
without frost, and like a new spring; such as had not been known for
many years.Part of the King's house at Kensington was burned.Discourse of another PLOT, in which several great
persons were named, but believed to be a sham.--A proposal in the House
of Commons that every officer in the whole nation who received a salary
above L500 or otherwise by virtue of his office, should contribute it
wholly to the support of the war with France, and this upon their oath.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a
daughter.An exceedingly dry and calm winter; no rain for
many past months.Dined at Lambeth with the new Archbishop.Saw the
effect of my greenhouse furnace, set up by the Archbishop's son-in-law.Charlton's collection of spiders,
birds, scorpions, and other serpents, etc.This last week died that pious, admirable
Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy friend, Mr.Boyle, aged
about 65,--a great loss to all that knew him, and to the public.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th January, 1692.Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached on Eccles.He concluded
with an eulogy due to the deceased, who made God and religion the scope
of all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and who had
arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied with such zeal and
extraordinary piety, which he showed in the whole course of his life,
particularly in his exemplary charity on all occasions,--that he gave
L1,000 yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland; was at
the charge of translating the Scriptures into the Irish and Indian
tongues, and was now promoting a Turkish translation, as he had formerly
done of Grotius "on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries; that he had
settled a fund for preachers who should preach expressly against
Atheists, Libertines, Socinians, and Jews; that he had in his will given
L8,000 to charitable uses; but that his private charities were
extraordinary.He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek, his
reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology, once
deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and that at the time of
restoration of King Charles II., when he might have made a great figure
in the nation as to secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able
to discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline that, and
his humility the other.He spoke of his civility to strangers, the great
good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to
what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life he led, and
the happy end he made.Something was touched of his sister, the Lady
Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him.And truly all this was but
his due, without any grain of flattery.This week a most execrable murder was committed on Dr.Clench, father of
that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed.Under
pretense of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him
in it; and, sending away the coachman under some pretense, they left his
dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.Tenison, now
Bishop of Lincoln, in Trinity Church, being the first that was
christened there.A frosty and dry season continued; many persons die
of apoplexy, more than usual.Lord Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of
the King's army in England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive taking of
bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions from his inferior
officers.Note, this was the Lord who was entirely advanced by King
James, and was the first who betrayed and forsook his master.He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.Boyle having made me one of the trustees for
his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting of the Bishop of Lincoln,
Sir Rob.... wood, and serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the
will which related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing and
electing a minister to preach one sermon the first Sunday in the month,
during the four summer months, expressly against Atheists, Deists,
Libertines, Jews, etc., without descending to any other controversy
whatever, for which L50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to a new election
of some other able divine, or to continue the same, as the trustees
should judge convenient.Bentley, chaplain to
the Bishop of Worcester (Dr.The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St.Martin's; the second
Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so alternately.Lord Marlborough having used words against the
King, and been discharged from all his great places, his wife was
forbidden the Court, and the Princess of Denmark was desired by the
Queen to dismiss her from her service; but she refusing to do so, goes
away from Court to Sion house.Divers new Lords made: Sir Henry Capel,
Sir William Fermor, etc.The
Parliament adjourned, not well satisfied with affairs.The business of
the East India Company, which they would have reformed, let fall.The
Duke of Norfolk does not succeed in his endeavor to be divorced.[78]

    [Footnote 78: See _post_ pp.My son was made one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to which employment he had a mind, far
from my wishes.I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me the
picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of France, seeming in
my opinion very much to resemble the Queen his mother, and of a most
vivacious countenance.The Queen Dowager went out of
England toward Portugal, as pretended, against the advice of all her
friends.So excellent a discourse against the Epicurean system is
not to be recapitulated in a few words.He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything in it which I
desired to be altered.I took this as a civility, and earnestly desired
it should be printed, as one of the most learned and convincing
discourses I had ever heard.King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising.Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister.Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692.Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet.Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us.Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland.After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland.We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away.An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained.George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den.Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr.Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr.Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit.Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr.Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe.It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret.I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable.Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.Lancaster, the new Vicar of St.A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London.They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses.They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr.Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr.Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself.We intended to take him in again the
next year.[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93.Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on

named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than

day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

old saying, 'Curses, like chickens, still come home to roost.'Your
cursing won't hurt me any.""If my curses don't my fists may!"retorted Bill, with a malignant look."You won't have a chance to carry out your threats for some years to
come, if you get your deserts," said Jack, by no means terrified."I've
only done my duty, and I'm ready to do it again whenever needed."By this time the safe was open; all present saw the envelope of money
labeled "$12,000."The two burglars saw the prize which was to have rewarded their efforts
and risk with a tantalizing sense of defeat.They had been so near
success, only to be foiled at last, and consigned to a jail for a term
of years.muttered Bill, bitterly, and in his heart Mike said
amen."Gentlemen, I will count this money before you," said the janitor, as he
opened the parcel.It resulted, as my readers already
know, in the discovery that, in place of twelve thousand, the parcel
contained but one thousand dollars."Gentlemen, will you take
notice of this?Of course it is clear where the rest is gone--Talbot
carried it away with him.""By this time he is in custody," said Jack."Look here, old man, who engineered this thing?""Come here, Dan," said Jack, summoning our hero, who modestly stood in
the background.Burglar, this boy is entitled to the credit of
defeating you.We should have known nothing of your intentions but for
Dan, the Detective.""Why, I could crush him with one hand.""Force is a good thing, but brains are better," said Jack."Dan here has
got a better head-piece than any of us.""You've done yourself credit, boy," said the chief policeman."When I
have a difficult case I'll send for you.""You are giving me more credit than I deserve," said Dan, modestly."If I ever get out of jail, I'll remember you," said Bill, scowling."I
wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a man, but to be laid by the
heels by a boy like you--that's enough to make me sick.""You've said enough, my man," said the policeman who had him in charge.The two prisoners, escorted by their captors, made their unwilling way
to the station-house.They were duly tried, and were sentenced to a ten
years' term of imprisonment.As for Talbot, he tried to have it believed that he took the money found
on him because he distrusted the honesty of the janitor; but this
statement fell to the ground before Dan's testimony and that of Bill's
wife.He, too, received a heavy sentence, and it was felt that he only got his
just deserts.*       *       *       *       *       *       *

On the morning after the events recorded above, Mr.Rogers called Dan
into the counting-room."Dan," he said, "I wish to express to you my personal obligations for
the admirable manner in which you have managed the affair of this
burglary.""I am convinced that but for you I should have lost twelve thousand
dollars.It would not have ruined me, to be sure, but it would have been
a heavy loss.""Such a loss as that would have ruined me," said Dan, smiling."So I should suppose," assented his employer."I predict, however, that
the time will come when you can stand such a loss, and have something
left.""As there must always be a beginning, suppose you begin with that."Rogers had turned to his desk and written a check, which he handed
to Dan.This was the way it read:


     No.Pay to Dan Mordaunt or order One Thousand Dollars.Dan took the check, supposing it might be for twenty dollars or so.When
he saw the amount, he started in excitement and incredulity."It is a large sum for a boy like you,
Dan."But, sir, you don't mean all this for me?"It is less than ten per cent on the money you have saved
for us.""How can I thank you for your kindness, sir?"By the way, what wages do we pay
you?""It is a little better than selling papers in front of the Astor House,
isn't it, Dan?"Now, Dan, let me give you two
pieces of advice.""First, put this money in a good savings-bank, and don't draw upon it
unless you are obliged to."And next, spend a part of your earnings in improving your education.You have already had unusual advantages for a boy of your age, but you
should still be learning.It may help you, in a business point of view,
to understand book-keeping."Dan not only did this, but resumed the study of both French and German,
of which he had some elementary knowledge, and advanced rapidly in all.Punctually every month Dan received a remittance of sixty dollars
through a foreign banker, whose office was near Wall street.Of this sum it may be remembered that ten dollars were to be
appropriated to Althea's dress.Of the little girl it may be said she was very happy in her new home.Mordaunt, whom she called mamma,
while she always looked forward with delight to Dan's return at night.Mordaunt was very happy in the child's companionship, and found the
task of teaching her very congenial.But for the little girl she would have had many lonely hours, since Dan
was absent all day on business."I don't know what I shall do, Althea, when you go to school," she said
one day."I don't want to go to school.Let me stay at home with you, mamma.""For the present I can teach you, my dear, but the time will come when
for your own good it will be better to go to school.I cannot teach you
as well as the teachers you will find there.""You know ever so much, mamma."Compared with you, my dear, I seem to know a great deal, but there are
others who know much more."Althea was too young as yet, however, to attend school, and the happy
home life continued.Mordaunt and Dan often wondered how long their mysterious ward was
to remain with them.If so, how could that
mother voluntarily forego her child's society?These were questions they sometimes asked themselves, but no answer
suggested itself.They were content to have them remain unanswered, so
long as Althea might remain with them.The increase of Dan's income, and the large sum he had on interest,
would have enabled them to live comfortably even without the provision
made for their young ward.Dan felt himself justified in indulging
in a little extravagance."Mother," said he, one evening, "I am thinking of taking a course of
lessons in dancing.""What has put that into your head, Dan?""Julia Rogers is to have a birthday party in two or three months, and I
think from a hint her father dropped to-day I shall have an invitation.I shall feel awkward if I don't know how to dance."Tom Carver will be sure to be there, and if I don't dance, or if I am
awkward, he will be sure to sneer at me.""Will that make you feel bad, Dan?""Not exactly, but I don't want to appear at disadvantage when he is
around.If I have been a newsboy, I want to show that I can take the
part of gentleman as well as he.""Does the ability to dance make a gentleman, Dan?""No, mother, but I should feel awkward without it.I don't want to be a
wall-flower.What do you say to my plan, mother?""Carry it out by all means, Dan.There is no reason why you shouldn't
hold up your head with any of them," and Mrs.Mordaunt's eyes rested
with pride on the handsome face and manly expression of her son."You are a little prejudiced in my favor, mother," said Dan, smiling."If I were as awkward as a cat in a strange garret, you wouldn't see
it."He selected a
fashionable teacher, although the price was high, for he thought it
might secure him desirable acquaintances, purchased a handsome suit of
clothes, and soon became very much interested in the lessons.He had a
quick ear, a good figure, and a natural grace of movement, which soon
made him noticeable in the class, and he was quite in demand among the
young ladies as a partner.He was no less a favorite socially, being agreeable as well as
good-looking.Mordaunt," said the professor, "I wish all my scholars did me as
much credit as you do."Thank you, sir," said Dan, modestly, but he felt gratified.By the time the invitation came Dan had no fears as to acquitting
himself creditably."I hope Tom Carver will be there," he said to his mother, as he was
dressing for the party.Rogers lived in a handsome brown-stone-front house up town.As Dan approached, he saw the entire house brilliantly lighted.He
passed beneath a canopy, over carpeted steps, to the front door, and
rang the bell.The door was opened by a stylish-looking <DW52> man, whose grand air
showed that he felt the importance and dignity of his position.As Dan passed in he said:

"Gentlemen's dressing-room third floor back."With a single glance through the open door at the lighted parlors, where
several guests were already assembled, Dan followed directions, and went
up stairs.Entering the dressing-room, he saw a boy carefully arranging his hair
before the glass."That's my friend, Tom Carver," said Dan to himself.Tom was so busily engaged at his toilet that he didn't at once look at
the new guest.When he had leisure to look up, he seemed surprised, and
remarked, superciliously:

"I didn't expect to see _you_ here.""Are you engaged to look after this room?"With all my heart, if you'll brush me," answered Dan, partly offended
and partly amused."Our positions are rather different, I think."You are a guest of Miss Rogers, and so am I.""You don't mean to say that you are going down into the parlor?""A boy who sells papers in front of the Astor House is not a suitable
guest at a fashionable party.""That is not your affair," said Dan, coldly."But it is not true that I
sell papers anywhere.""And I will again, if necessary," answered Dan, as he took Tom's place
in front of the glass and began to arrange his toilet.Then, for the first time, Tom took notice that Dan was dressed as well
as himself, in a style with which the most captious critic could not
find fault.He would have liked
to see Dan in awkward, ill-fitting, or shabby clothes.It seemed to him
that an ex-newsboy had no right to dress so well, and he was greatly
puzzled to understand how he could afford it."It is not remarkable that I should be well dressed."So can I," answered Dan, laconically."Do you mean to say that you bought that suit and paid for it?""You are very kind to take so much interest in me.It may relieve your
mind to see this."Dan took a roll of bills from his pocket, and displayed them to the
astonished Tom."I don't see where you got so much money," said Tom, mystified."I've got more in the bank," said Dan."I mention it to you that you
needn't feel bad about my extravagance in buying a party suit.""I wouldn't have come to this party if I had been you," said Tom,
changing his tone."You'll be so awkward, you know.You don't know any one except Miss
Rogers, who, of course, invited you out of pity, not expecting you would
accept.""You forget I know you," said Dan, smiling again."I beg you won't presume upon our former slight acquaintance," said Tom,
hastily."I shall be so busily occupied that I really can't give you any
attention.""Then I must shift for myself, I suppose," said Dan, good-humoredly."Go first, if you like," said Tom, superciliously."He doesn't want to go down with me," thought Dan."Perhaps I shall
surprise him a little;" and he made his way down stairs.As Dan entered the parlors he saw the young lady in whose honor the
party was given only a few feet distant.He advanced with perfect ease, and paid his respects."I am very glad to see you here this evening, Mr.Mordaunt," said Julia,
cordially."I had no idea he would look
so well."Mentally she pronounced him the handsomest young gentleman present."Take your partners for a quadrille, young gentlemen," announced the
master of ceremonies."Not as yet," answered the young lady, smiling.So it happened that as Tom Carver entered the room, he beheld, to his
intense surprise and disgust, Dan leading the young hostess to her place
in the quadrille."I suppose he
never attempted to dance in his life.It will be fun to watch his
awkwardness.I am very much surprised that Julia should condescend to
dance with him--a common newsboy."At first Tom thought he wouldn't dance, but Mrs.Rogers approaching
said:

"Tom, there's Jane Sheldon.Accordingly Tom found himself leading up a little girl of eight.There was no place except in the quadrille in which Dan and Julia Rogers
were to dance.Tom found himself one of the "sides.""Good-evening, Julia," he said, catching the eye of Miss Rogers."I am too late to be your partner.""Yes, but you see I am not left a wall-flower," said the young lady,
smiling.Mordaunt kindly relieved me of that apprehension.""You are fortunate," said Tom, sneering."I leave my partner to thank you for that compliment," said Julia,
determined not to gratify Tom by appearing to understand the sneer."There's no occasion," said Tom, rudely."I am glad of it," said Dan, "for I am so unused to compliments that I
am afraid I should answer awkwardly.""I can very well believe that," returned Tom, significantly.She looked offended rather for she felt that
rudeness to her partner reflected upon herself.But here the music struck up, and the quadrille began."Now for awkwardness," said Tom to himself, and he watched Dan closely.But, to his surprise, nothing could be neater or better modulated than
Dan's movements.Instead of hopping about, as Tom thought he would, he
was thoroughly graceful."Where could the fellow have learned to dance?"he asked himself, in
disappointment.Julia was gratified; for, to tell the truth, she too had not been
altogether without misgivings on the subject of Dan's dancing, and,
being herself an excellent dancer, she would have found it a little
disagreeable if Dan had proved awkward.The quadrille proceeded, and Tom was chagrined that the newsboy, as he
mentally termed Dan, had proved a better dancer than himself."Oh, well, it's easy to dance in a quadrille," he said to himself, by
way of consolation."He won't venture on any of the round dances."But as Dan was leading Julia to her seat he asked her hand in the next
polka, and was graciously accepted.He then bowed and left her, knowing that he ought not to monopolize the
young hostess.Although Tom had told Dan not to expect any attentions from him, he was
led by curiosity to accost our hero."It seems that newsboys dance," said he."But it was not in very good taste for you to engage Miss Rogers for the
first dance.""Somebody had to be prominent, or Miss Rogers would have been left to
dance by herself.""There are others who would have made more suitable partners for her.""I am sorry to have stood in your way."I shall have plenty of opportunities of dancing
with her, and you won't.I suppose she took pity on you, as you know no
other young lady here."Just then a pretty girl, beautifully dressed, approached Dan.Mordaunt," she said, offering her hand with a beaming
smile."Good-evening, Miss Carroll," said Dan.In a minute Dan was whirling round the room with the young lady, greatly
to Tom's amazement, for Edith Carroll was from a family of high social
standing, living on Murray Hill."How in the duse does Dan Mordaunt know that girl?"To Tom's further disappointment Dan danced as gracefully in the galop as
in the quadrille.When the galop was over, Dan promenaded with another young lady, whose
acquaintance he had made at dancing-school, and altogether seemed as
much at his ease as if he had been attending parties all his life.Tom managed to obtain Edith Carroll as a partner."I didn't know you were acquainted with Dan Mordaunt," he said."Oh, yes, I know him very well.Why I think he dances _beautifully_,
and so do all the girls.""How do the girls know how he dances?""Why he goes to our dancing-school.The professor says he is his best
pupil."That's fortunate for him," said Tom, with a sneer."Perhaps he may
become a dancing-master in time.""He would make a good one, but I don't think he's very likely to do
that.""It would be a good thing for him.He is as well-dressed as any
young gentleman here."This was true, and Tom resented it.He felt that Dan had no right to
dress well."He ought not to spend so much money on dress when he has his mother to
support," he said, provoked."It seems to me you take a great deal of interest in Mr.Mordaunt," said
the young beauty, pointedly."Oh, no; he can do as he likes for all me, but, of course, when a boy
in his position dresses as if he were rich one can't help noticing it.""I am sure he can't be very poor, or he could not attend Dodworth's
dancing-school.At any rate I like to dance with him, and I don't care
whether he's poor or rich."Presently Tom saw Dan dancing the polka with Julia Rogers, and with the
same grace that he had exhibited in the other dances.He felt jealous, for he fancied himself a favorite with Julia, because
their families being intimate, he saw a good deal of her.On the whole Tom was not enjoying the party.He did succeed, however, in
obtaining the privilege of escorting Julia to supper.Just in front of him was Dan, escorting a young lady from Fifth avenue.Mordaunt appears to be enjoying himself," said Julia Rogers."Yes, he has plenty of cheek," muttered Tom."Excuse me, Tom, but do you think such expressions suitable for such an
occasion as this?""I am sorry you don't like it, but I never saw a more forward or
presuming fellow than this Dan Mordaunt.""I beg you to keep your opinion to yourself," said Julia Rogers, with
dignity."I find he is a great favorite with all the young ladies here.I had no idea he knew so many of them."It seemed to him that all the girls were infatuated with
a common newsboy, while his vanity was hurt by finding himself quite
distanced in the race.About twelve o'clock the two boys met in the dressing-room."You seemed to enjoy yourself," said Tom, coldly."Yes, thanks to your kind attentions," answered Dan, with a smile."It
is pleasant to meet old friends, you know.By the way, I suppose we
shall meet at Miss Carroll's party.""So the young lady tells me," answered Dan, smiling."I suppose _you'll_ be giving a fashionable party next," said Tom, with
a sneer.But Dan's dreams were by no means sweet that night.When he reached home, it was to hear of a great and startling
misfortune.At half-past twelve Dan ascended the stairs to his mother's room.He had
promised to come in and tell her how he had enjoyed himself at the
party.He was in excellent spirits on account of the flattering
attentions he had received.It was in this frame of mind that he opened
the door.What was his surprise, even consternation, when his mother
advanced to meet him with tearful eyes and an expression of distress."Oh, Dan, I am so glad you have got home!""I am quite well, Dan; but Althea----"

And Mrs.You don't mean she is----"

He couldn't finish the sentence, but his mother divined what he meant.she said, "but she has disappeared--she has been
stolen."Mordaunt told what she knew, but that related only to the
particulars of the abduction.We are in a position to tell the reader
more, but it will be necessary to go back for a month, and transfer the
scene to another continent.In a spacious and handsomely furnished apartment at the West End of
London sat the lady who had placed Althea in charge of the Mordaunts.She was deep in thought, and that not of an agreeable nature."I fear," she said to herself, "that trouble awaits me.John Hartley,
whom I supposed to be in California, is certainly in London.I cannot be
mistaken in his face, and I certainly saw him in Hyde Park to-day.I don't know, but I fear he did.If so, he will not long
delay in making his appearance.Then I shall be persecuted, but I must
be firm.He shall not learn through me where Althea is.He is her
father, it is true, but he has forfeited all claim to her guardianship.A confirmed gambler and drunkard, he would soon waste her fortune,
bequeathed her by her poor mother.He can have no possible claim to it;
for, apart from his having had no hand in leaving it to her, he was
divorced from my poor sister before her death."At this point there was a knock at the door of the room.There entered a young servant-maid, who courtesied, and said:

"Mrs.Vernon, there is a gentleman who wishes to see you.""Yes, mum; he said his name was Bancroft."I know no one of that name," mused the lady."Well, Margaret,
you may show him up, and you may remain in the anteroom within call."Her eyes were fixed upon the door with natural curiosity, when her
visitor entered.Instantly her face flushed, and her eyes sparkled with anger."I see you know me, Harriet Vernon," he said."It is some time since we
met, is it not?I am charmed, I am sure, to see my sister-in-law looking
so well."He sank into a chair without waiting for an invitation."When did you change your name to Bancroft?"demanded the lady,
abruptly."Oh," he said, showing his teeth, "that was a little ruse.I feared you
would have no welcome for John Hartley, notwithstanding our near
relationship, and I was forced to sail under false colors.""It was quite in character," said Mrs.Vernon, coldly; "you were always
false.The slender tie that
connected us was broken when my sister obtained a divorce from you.""You think so, my lady," said the visitor, dropping his tone of mocking
badinage, and regarding her in a menacing manner, "but you were never
more mistaken.You may flatter yourself that you are rid of me, but you
flatter yourself in vain.""Do you come here to threaten me, John Hartley?""I come here to ask for my child."Where you cannot get at her," answered Mrs."Don't think to put me off in that way," he said, fiercely."Don't think to terrify me, John Hartley," said the lady,
contemptuously."I am not so easily alarmed as your poor wife."Hartley looked at her as if he would have assaulted her had he dared,
but she knew very well that he did not dare.He was a bully, but he was
a coward."You refuse, then, to tell me what you have done with my child?"A father has some rights, and the law will not permit
his child to be kept from him.""Does your anxiety to see Althea arise from parental affection?"she
asked, in a sarcastic tone.I have a right to the custody of my
child.""I suppose you have a right to waste her fortune also at the
gaming-table.""I have a right to act as my child's guardian," he retorted."Why should you not, John Hartley?You
ill-treated and abused her mother.Fortunately, she escaped from you before it was all gone.But you
shortened her life, and she did not long survive the separation.It was
her last request that I should care for her child--that I should, above
all, keep her out of your clutches.I made that promise, and I mean to
keep it.""You poisoned my wife's mind against me," he said."But for your cursed
interference we should never have separated.""You are right, perhaps, in your last statement.I certainly did urge my
sister to leave you.I obtained her consent to the application for a
divorce, but as to poisoning her mind against you, there was no need of
that.By your conduct and your treatment you destroyed her love and
forfeited her respect, and she saw the propriety of the course which I
recommended.""I didn't come here to be lectured.You can spare your invectives,
Harriet Vernon.I was not a model husband,
perhaps, but I was as good as the average.""If that is the case, Heaven help the woman who marries!""Or the man that marries a woman like you!""You are welcome to your opinion of me.I am entirely indifferent to
your good or bad opinion."I don't recognize your right to question me on this subject, but I
will answer you.He appeared to be occupied with
some thought.When he spoke it was in a more conciliatory tone."I don't doubt that she is in good hands," he said."I am sure you will
treat her kindly.Perhaps you are a better guardian than I. I am willing
to leave her in your hands, but I ought to have some compensation.""Althea has a hundred thousand dollars, yielding at least five thousand
dollars income.Probably her expenses are little more than one-tenth of
this sum.Give me half her income--say
three thousand dollars annually--and I will give you and her no further
trouble.""I thought that was the object of your visit," said Mrs."I was right in giving you no credit for parental affection.In regard
to your proposition, I cannot entertain it.You had one half of my
sister's fortune, and you spent it.You have no further claim on her
money.""Then I swear to you that I will be even with you.I will find the
child, and when I do you shall never see her again.""Margaret," she said, coldly, "will you show this gentleman out?""You are certainly very polite, Harriet Vernon," he said."You are bold,
too, for you are defying me, and that is dangerous.You had better
reconsider your determination, before it is too late.""It will never be too late; I can at any time buy you off," she said,
contemptuously."We shall see," he hissed, eying her malignantly.Vernon, when her visitor had been shown out,
"never admit that person again; I am always out to him.""I wonder who 'twas," she thought, curiously.John Hartley, when a young man, had wooed and won Althea's mother.Julia
Belmont was a beautiful and accomplished girl, an heiress in her own
right, and might have made her choice among at least a dozen suitors.That she should have accepted the hand of John Hartley, a banker's
clerk, reputed "fast," was surprising, but a woman's taste in such a
case is often hard to explain or justify.Vernon--strenuously objected to the match, and by so doing gained the
hatred of her future brother-in-law.Opposition proved ineffectual, and
Julia Belmont became Mrs.Her fortune amounted to two hundred
thousand dollars.The trustee and her sister succeeded in obtaining her
consent that half of this sum should be settled on herself, and her
issue, should she have any.John Hartley resigned his position
immediately after marriage, and declined to enter upon any business."Julia and I have enough to live upon.If I am
out of business I can devote myself more entirely to her."This reasoning satisfied his young wife, and for a time all went well.But Hartley joined a fashionable club, formed a taste for gambling,
indulged in copious libations, not unfrequently staggering home drunk,
to the acute sorrow of his wife, and then excesses soon led to
ill-treatment.The money, which he could spend in a few years, melted
away, and he tried to gain possession of the remainder of his wife's
property.But, meanwhile, Althea was born, and a consideration for her
child's welfare strengthened the wife in her firm refusal to accede to
this unreasonable demand."You shall have the income, John," she said--"I will keep none back; but
the principal must be kept for Althea.""You care more for the brat than you do for me," he muttered."I care for you both," she answered."You know how the money would go,
John."That meddling sister of yours has put you up to this," he said,
angrily.It is right, and I have decided for myself.""I feel that in refusing I am doing my duty by you.""It is a strange way--to oppose your husband's wishes.Women ought never
to be trusted with money--they don't know how to take care of it.""You are not the person to say this, John.In five years you have wasted
one hundred thousand dollars.""It was bad luck in investments," he replied.Investing money at the gaming-table is not
very profitable.""Do you mean to insult me, madam?""I am only telling the sad truth, John."She withdrew, flushed and indignant, for she had spirit enough to resent
this outrage, and he left the house in a furious rage.When Hartley found that there was no hope of carrying his point, all
restraint seemed removed.He plunged into worse excesses, and his
treatment became so bad that Mrs.Hartley consented to institute
proceedings for divorce.It was granted, and the child was given to her.When he returned his wife had died of
pneumonia, and her sister--Mrs.Vernon, now a widow--had assumed the
care of Althea.An attempt to gain possession of the child induced her
to find another guardian for the child.This was the way Althea had
come into the family of our young hero.Thus much, that the reader may understand the position of affairs, and
follow intelligently the future course of the story.When John Hartley left the presence of his sister-in-law, he muttered
maledictions upon her."I'll have the child yet, if only to spite her," he muttered, between
his teeth."I won't allow a jade to stand between me and my own flesh
and blood.I must think of some plan to circumvent her."He had absolutely no clew, and little money to assist
him in his quest.But Fortune, which does not always favor the brave,
but often helps the undeserving, came unexpectedly to his help.At an American banker's he ran across an old acquaintance--one who had
belonged to the same club as himself in years past."What are you doing here, Hartley?"By the way, I was reminded of you not long since.""I saw your child in Union Square, in New York.""Are you sure it was my
child?""Of course; I used to see it often, you know."Don't _you_ know where she lives?""No; her aunt is keeping the child from me.She was with a middle-aged lady, who evidently
was suspicious of me, for she did not bring out the child but once more,
and was clearly anxious when I took notice of her.""She was acting according to instructions, no doubt.""So do I. Why do they keep _you_ away from her?""Because she has money, and they wish to keep it in their hands," said
Hartley, plausibly.She is living
here in London, doubtless on my little girl's fortune."John Hartley knew that this was not true, for Mrs.Vernon was a rich
woman; but it suited his purpose to say so, and the statement was
believed by his acquaintance."This is bad treatment, Hartley," he said, in a tone of sympathy."What are you going to do about it?""Try to find out where the child is placed, and get possession of her."This information John Hartley felt to be of value.It narrowed his
search, and made success much less difficult.In order to obtain more definite information, he lay in wait for Mrs.Margaret at first repulsed him, but a sovereign judiciously slipped into
her hand convinced her that Hartley was quite the gentleman, and he had
no difficulty, by the promise of a future douceur, in obtaining her
co-operation."If it's no harm you mean my
missus----"

"Certainly not, but she is keeping my child from me.You can understand
a father's wish to see his child, my dear girl.""Indeed, I think it's cruel to keep her from you, sir.""Then look over your mistress' papers and try to obtain the street and
number where she is boarding in New York."Of course you have, sir," said the girl, readily.So it came about that the girl obtained Dan's address, and communicated
it to John Hartley.As soon as possible afterward Hartley sailed for New York."I'll secure the child," he said to himself, exultingly, "and then my
sweet sister-in-law must pay roundly for her if she wants her back."All which attested the devoted love of John Hartley for his child.ALTHEA'S ABDUCTION.Arrived in New York, John Hartley lost no time in ascertaining where Dan
and his mother lived.In order the better to watch without incurring
suspicion, he engaged by the week a room in a house opposite, which,
luckily for his purpose, happened to be for rent.It was a front window,
and furnished him with a post of observation from which he could see who
went in and out of the house opposite.Hartley soon learned that it would not be so easy as he had anticipated
to gain possession of the little girl.She never went out alone, but
always accompanied either by Dan or his mother.If, now, Althea were attending school, there
would be an opportunity to kidnap her.As it was, he was at his wits'
end.Mordaunt chanced to need some small
article necessary to the work upon which she was engaged.She might
indeed wait until the next day, but she was repairing a vest of Dan's,
which he would need to wear in the morning, and she did not like to
disappoint him."My child," she said, "I find I must go out a little while.""I want to buy some braid to bind Dan's vest.He will want to wear it in
the morning.""May I go with you, mamma?"You can be reading your picture-book till I come back.Mordaunt put on her street dress, and left the house in the
direction of Eighth avenue, where there was a cheap store at which she
often traded.No sooner did Hartley see her leave the house, as he could readily do,
for the night was light, than he hurried to Union Square, scarcely five
minutes distant, and hailed a cab-driver."Do you want a job, my man?""There is nothing wrong, sir, I hope."My child has been kidnapped during my absence in Europe."She is in the custody of some designing persons, who keep possession
of her on account of a fortune which she is to inherit.She does not
know me to be her father, we have been so long separated; but I feel
anxious to take her away from her treacherous guardians."I've got a little girl of my own, and I understand
your feelings.Fifteen minutes afterward the cab drew
up before Mrs.Brown's door, and Hartley, springing from it, rang the
bell.Brown was out, and a servant answered the
bell."A lady lives here with a little girl," he said, quickly."Precisely; and the little girl is named Althea."Mordaunt has been run over by a street-car, and been carried into
my house.She wishes the little girl to come at once to her.""I am afraid her leg is broken; but I can't wait.Will you bring the
little girl down at once?"Nancy went up stairs two steps at a time, and broke into Mrs."Put on your hat at once, Miss Althea," she said."But she said she was coming right back.""She's hurt, and she can't come, and she has sent for you."But how shall I know where to go, Nancy?""There's a kind gentleman at the door with a carriage.Your ma has been
taken to his home."I'm afraid mamma's been killed," she said."No, she hasn't, or how could she send for you?"This argument tended to reassure Althea, and she put on her little shawl
and hat, and hurried down stairs.Hartley was waiting for her impatiently, fearing that Mrs.Mordaunt
would come back sooner than was anticipated, and so interfere with the
fulfillment of his plans."So she calls this woman mamma," said Hartley to himself."Not very badly, but she cannot come home to-night.Get into the
carriage, and I will tell you about it as we are riding to her."He hurried the little girl into the carriage, and taking a seat beside
her, ordered the cabman to drive on.He had before directed him to drive to the South Ferry."She was crossing the street," said Hartley, "when she got in the way of
a carriage and was thrown down and run over."The carriage was not a heavy one, luckily, and
she is only badly bruised.She will be all right in a few days."John Hartley was a trifle inconsistent in his stories, having told the
servant that Mrs.Mordaunt had been run over by a street-car; but in
truth he had forgotten the details of his first narrative, and had
modified it in the second telling.However, Nancy had failed to tell the
child precisely how Mrs.Mordaunt had been hurt, and she was not old
enough to be suspicious."Not far from here," answered Hartley, evasively."Then I shall soon see mamma.""No, not my own mamma, but I call her so."My papa is a very bad man."I thought this was some of Harriet Vernon's work," said Hartley to
himself."It seems like my amiable sister-in-law.She might have been in
better business than poisoning my child's mind against me."he asked, partly out of curiosity, but mainly
to occupy the child's mind, so that she might not be fully conscious of
the lapse of time."Oh, yes; Dan is a nice boy.He has gone to a party
to-night.""And he won't be home till late."I am glad of that," thought Hartley.He goes down town every morning, and he doesn't come home
till supper time."Hartley managed to continue his inquiries about Dan, but at last Althea
became restless."I don't see how mamma could have gone so far.""I see how it is," he said."The cab-driver lost the way, and that has
delayed us."Meanwhile they reached the South
Ferry, and Hartley began to consider in what way he could explain their
crossing the water.After a moment's thought Hartley took a flask from his pocket, into
which he had dropped a sleeping potion, and offered it to the child."Drink, my dear," he said; "it will do you good."It was a sweet wine and pleasant to the taste."It is a cordial," answered Hartley.I will ask mamma to get some."I feel very sleepy," said Althea, drowsily, the potion having already
begun to attack her.The innocent and unsuspecting child did as she was directed.She struggled against the increasing drowsiness, but in
vain."There will be no further trouble," thought Hartley."When she wakes up
it will be morning.It might have been supposed that some instinct of parental affection
would have made it disagreeable to this man to kidnap his own child by
such means, but John Hartley had never been troubled with a heart or
natural affections.He was supremely selfish, and surveyed the sleeping
child as coolly and indifferently as if he had never before set eyes
upon her.Two miles and a half beyond the South Ferry, in a thinly settled
outlying district of Brooklyn, stood a three-story brick house, shabby
and neglected in appearance, bearing upon a sign over the door the name


         DONOVAN'S

     WINES AND LIQUORS.It was the nightly resort of a set of rough and lawless men, many of
them thieves and social outlaws, who drank and smoked as they sat at
small tables in the sand-strewn bar-room.Hugh Donovan himself had served a term at Sing Sing for burglary, and
was suspected to be indirectly interested in the ventures of others
engaged in similar offenses, though he managed to avoid arrest.John Hartley ordered the hackman to stop.He sprang from the carriage,
and unceremoniously entered the bar-room.Donovan, a short, thickset man
with reddish whiskers, a beard of a week's growth, and but one
serviceable eye, sat in a wooden arm-chair, smoking a clay pipe.There
were two other men in the room, and a newsboy sat dozing on a settee.Donovan looked up, and his face assumed a look of surprise as he met the
glance of the visitor, whom he appeared to know.he asked, taking the pipe from
his mouth."I have a job for her and for you."I want her taken care of for a few
days or weeks.""Shure, the old woman isn't a very good protector for a gal.There are reasons--imperative reasons--why the girl
should be concealed for a time, and I can think of no other place than
this."I have little time for explanation, but I may
tell you that she has been kept from me by my enemies, who wanted to get
hold of her money.""Did the old lady leave it all away from you, then?The least I can expect is to be made guardian of my
own child.Is there no way of getting up stairs
except by passing through the bar-room?"Hartley, we can go up the back way.At the rear of the house was a stair-way, up which he
clambered, bearing the sleeping child in his arms.Donovan pushed the door open, and disclosed a dirty room, with his
better-half--a tall, gaunt woman--reclining in a rocking-chair,
evidently partially under the influence of liquor, as might be guessed
from a black bottle on a wooden table near by.She stared in astonishment at her husband's companions."Shure, Hugh, who is it you're bringin' here?""It's a child, old woman, that you're to have the care of.""Divil a bit do I want a child to worrit me.""Will I get the money, or Hugh?""You shall have half, Bridget," said her husband."I will pay ten dollars a week--half to you, and half to your husband,"
said Hartley."Here's a week's pay in advance," and he took out two
five-dollar bills, one of which was eagerly clutched by Mrs."I'll take care of her," said she, readily."Shure that's a quare name.You can call her any name you like," said
Hartley, indifferently."Perhaps you had better call her Katy, as there
may be a hue and cry after her, and that may divert suspicion."Donovan, and she opened the door of a small
room, in which was a single untidy bed.I gave her a sleeping potion--otherwise
she might have made a fuss, for she doesn't know me to be her father."Donovan, I depend upon your keeping her safe.It will not do
to let her escape, for she might find her way back to the people from
whom I have taken her.""Say nothing about me in connection with the matter, Donovan.I will
communicate with you from time to time.If the police are put on the
track, I depend on your sending her away to some other place of
security."I shall go back to New York at once.I must leave
you to pacify her as well as you can when she awakes."I'll trate her like my own child," said Mrs.Had Hartley been a devoted father, this assurance from the coarse,
red-faced woman would have been satisfactory, but he cared only for the
child as a means of replenishing his pockets, and gave himself no
trouble.The hackman was still waiting at the door."It's a queer place to leave a child," thought he, as his experienced
eye took in the features of the place."It appears to be a liquor
saloon.However, it is none of
my business."Driver, I am ready," said Hartley."Go over Fulton Ferry, and leave me at your stand in Union Square."Hartley threw himself back on the seat, and
gave himself up to pleasant self-congratulation."I think this will bring Harriet Vernon to terms," he said."She will
find that she can't stand between me and my child.If she will make it
worth my while, she shall have the child back, but I propose to see that
my interests are secured."The next morning Hartley stepped into an up-town hotel, and wrote a
letter to his sister-in-law in London, demanding that four thousand
dollars be sent him yearly, in quarterly payments, in consideration of
which he agreed to give up the child, and abstain from further
molestation.ALTHEA BECOMES KATY DONOVAN.The sleeping potion which had been administered to Althea kept her in
sound sleep till eight o'clock the next morning.When her eyes opened,
and she became conscious of her surroundings, she looked about her in
surprise.Then she sat up in bed and gazed wildly at the torn wall paper
and dirty and shabby furniture.The door opened, and the red and inflamed face of Mrs."I want mamma," answered the child, still more frightened."Shure I'm your ma, child.""No, you are not," said Althea.I sent you away to board, but
you've come home to live with your ma."You are a bad woman," returned the child,
ready to cry."It's a purty thing for a child to tell her ma she's lyin'.""Don't you go
on talkin' that way, but get right up, or you sha'n't have any
breakfast.""Oh, send me back to my mother and Dan!""Dress yourself, and I'll see about it," said Mrs.Althea looked for her clothes, but could not find them.In their place
she found a faded calico dress and some ragged undergarments, which had
once belonged to a daughter of Mrs."Those clothes are not mine," said Althea."I had a pretty pink dress and a nice new skirt.These was the clothes you took off last night,"
said Mrs."I won't put this dress on," said the child, indignantly."Then you'll have to lay abed all day, and won't get nothing to eat,"
said the woman."Shure you're a quare child to ask your own mother's name."That's a quare name intirely.I'm afraid
you're gone crazy, Katy."Was it possible that she could be Katy Donovan,
and that this red-faced woman was her mother?She began to doubt her own
identity.She could not remember this woman, but was it possible that
there was any connection between them?"I used to live in New York with Mamma Mordaunt.""Well, you're livin' in Brooklyn now with Mamma Donovan.""Shure I shouldn't have sent you away from me to have you come home and
deny your own mother.""Will you let me go to New York and see Mamma Mordaunt?"asked Althea,
after a pause."If you're a good girl, perhaps I will.Now get up, and I'll give you
some breakfast."With a shudder of dislike Althea arrayed herself in the dirty garments
of the real Katy Donovan, and looked at her image in the cracked mirror
with a disgust which she could not repress.Hartley had suggested that her own garments should be taken away in
order to make her escape less feasible.She opened the door, and entered the room in which Mrs.Donovan had set
the table for breakfast.As she came in at one door, Hugh Donovan entered at another."Come here, little gal," he said, with a grin.Althea looked at him with real terror.Certainly Hugh Donovan was not a
man to attract a child.Althea at once thought of an ogre whom Dan had described to her in a
fairy story, and half fancied that she was in the power of such a
creature."I don't want to," said the child, trembling."Go to your father, Katy," said Mrs.Althea shuddered at the idea, and she gazed as if
fascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little
gals--'specially when they're my own.""Yes, you be, and don't you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,
thinking it a good joke."Well, it'll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we'll see
what the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little
bread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house
was responsible.When the meal was over she said:

"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,
and you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they
could be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed
at the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Hugh Donovan's face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what's best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.Her husband took it,
and brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you'll feel it if you don't stop your howlin'."Althea gazed at him horror-stricken."I thought you'd come to your senses," he said, in a tone of
satisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as
she cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and
hopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,
and wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which
at once drew the attention of Mrs."I can't help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip
with which her husband had threatened the child."I'll give ye something
to cry for.""Oh, don't--don't beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.I mean I won't unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart
sinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs."Shure, if you'll be a good gal, I'll give you all the pleasure
I can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged
sun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the
house, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her
supplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child's curiosity on
her way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her
sorrow."Shure it's my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink
which prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become
afraid of her new guardians.She felt
sure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was
Dan to know where she was.The poor child's lips quivered, and she could
hardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea's disappearance that he felt it
necessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her
recovery."I'll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake
thinking of her, for it won't do any good."I didn't know how much I loved the dear child
till I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her
again."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up
bright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won't have any time, Dan.Rogers,
telling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is
to be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not
feel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how
the little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your
mother broke her leg, and I didn't think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to
be of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and
interview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was
absent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying
a gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between
Eighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His
courage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that
a child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea's age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said."You would
have saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan
to himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been
unobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve
as he noted our hero's inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don't think
you'll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:

"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite
the house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly
afterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man's appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I
believe his hair was brown"--Hartley's was black."I am sorry I can't
remember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab
drove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,
'Drive to Harlem.'""Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully."That puts me on the right
track."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me
know," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite
yours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to
deceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of
your search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive
intelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look
after you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while
you are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait
three weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had
one source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet
Vernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be
seriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse
to the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He
did not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of
success should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his
child's expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western
adventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley's want of
character, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a
hazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some
genuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of
shares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a
hundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a
corresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the
overtures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious
investigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and
how well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was
so satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in
train.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful
accomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously
raised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man
from Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as
collateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without
a doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars
between them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary
assistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It's a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he
thought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is
likely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand
of her.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a
Cunard steamer.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and
decided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good
advantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for
sale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting
surprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed
upon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it probable that the man who carried away Althea would give the
right direction so that it could be overheard by a third party?No; it
was probably meant as a blind, and I have been just fool enough to fall
into the trap."Before the day was over they were wholly opened.He met John Hartley on
Broadway toward the close of the afternoon."Well, have you heard anything of your sister?"he asked, with an
appearance of interest."Keep on, you will find her in time."After they parted, Dan, happening to look back, detected a mocking
glance in the face of his questioner, and a new discovery flashed upon
him.He had sent him to Harlem,
purposely misleading him."Can he have had anything to do
with the abduction of Althea?"This was a question which he could not satisfactorily answer, but he
resolved to watch Hartley, and follow him wherever he went, in the hope
of obtaining some clew.Of course he must assume some disguise, as
Hartley must not recognize him.He hired a room on East Fourth street for a week, and then sought an
Italian boy to whom he had occasionally given a few pennies, and with
some difficulty (for Giovanni knew but little English, and he no
Italian) proposed that the Italian should teach him to sing and play
"Viva Garibaldi."Dan could play a little on the violin, and soon
qualified himself for his new business.At a second-hand shop on Chatham street he picked up a suit of tattered
velvet, obtained a liquid with which to stain his skin to a dark brown,
and then started out as an Italian street musician.His masquerade suit
he kept in his room at East Fourth street, changing therefrom his street
dress morning and evening.When in full masquerade he for the first time
sang and played, Giovanni clapped his hands with delight.Giovanni was puzzled to understand why Dan took so much pains to enter
upon a hard and unprofitable profession, but Dan did not enlighten him
as to his motive.He thought it most prudent to keep his secret, even from his mother.One
day he met her on the sidewalk, and began to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Mordaunt listened without a suspicion that it was her own son, and
gave him two pennies, which he acknowledged by a low bow, and "Grazia,
signora.""I hope his padrone does not beat him," said Mrs."I hear these poor boys are much abused.I wonder if I can make him
understand?"Si, signora, padrone," answered Dan."It is no use; he doesn't understand English.Here is some more money
for you," and she handed him a five-cent coin."Its a wise mother that knows her own child," thought Dan.Hartley boarded a University Place car, and Dan jumped on also.Italian boys so seldom ride that the conductor eyed Dan with some
suspicion."I thought you might be expecting to ride for nothing," said the
conductor."Seems to me you're flush for an Italian fiddler.""And I don't understand your lingo."A charitable lady inside the car chanced to see Dan, and it occurred to
her that she would do him a service."If the conductor doesn't object, you may sing while we are on our way."You can sing and play," said the conductor, good-naturedly.Dan was not at all desirous of doing this, for Hartley sat only three
feet from him, and he feared he might recognize him, but it would not be
in character to refuse, so he began, and sang his one air, playing an
accompaniment.Several of the passengers handed him small coins, among
them Hartley."I can't agree with you, ma'am," said Hartley."I would rather give him
money to stop.""His voice strikes me as very rich, and the Italian is such a beautiful
language.""I have heard a good deal better performers even among the street boys,"
said Hartley."So have I," said Dan to himself."He doesn't suspect me; I am glad of
that."Hartley remained in the car till it reached the Astor House, and so, of
course, did Dan.In fact, Hartley was on his way to Brooklyn to pay
another installment to the guardians of the little girl whom he had
carried off.Hartley kept on his way to Fulton Ferry, Dan following at a prudent
distance.Had Hartley looked back, he would have suspected nothing, for he had not
penetrated Dan's disguise, and would therefore have been quite at a loss
to understand any connection between the street musician and himself.They both boarded the same ferry-boat, and landed in Brooklyn together.At this moment Hartley turned round, and his glance fell upon Dan."Si, signor," answered Dan, bowing deferentially."I sing, I play," said our hero."It is lucky you don't, or you might not like my compliment.""Shall I sing 'Viva Garibaldi?'"Here, take
this money, and don't sing.""Si, signor," answered Dan, assuming a look of bewilderment.Hartley prepared to board a car, which was not yet ready to start.Dan
rapidly decided that it would not do for him to follow Hartley any
farther.Looking about him, his eye fell
on a bright-looking newsboy of about twelve."Do you want to make some money, Johnny?""Did you speak to me, Garibaldi?""Yes, but I am no Italian," said Dan, rapidly."I am on the track of
that man, but he suspects me.I will give you a dollar if you will jump
on the car and find out where he goes."Pay your expenses out of it, and I will pay you back when you
report to me."The newsboy ran, jumped on the car, and it moved on."It is the best thing I could do," thought Dan."I hope the boy is
sharp, and won't lose sight of him.I feel sure that he had something
to do with carrying off poor little Althea."For two hours Dan lingered near the ferry, playing occasionally by way
of filling up the time.It seemed to be a good location, for he received
from fifty to sixty cents from passers-by."When hard times come," thought Dan, "I shall know what to do.I will
become an Italian street singer."After two hours the newsboy jumped off an incoming car, and approached
Dan.DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's eyes sparkled with joy at the success of his plan."Now tell me," he said, drawing the newsboy aside to a place where they
would not be overheard."You've made a fortun' by fiddling, you have," said the newsboy, in
surprise.The newsboy described his following Hartley to Donovan's.Hartley went in, and he directly afterward."Perhaps he only went in for a drink," suggested Dan, uneasily."No, he didn't call for nothing to drink.I saw him take out some money
and give to the man and the woman."I axed old Donovan to buy a paper, and he wouldn't.Then I
sat down for a minute, makin' believe I was tired.They looked at me,
but I didn't appear to be noticin' 'em, and they let me stay.""Did you see anything of a little girl?""Yes, there was a little gal came in.Donovan's daughter, he feared, not the
child he was seeking.He added a description of the little girl which quite revived Dan's
hopes, for it answered in every respect to Althea."Did you hear the little girl say anything?""Yes, she told her mother she wanted to see Dan.""You needn't tell me any more."Have you found out what you want to know?"Have you anything to do for the next two hours?""Then I'll pay you another dollar to go to the place with me.I think I
could find it myself, but I can't take any chances.And don't say a word
about what you have seen.""She is my adopted sister, and she has been stolen from us.""Then I'd be willing to help you for nothing.I've got a little sister
about her size.If anybody stole her, I'd mash him!"The two boys boarded a car, and in forty minutes got out."That's the place," said the newsboy, pointing out Donovan's, only a few
rods away.You'd better leave me now, or you may be remembered, and
that would lead them to suspect me.If I do, it'll be through your help."He stopped in the street, and began
to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Two or three boys gathered about him, and finally a couple of men.One
of them handed him a three-cent piece."Grazio, signor," said Dan, pulling off his hat."What part of Italy do you come from?""Si, signor, I come from Italy," answered Dan, not considering it
prudent to understand too well."His hair doesn't look like that of most Italians."I'd know him for an Italian boy anywhere."At this moment the door of the saloon opened, and Dan, putting his
violin under his arm, entered.One was an Irishman, the other a German.Both
had evidently drank more than was good for them.Dan looked in vain for
Althea."Well, boy, what do you want?"asked Dan, uncertain whether he was talking
as an Italian boy might be expected to."No; I don't want to hear any fiddle-scraping.""Shure, let him play a little, Mister Donovan," said the Irishman."Just as you like," said Donovan, carelessly, "only I have no money for
him."Dan struck up his one tune--Viva Garibaldi--but the Irishman did not
seem to care for that."Oh, bother ould Garibaldi!"Accordingly he tried to play an air popular enough at the time, but
made bad work of it.exclaimed the German, who had a better musical ear
than the Irishman."Here, lend me your fiddle, boy."He took the violin, and in spite of his inebriety, managed to play a
German air upon it."Shure you bate the boy at his own trade," said the Irishman.The German indicated his preference, and the Irishman called for whisky."I no drink," answered our hero, shaking his head."Shure you're an Italian wonder, and it's Barnum ought to hire you.""Then you're a haythen," said Pat Moriarty.He gulped down the whisky, and finding it more convenient to sit than to
stand, fell back upon a settee."I wish Althea would come in," thought Dan.At that moment a heavy fall was heard in the room overhead, and a
child's shrill scream directly afterward."Something's happened to my wife," muttered Donovan.He hurried up stairs, and the German followed.This gave Dan an excuse
for running up, too.Donovan had been drinking more copiously than usual.While in this
condition she imprudently got upon a chair to reach a pitcher from an
upper shelf.Her footing was uncertain, and she fell over, pitcher in
hand, the chair sharing in the downfall.When her husband entered the room she was lying flat on her back,
grasping the handle of the pitcher, her eyes closed, and her breathing
stertorious.Althea, alarmed, stood over her, crying and screaming."The old woman's taken too much," said Donovan.he
shouted, leaning over his matrimonial partner."Ain't you ashamed of
yourself, now?"Donovan opened her eyes, and stared at him vacantly."On your back, you old fool, where you deserve to be.""It's the whisky," murmured the fallen lady.Why can't you drink dacent like me?Shure it's a purty
example you're settin' to the child.Ain't you ashamed to lie here in a
hape before them gintlemen?"This called Althea's attention to the German and Dan.In spite of Dan's
disguise, she recognized him with a cry of joy.she exclaimed, dashing past
Donovan, and clasping her arms round the supposed Italian.exclaimed Donovan, looking at the two in surprise."Oh, it's my brother Dan," exclaimed Althea."You'll take me away, won't
you, Dan?"So that's your game, my young chicken, is it?"demanded Donovan,
seizing our hero roughly by the shoulder.Then pulling off Dan's hat, he
added: "You're no more Italian than I am."Dan saw that it would be useless to keep up the deceit any longer.He
looked Donovan full in the face, and said, firmly:

"You are right, Mr.Donovan, I have come here for my sister."Donovan's red face turned fairly purple with rage.Why, I could crush you with my little
finger.""I have not insulted you," said Dan."I don't know anything about your sister."That little girl is my adopted sister," said Dan, pointing to Althea."Ask her if she doesn't know me.""That is my daughter, Katy Donovan," said the saloon keeper."No, I am not," said Althea, beginning to cry."I want to go away with
my brother Dan."Donovan," (by
this time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), "is
not this our little Katy?""You see, young man, you're mistaken.You can leave," and Donovan waved
his hand triumphantly.I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since
living with my mother."said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his
fingers."I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house," continued
Dan."The same man has been here to-day," added Dan.How much does he pay you for taking
care of the girl?""I can't waste my time
talkin' wid you."No, I won't, unless Althea goes with me," said Dan, firmly.We'll see about that," and Donovan, making a rush,
seized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero's
resistance."I'll tache you to come here insultin' your betters!"Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match
for a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance.The Irishman
already referred to was still upon the settee.he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his
burden."What's the lad been doin'?""What's he been doin', is it?He's been insultin' me to my face--that's
what the Donovans won't stand."Don't trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you.Not quite willingly, but reluctant to offend Donovan, who gave him
credit for the drinks, Barney raised a trap-door leading to the cellar
below.There was a ladder for the convenience of those wishing to ascend and
descend, but Donovan was not disposed to use much ceremony with the boy
who had offended him.He dropped him through the opening, Dan by good
luck falling on his feet."That's the best place for you, you young meddler!""You'll
find it mighty comfortable, and I wish you much joy.I won't charge you
no rint, and that's an object in these hard times--eh, Barney?""To be sure it is," said Barney; "but all the same, Donovan, I'd rather
pay rint up stairs, if I had my choice!""He hasn't the choice," said Donovan triumphantly."What's it all about now, Donovan?""He wanted to shtale my Katy," said Donovan.asked Donovan, not caring to go
into particulars.Barney indicated his choice with alacrity, and, after drinking, was
hardly in a condition to pursue his inquiries.DAN DISCOMFITS THE DONOVANS.Dan found himself at first bewildered and confused by his sudden descent
into the cellar.As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he was
able to get an idea of his surroundings.It was a common cellar with an
earthen floor.Ranged along one side was a row of kegs, some containing
whisky, others empty.Besides, there were a few boxes and odds and ends
which had been placed here to get them out of the way."Not a very cheerful-looking place," thought Dan, "though I do get it
rent free."He sat down on a box, and began to consider his position.The walls were solid, and although there was a narrow
window, consisting of a row of single panes, it was at the top of the
cellar, and not easily accessible.He might indeed reach it by the
ladder, but he would have to break the glass and crawl through, a mode
of escape likely to be attended by personal risk."No, that won't do," thought Dan."At any rate, I won't try it till
other things fail."Meanwhile Donovan, in the bar-room above, was in high good humor.He
felt that he had done a sharp thing, and more than once chuckled as he
thought of his prisoner below.Indeed he could not forbear, after about
half an hour, lifting the trap and calling down stairs:

"Hallo, there!""You're an impudent jackanapes!""You'll
get enough of it before you're through.""So will you," answered Dan, boldly."I'll take the risk," chuckled Donovan."Do you know what you remind me
of?""You're like a rat in a trap.""Not exactly," answered Dan, as a bright thought dawned upon him."Because a rat can do no harm, and I can."It occurred to Donovan that Dan might have some matches in his pocket,
and was momentarily alarmed at the thought that our hero might set the
house on fire."If you had," said the saloon-keeper, relieved, "it would do you no good
to set a fire."I don't mean to set the house on fire," said Dan, composedly.returned Dan, rising from his seat on the box.asked Donovan, following with his glance the
boy's motion."I'm going to take the spigot out of them
whisky-kegs, and let the whisky run out on the floor."exclaimed the saloon-keeper, now thoroughly
frightened.As he spoke Dan dextrously pulled the spigot from a keg, and Donovan, to
his dismay, heard the precious liquid--precious in his eyes--pouring out
upon the floor.With an exertion he raised the trap-door, hastily descended the ladder,
and rushed to the keg to replace the spigot.Meanwhile Dan ran up the ladder, pulled it after him, and made his late
jailer a captive."Put down the ladder, you young rascal!"roared Donovan, when, turning
from his work, he saw how the tables had been turned."It wouldn't be convenient just yet," answered Dan, coolly.He shut the trap-door, hastily lugged the ladder to the rear of the
house (unobserved, for there were no customers present), then dashed up
stairs and beckoned to Althea to follow him.Donovan was stupefied by liquor.Putting on her things, the little girl hastily and gladly obeyed.As they passed through the saloon, Donovan's execrations and shouts were
heard proceeding from the cellar."Never you mind, Althea," said Dan.The two children hurried to the nearest horse-car, which luckily came up
at the moment, and jumped on board.Dan looked back with a smile at the saloon, saying to himself:

"I rather think, Mr.Donovan, you've found your match this time.I hope
you'll enjoy the cellar as much as I did."In about an hour and a half Dan, holding Althea by the hand,
triumphantly led her into his mother's presence."I've brought her back, mother," he said."Oh, my dear, dear little girl!""I
thought I should never, never see you again.But we will not wait to hear a twice-told tale.Rather let us return to
Donovan, where the unhappy proprietor is still a captive in his own
cellar.Here he remained till his cries attracted the attention of a
wondering customer, who finally lifted the trap-door."What are you doin' down there?""Put down the ladder and let me up first of all."It was a considerable time before the ladder was found.Then the
saloon-keeper emerged from his prison in a very bad humor."I wish I had left you there," said the customer, with justifiable
indignation."This is your gratitude for my trouble, is it?""Excuse me, but I'm so mad with that cursed boy."Come, that's talking," said the placated customer."Wait a minute," said Donovan, a sudden fear possessing him.He rushed up stairs and looked for Althea.His wife was lying on the floor, breathing heavily, but the little girl
was gone.exclaimed Donovan,
sinking into a chair.Then, in a blind fury with the wife who didn't prevent the little girl's
recapture, he seized a pail of water and emptied it over the face of the
prostrate woman.Donovan came to, and berated her husband furiously."Serves you right, you jade!"It was certainly an unlucky day for the Donovans.After calling at Donovan's, on the day when Dan recovered Althea, John
Hartley crossed the Courtlandt street ferry, and took a train to
Philadelphia with Blake, his accomplice in the forged certificates.The
two confederates had raised some Pennsylvania railway certificates,
which they proposed to put on the Philadelphia market.They spent several days in the Quaker City, and thus Hartley heard
nothing of the child's escape.Donovan did not see fit to inform him, as this would stop the weekly
remittance for the child's board, and, moreover, draw Hartley's
indignation down upon his head.One day, in a copy of the _New York Herald_, which he purchased at the
news-stand in the Continental Hotel, Hartley observed the arrival of
Harriet Vernon at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."I thought she would come," he said to himself, with a smile."I have
her in my power at last.She must submit to my terms, or lose sight of
the child altogether.""Blake," he said, aloud, "I must take the first train to New York.""On the contrary, I see a chance of making a good haul."Vernon sat in her room at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.A servant brought up a card bearing the name of John
Hartley."He is prompt," she said to herself, with a smile."Probably he has not
heard of Althea's escape from the den to which he carried her.I will
humor him, in that case, and draw him out.""I will see the gentleman in the parlor," she said.Five minutes later she entered the ladies' parlor.Hartley rose to
receive her with a smile of conscious power, which told Harriet Vernon
that he was ignorant of the miscarriage of his plans."I heard of your _unexpected_ arrival, Mrs.Vernon," he commenced, "and
have called to pay my respects.""Your motive is appreciated, John Hartley," she said, coldly."That's pleasant," he said, mockingly."May I beg to apologize for
constraining you to cross the Atlantic?""Don't apologize; you have merely acted out your nature.""Probably that is not meant to be complimentary.However, it can't be
helped.""I suppose you have something to say to me, John Hartley," said Mrs.I wrote you that I had ferreted out your cunningly
devised place of concealment for my daughter."She seemed very cool and composed,
whereas he expected she would be angry and disturbed."We may as well come to business at once," he said."If you wish to
recover the charge of your ward, you must accede to my terms.""They are expressed in my letter to you.You must agree to pay me a
thousand dollars each quarter.""It strikes me you are exorbitant in your demands."At any rate, the money won't come out of you.It will
come from my daughter's income.""So you would rob your daughter, John Hartley?"Is
she to live in luxury, and with thousands to spare, while I, her only
living parent, wander penniless and homeless about the world.""I might sympathize with you, if I did not know how you have misused the
gifts of fortune, and embittered the existence of my poor sister.As it
is, it only disgusts me.""I don't want you sympathy, Harriet Vernon," he said, roughly."I want
four thousand dollars a year.""Suppose I decline to let you have it?""Then you must take the consequences," he said, quickly."That you and Althea will be forever separated.He looked at her intently to see the effect of his threat.Harriet Vernon was as cool and imperturbable as ever."Have you been in New York for a week past?"she asked, as he thought,
irrelevantly."Because you don't appear to know what has happened."As for me, I bid you good-evening.""I mean, John Hartley, that you are not as shrewd as you imagine.I mean
that a boy has foiled you; and while you were doubtless laughing at his
simplicity, he has proved more than a match for you.You have no claim
upon me, and I must decline your disinterested proposal."She left the room, leaving him crest-fallen and stupefied.He started for Brooklyn immediately, and toward eleven o'clock entered
the saloon at Donovan's."She's gone," he cried, "but I couldn't help it, Mr.On my
honor, I couldn't."The story was told, Donovan ending by invoking curses upon the boy who
had played such a trick upon him."I am ashamed of you, for
allowing a boy to get the best of you.""That boy's a fox," said Donovan."He's a match for the old one, he is.I'd like to break his neck for him."I may get hold of the girl again," mused Hartley, as
he rose to go."If I do, I won't put her in charge of such a
dunderhead."He left Donovan's and returned to New York, but he had hardly left the
Fulton ferry-boat when he was tapped on the shoulder by an officer."A little financial irregularity, as they call it in Wall street.You
may know something about some raised railroad certificates!"The morning papers contained an account of John Hartley's arrest, and
the crime with which he was charged.Harriet Vernon read it at the breakfast-table with an interest which may
be imagined."I don't like to rejoice in any man's misfortune," she said to herself,
"but now I can have a few years of peace.My precious brother-in-law
will doubtless pass the next few years in enforced seclusion, and I can
have a settled home."Directly after breakfast, she set out for the humble home of her niece.She found all at home, for Dan was not to go back to business till
Monday."Well, my good friend," she said, "I have news for you.""Good news, I hope," said Dan.Henceforth I can have Althea with me.The obstacle that
separated us is removed."Mordaunt's countenance fell, and Dan looked sober.It was plain
that Althea was to be taken from them, and they had learned to love her."I am very glad," faltered Mrs."You don't look glad," returned Mrs."You see we don't like to part with Althea," explained Dan, who
understood his mother's feelings."Who said you were to part with the child?""I thought you meant to take her from us."Your mistake is a natural one, for I have not told you my
plans.I mean to take a house up town, install Mrs.Mordaunt as my
housekeeper and friend, and adopt this young man (indicating Dan),
provided he has no objection."I have plenty of money, and no one to care for, or to
care for me.I have taken a fancy to you all, and I am quite sure that
we can all live happily together.Althea is my niece, and you, Dan, may
call me aunt, too, if you like.Dan offered her his hand in a frank, cordial way, which she liked."So it is settled, then," she said, in a pleased voice."I ought to warn
you," she added, "that I have the reputation of being ill-tempered.You
may get tired of living with me.""We'll take the risk," said Dan, smiling.Vernon, whose habit it was to act promptly, engaged a house on
Madison avenue, furnished it without regard to expense, and in less than
a fortnight, installed her friends in it.Then she had a talk with Dan
about his plans."Do you wish to remain in your place," she asked, "or would you like to
obtain a better education first?""To obtain an education," said Dan, promptly."Then give notice to your employer of your intention."Vernon in a second interview informed him that besides defraying
his school expenses, she should give him an allowance of fifty dollars a
month for his own personal needs."May I give a part of it to my mother?""You don't ask why I refuse," she said."I suppose you have a good reason," said Dan, dubiously."My reason is that I shall pay your mother double this sum.Unless she
is very extravagant it ought to be enough to defray her expenses."exclaimed Dan, in fresh
astonishment.All these important changes in the position of the Mordaunts were
unknown to their old friends, who, since their loss of property, had
given them the cold shoulder.One day Tom Carver, in passing the house, saw Dan coming down the steps
quite as handsomely dressed as himself."I didn't know what else could carry you to such a house.""Oh, that's easily explained," said Dan."You don't mean to say she boards there?"asked Tom, in a more deferential tone.At any rate she gives me a handsome allowance.""And you don't have anything to do?""Why, my father only
allows me three dollars a week."I don't need as much as my aunt allows me.""I say, Dan," said Tom, in the most friendly terms, "I'm awfully hard
up."Yes," said Dan, secretly amused with the change in Tom's manner.said Tom, linking his arm in Dan's."I'm very glad you're rich again."Thank you," said Dan, smiling, "but I'm afraid you have forgotten
something.""You know I used to be a newsboy in front of the Astor House.""And you might not care to associate with a newsboy.""Well, you are all right now," said Tom, magnanimously."You didn't always think so, Tom.""I always thought you were a gentleman, Dan."I suppose it's the way of the world," thought Dan."It is lucky that
there are some true friends who stick by us through thick and thin."Mordaunt had an experience similar to Dan's.Her old acquaintances,
who, during her poverty never seemed to recognize her when they met,
gradually awoke to the consciousness of her continued existence, and
left cards.She received them politely, but rated their professions of
friendship at their true value.They had not been "friends in need," and
she could not count them "friends indeed."Six years rolled by, bringing with them many changes.The little family
on Madison avenue kept together.She had a hearty love for young people, and enjoyed the growth and
development of her niece Althea, and Dan, whom she called her nephew and
loved no less.He completed his preparation for college, and
graduated with high honors.He is no less frank, handsome, and
self-reliant than when as a boy he sold papers in front of the Astor
House for his mother's support.He looks forward to a business life, and
has accepted an invitation to go abroad to buy goods in London and Paris
for his old firm.He was, in fact, preparing to go when a mysterious
letter was put in his hands.It ran thus:


     "MR.DANIEL MORDAUNT:--I shall take it as a great favor if you will
     come to the St.Nicholas Hotel this evening, and inquire for me.I
     am sick, or I would not trouble you.I have to speak
     to you on a matter of great importance."I don't know of any one of that name."I cannot think of any one," said Mrs."I hope you won't go,
Dan," she added, anxiously; "it may be a trap laid by a wicked and
designing man.""You forget that I am not a boy any longer, mother," said Dan, smiling."I think I can defend myself, even if Mr.Davis is a wicked and
designing person."To her he was
still a boy, though in the eyes of others an athletic young man.Davis at the hotel, Dan was ushered into a room on
the third floor.Seated in an arm-chair was an elderly man, weak and
wasted, apparently in the last stages of consumption."It would have been well if he had not known me, for I did him a great
wrong."said Dan, trying to connect the name with his
father.You see before you Robert Hunting, once your
father's book-keeper."Dan's handsome face darkened, and he said, bitterly:

"You killed my father!""Heaven help me, I fear I did!"sighed Davis--to call him by his later
name."The money of which you robbed him caused him to fail, and failure led
to his death.""I have accused myself of this crime oftentimes," moaned Davis."Don't
think that the money brought happiness, for it did not."From Europe I went to
Brazil, and engaged in business in Rio Janeiro.A year since I found my
health failing, and have come back to New York to die.But before I die
I want to make what reparation I can.""You cannot call my father back to me," said Dan, sadly."No; but I can restore the money that I stole.That is the right
word--stole.I hope you and your mother have not suffered?""We saw some hard times, but for years we have lived in comfort."Will you bring a lawyer to me to-morrow evening?"You might keep every dollar if you would bring my father back."The next evening Davis transferred to Dan and his mother property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, in payment of what he had taken,
with interest, and in less than a month later he died, Dan taking upon
himself the charge of the funeral.His trip to Europe was deferred, and
having now capital to contribute, he was taken as junior partner into
the firm where he had once filled the position of office-boy.His father had failed disastrously, and
Tom is glad to accept a minor clerkship from the boy at whom he once
sneered.Julia Rogers has never lost her preference for Dan.It is whispered that
they are engaged, or likely soon to be, and Dan's assiduous attentions
to the young lady make the report a plausible one.John Hartley was sentenced to a term of years in prison.Harriet Vernon
dreaded the day of his release, being well convinced that he would seize
the earliest opportunity to renew his persecutions.She had about made
up her mind to buy him off, when she received intelligence that he was
carried off by fever, barely a month before the end of his term.It was
a sad end of a bad life, but she could not regret him.Althea was saved
the knowledge of her father's worthlessness.She was led to believe that
he had died when she was a little girl.Dan, the young detective, has entered
upon a career of influence and prosperity.The hardships of his earlier
years contributed to strengthen his character, and give him that
self-reliance of which the sons of rich men so often stand in need.A
similar experience might have benefited Tom Carver, whose lofty
anticipations have been succeeded by a very humble reality.Let those
boys who are now passing through the discipline of poverty and
privation, take courage and emulate the example of "Dan, the Detective."A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS

For Young People

BY POPULAR WRITERS,

97-99-101 Reade Street, New York.+Bonnie Prince Charlie+: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.The
boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite
agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and
serves with the French army at Dettingen.He kills his father's foe in a
duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince
Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland."Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.'The
     lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up
     as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read.For freshness
     of treatment and variety of incident Mr.Henty has surpassed
     himself."--_Spectator._


     +With Clive in India+; or, the Beginnings of an Empire.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme.At its
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the
native princes.At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the
greater part of Southern India.The author has given a full and accurate
account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges
follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his
narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike
interest to the volume."He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital
     importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story
     which of itself is deeply interesting.Young people assuredly will
     be delighted with the volume."--_Scotsman._


     +The Lion of the North+: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of
     Religion.With full-page Illustrations by JOHN
     SCHÖNBERG.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War.The issue had its importance, which has extended to
the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany.The
army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen,
and among these was the hero of the story."The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys
     may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to
     be profited."--_Times._


     +The Dragon and the Raven+; or, The Days of King Alfred.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between
Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of
the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of
the sea-wolves.The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the
battles fought by King Alfred.He is driven from his home, takes to the
sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by
them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris."Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish
     reader."--_Athenæum._


     +The Young Carthaginian+: A Story of the Times of Hannibal.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest.That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but
took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge.To
let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the
world Mr.Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic
style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history,
but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the
reader.From first to last nothing
     stays the interest of the narrative.It bears us along as on a
     stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its
     force."--_Saturday Review._


     +In Freedom's Cause+: A Story of Wallace and Bruce.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War
of Independence.The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace
and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed
at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages.The
researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a
living, breathing man--and a valiant champion.The hero of the tale
fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical
accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth'scapes" and wild adventure."It is written in the author's best style.Full of the wildest and
     most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which
     a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one
     side."--_The Schoolmaster._


     +With Lee in Virginia+: A Story of the American Civil War.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his
sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage
and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of
the struggle.He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded
and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two
cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he
had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties."One of the best stories for lads which Mr.The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and
     romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal
     interest and charm of the story."--_Standard._


     +By England's Aid+; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE, and
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service
of one of "the fighting Veres."After many adventures by sea and land,
one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the
defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the
Corsairs.He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection
of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture
of Cadiz.It overflows with stirring
     incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of
     the scene are finely reproduced.The illustrations add to its
     attractiveness."--_Boston Gazette._


     +By Right of Conquest+; or, With Cortez in Mexico.With full-page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY, and Two Maps.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.50.The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the
magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most
romantic and daring exploits in history.With this as the groundwork of
his story Mr.Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth,
Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had
sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the
Spaniards in the New World.He is beset by many perils among the
natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the
devotion of an Aztec princess.At last by a ruse he obtains the
protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in
regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride."'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly
     successful historical tale that Mr.Henty has yet
     published."--_Academy._


     +In the Reign of Terror+: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of
a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to
Paris at the crisis of the Revolution.Imprisonment and death reduce
their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three
young daughters of the house in his charge.After hairbreadth escapes
they reach Nantes.There the girls are condemned to death in the
coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy
protector."Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat
     Mr.His adventures will delight boys by the
     audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr.Henty's
     best."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Wolfe in Canada+; or, The Winning of a Continent.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._


     +The Lion of St.Mark+: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to
the severest tests.The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which
carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and
bloodshed.He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at
Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of
one of the chief men of Venice."Every boy should read 'The Lion of St.Henty has never
     produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more
     vivacious."--_Saturday Review._


     +A Final Reckoning+: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by W. B. WOLLEN.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates
to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police.A
few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with
both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he
eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._


     +Under Drake's Flag+: A Tale of the Spanish Main.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._


     +By Sheer Pluck+: A Tale of the Ashanti War.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details
of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness.His hero,
after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner
by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and
accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories.'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read."--_Athenæum._


     +By Pike and <DW18>+: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds of an
English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age--William the
Silent.Edward Martin, the son of an English sea-captain, enters the
service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many
dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes
through the great sieges of the time.He ultimately settles down as Sir
Edward Martin."Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with
     the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be
     students in spite of themselves."--_St.James' Gazette._


     +St.George for England+: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than
that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after
being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the
Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject

     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are

boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story
abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the
glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has
not been hastily done, or without considerable study.+For the Temple+: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem.With full-page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON.12mo, cloth, price

the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form
the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of
the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes
the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the
Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his
Galilean home with the favor of Titus.Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
     resistance to Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the
     famous wars of the world."--_Graphic._

     +Mopsa the Fairy.+ By JEAN INGELOW.Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living
     writers for children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of
     pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks.It
     requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of
     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._

adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by which he can
gain a livelihood.While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the
captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the
brig in order to gain the insurance.Once it is known he is in
possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island,
explaining to the crew that the boy is afflicted with leprosy.While
thus involuntarily playing the part of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck
submerged in the sand, and overhauling the timbers for the purpose of
gathering material with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount
of treasure.Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping
there a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to seize

distinct appreciation of the fact, feels a sense of weight, tenderness,
and oppression in the right hypochondrium, and experiences a painful
dragging from the right toward the left when turned on the left side.In some cases pain is felt in the shoulder, or, if not pain, a feeling
of weight.A slight icteroid hue of the conjunctiva, face, upper
extremities, and trunk is often present, but the stools are not wanting
in bile and the urine contains but little pigment--facts indicating
that the obstruction is limited to a small number of ducts.If the
jaundice is decided, the stools clay-, and the urine loaded with
pigment, a catarrhal swelling of the common or hepatic duct exists.As nutmeg liver is an incident in the course of the venous stasis from
cardiac or pulmonary obstructive disease, it is not unusual to find
ascites and general dropsy occur.When ascites precedes the other
manifestations of dropsy, and is relatively more important, the hepatic
congestion has led to atrophy of the cells and contraction of the
organ, or to cyanotic induration, as it has been designated in
contradistinction to cirrhotic induration.The subjects of hepatic congestion, especially of that form of the
malady due to gastro-intestinal irritation, are apt to experience no
little mental depression, even hypochondriasis, as, indeed, is usual in
most cases of hepatic disease.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The behavior of any case of
hyperaemia of the liver is determined, first, by the character of the
cause, and, secondly, by the extension of the mischief and the atrophic
changes which ensue.The congestion arising from gastro-intestinal
irritation is comparatively short-lived, since the causal conditions
may usually be promptly removed.It is far different in the cases due
to pulmonary or cardiac disease.If caused by a left pleuritic
exudation, the congestion will disappear as soon as the bend in the
ascending vena cava is removed by paracentesis.If, however, produced
by a permanent pulmonary obstruction, the course of the hepatic disease
is toward cyanotic induration.The same is true of obstructive cardiac
lesions.If compensation--as, for example, of a mitral
regurgitation--is not effected, the continual congestion must lead to
the ultimate lesions of the liver; but if compensation can be brought
about, the liver will be saved the irremediable {988} changes.The
prognosis, therapeutical and pathological, must necessarily be
dependent on the lesions of which the hyperaemia of the liver is merely
a symptom.DIAGNOSIS.--The decision in any case of hyperaemia of the liver must
rest on the determination of the gastro-intestinal, pulmonary, or
cardiac diseases causative.When, for example, to the gastro-intestinal
disturbance or cardiac disease there are added heaviness, uneasiness,
increased area of dulness of the right hypochondrium, a hyperaemia of
the liver may be concluded to exist.The extent to which the organ is
damaged may be judged from its size, the duration of the congestion,
and the character of the determining cause.If the area of hepatic
dulness declines steadily after having been increased, the causative
conditions continuing, the shrinking is due to atrophy.This view is
confirmed if ascites has appeared and increased out of proportion to
the general dropsy.TREATMENT.--Those cases of hyperaemia dependent on excesses in eating
and drinking require the substitution of a diet composed of lean meat,
skimmed milk, acid fruits, and such succulent vegetables as lettuce,
tomatoes, celery, etc.When there is a high degree of gastro-intestinal
catarrh, an absolute milk diet may be enforced with great advantage.enjoined in the section devoted to
lithaemia are equally applicable here.Amongst the special plans of
diet sometimes advocated in the condition of abdominal plethora or
portal congestion are the grape cure, the whey cure, etc.Great good is
accomplished by a simple diet and a course of the Saratoga saline
laxative waters--the Congress, Hathorn, Geyser, etc.The alkaline
waters of Wisconsin and Michigan, the White Sulphur of Virginia, and
others having similar properties in this country may be employed for
the same purpose.The saline laxatives, Pullna, Friedrichshall, and
other purgative salines, may be used in robust, plethoric subjects with
much portal congestion, hemorrhoids, etc.Phosphate of soda, given in
sufficient quantity to maintain a soluble state of the bowels, is also
a useful remedy.The resinous cathartics, podophyllin, jalap, rhubarb,
aloes, euonymin, iridin, baptisin, etc., are all useful when the
indication is to unload the portal circulation.The mercurials,
formerly so much used, are now discredited to an unwarranted degree.In
an irritable state of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane calomel in
small doses is remarkably useful.The treatment of congestion of the hepatic vein is included in that of
the lesion causing it.In some rather exceptional cases the liver
enlarges considerably in consequence of incompetence of the mitral,
without there being any other conspicuous evidence of the lesion.Remarkable relief is afforded to the hepatic symptoms by the
administration of digitalis.The important point in all cases due to
cardiac disease is to bring about compensation, and thus obviate the
consequences of the lesion.Remediable pulmonary affections should be
cured as promptly as possible, and the evil results of incurable
affections lessened by efforts to remove the hepatic hyperaemia.Careful alimentation, saline laxatives, and diuretics are the most
efficient measures.It would be encroaching on the subjects of
pulmonary and of cardiac diseases to enter more minutely into the
therapeutical questions connected with a symptom of these affections.DEFINITION.--By the term perihepatitis is meant an acute inflammation
of the serous envelope of the liver.It may be acute or chronic, very
rarely the latter, and it is usually a secondary affection, although
primary cases are not uncommon.PATHOGENY.--Inflammation of the hepatic portion of the peritoneum may
arise by an extension of the morbid process from neighboring parts, as
in perforation of the stomach or duodenum, pleuritis of that part of
the membrane reflected from the diaphragm, etc.More frequently it
arises by contiguity from some disease of the liver itself, as chronic
interstitial hepatitis, abscess, echinococci cysts, cancer, etc.The
author has frequently (comparatively) seen perihepatitis follow the
passage of gall-stones.It is usual to find considerable organized
exudation at the hilus of the liver in the case of those who have had
several attacks of hepatic colic, and attachments to various
neighboring parts also.In those instances of secondary hepatitis there
may be more or less extensive connective-tissue formation and
compression of the hepatic substance (Budd).[47]

[Footnote 47: _Diseases of the Liver_; also, Bamberger, _Krankheiten
des Chlylopoietic Systems_, p.Direct perihepatitis arises from traumatic causes--from contusions of
the right hypochondrium by spent balls, blows and falls, etc.Tight-lacing and wearing a strap to support the trousers are supposed
to excite a slow, chronic hepatitis, but the latter is more certain to
bring about such a result than the former.SYMPTOMS.--Acute perihepatitis, if of sufficient extent, causes more or
less fever; pain is felt in the right hypochondrium, and is increased
by pressure and by deep inspirations, and in some rare instances a
friction murmur is audible synchronous with the respiratory movements.These symptoms succeed to attacks of hepatic colic, perforation of the
stomach or intestine, and contusions of the abdominal wall.The chronic
form is not febrile; there is a feeling of soreness instead of acute
pain; pressure, the movements of the body, respiration, etc.increase
the distress, and on turning on the left side a painful dragging is
experienced.A slight degree of icterus may be present in both acute
and chronic cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of the acute cases is
toward recovery.In two or three days the inflammation reaches the
maximum, adhesions form, and then the morbid process declines.The
whole course of an acute perihepatitis caused by external injury or by
the passage of gall-stones is terminated in a week or ten days.The
mischief done may not be limited to the adhesions formed.The large
quantity of newly-organized connective tissue may, in its subsequent
contraction, compress the common, cystic, or hepatic duct, or the
portal, or both ducts and vein.The course of the chronic cases is
determined by the causative lesion.The contraction of the new-formed
connective tissue may compress the organ and lead to sclerotic changes
which cannot be distinguished from cirrhosis.In some instances
contusions set up suppurative inflammation, and an abscess forms
between the parietal and glandular layer of the peritoneum.Such a case
will then present the phenomena of hepatic abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the character of the case will be
{990} largely influenced by the history.If the attack has followed a
blow on the side or a paroxysm of hepatic colic or the symptoms of
perforation, there will be no difficulty in determining its seat and
character.In the absence of the history the differentiation must be
made between perihepatitis and pleuritis.The distinction consists in
the fact that in the former the pain and soreness are below the line of
respiratory sounds, although synchronous with them.In chronic
perihepatitis the symptoms come on in the course of the hepatic
disorder, or are consequent on a local injury, as the pressure of stays
or a band.TREATMENT.--If the symptoms are acute and the subject robust, the local
abstraction of blood by leeches affords relief and diminishes the
violence of the disease.A bandage should be tightly applied around the
body at the level of the hypochondrium to restrain the movements of the
affected organ.A turpentine stupe may be confined in this way, or a
compress of water may be utilized to serve the same purpose.If the
pain is acute and the peritonitis due to perforation or to the passage
of calculi, the hypodermatic injection of morphia is the most important
resource.Interstitial Hepatitis; Sclerosis of the Liver; Cirrhosis.DEFINITION.--The terms interstitial hepatitis and sclerosis of the
liver express the nature of the malady: they signify an inflammation of
the intervening connective tissue, resulting in a sclerosis--an
induration of the organ.The term cirrhosis, now so largely in use, was
originally proposed by Laennec[48] because of the yellowish tint of the
granulations, from the Greek word, [Greek: chirros], yellow.As
Laennec's theory of cirrhosis was erroneous, having regarded these
granulations as new formations, the word is a very faulty one, and
hence it would be preferable to use the term sclerosis, since a similar
change in other organs is thus designated, as sclerosis of the kidney,
sclerosis of the lungs, etc.It is also called in England gin-drinker's
liver, hobnail liver.Carswell[49] first described the anatomical
changes with accuracy, and illustrated them with correct drawings.The
following year Hallmann[50] confirmed the truth of Carswell's
descriptions, and contributed a good account of the morbid anatomy; and
subsequently French, German, and English authorities added new facts,
which will be set forth in the further discussion of the subject.[Footnote 48: _Traite de l'Auscultatlon mediate_, tome ii.[Footnote 49: _Illustrations of the Elementary Form of Diseases_,
fasciculus 10, plate 2.][Footnote 50: _De Cirrhosi hep._, Diss.Inaug., Berolini, 1839, quoted
by Thierfelder.]CAUSES.--Sclerosis of the liver is, conspicuously, a disease of adult
life and onward.Except the congenital example mentioned below, the
earliest age at which the disease has occurred, so far as I am able to
ascertain, is four years--a case reported by Wettergreen[51] of
hypertrophic sclerosis, in which neither a syphilitic nor paludal cause
could be ascertained.Cayley[52] reports a case in a child of six;
Murchison,[53] Frerichs,[54] Griffith,[55] one each at ten.After this
period the increase relatively to age is rapid.The majority of cases
occur between thirty {991} and fifty years.Yet Virchow[56] has given
the details of a congenital example.According to Forster, of 31 cases
of cirrhosis, 16 were between forty and sixty years.The preponderance
of cases in the male sex is very decided.Of Bamberger's 51 cases, 39
were men, 12 were women; of Frerichs' 36 cases, 20 occurred in men and
16 in women--a larger proportion of women than any other author
records; of 12 cases observed by myself, only 1 was a woman.Nationality does not affect the production of cirrhosis, except as
regards the personal habits of the people.This disease is
comparatively uncommon in wine- and beer-drinking countries, and
frequent amongst a spirit-drinking people.[57] The great etiological
factor is the abuse, the habitual use, of spirits, and hence the number
of cases observed in North Germany, England, Scotland, and the United
States.Murchison affirms that he has never seen a case produced in any
other way.Even in children of tender years the abuse of spirits can
usually be traced.Nevertheless, there are instances of the disease the
origin of which cannot be referred to alcoholic excess.The congenital
cases, as that narrated by Virchow, and the instances occurring in
children and adults not given to spirits in any form, indicate that
there are other pathogenetic influences which may bring about a
sclerosis of the liver.Virchow[58] was one of the first to illuminate
the subject of visceral syphilis and to demonstrate the occurrence of
sclerosis of the liver from syphilitic infection.Very often the
syphilitic cachexia coincides with alcoholic excess.There can be no
doubt that chronic malarial poisoning causes, or powerfully predisposes
to, cirrhosis.I have submitted elsewhere pathological evidence on this
point,[59] and the Italian physicians, who have the opportunity to
obtain accurate data, maintain that malarial toxaemia does bring about
this state.It is probable that the overgrowth of connective tissue is
induced by the repeated congestions of the malarial attacks, and by the
obstruction due to catarrh of the bile-ducts which so often occurs in
the febrile paroxysms.[Footnote 51: _Hygeia_, 1880, quoted by _London Medical Record_, March
15, 1881.][Footnote 52: _Transactions of the Path.[Footnote 53: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 54: _Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.[Footnote 55: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 56: _Archiv f. path.[Footnote 57: Baer, _Der Alcoholismus_, Berlin, 1878, p.62 _et seq._]

[Footnote 58: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.281; also, Lancereaux, _A
Treatise on Syphilis_, Syd.[Footnote 59: _Memoirs of the Sanitary Commission_, medical volume.]J. Wickham Legg[60] and Charcot[61] nearly simultaneously discovered
that obstruction of the bile-ducts, if continued a sufficient length of
time, sets up a hyperplasia of the connective tissue of the liver.Thus, Legg has seen a liver
markedly cirrhotic in a case where a small cancer of the duodenum
completely obstructed the flow of bile into the intestine.[62] By tying
the common duct in dogs it was found that a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue very soon occurred, and this was followed, of course,
by contraction of the new tissue and atrophy of the hepatic cells.Closure of the hepatic vein has the same effect, and also, as
Solowieff[63] has asserted, closure of the portal vein; on the other
hand, by Frerichs and others the closure of the portal is attributed to
the sclerosis.[Footnote 60: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.351 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 61: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.231 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 62: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.Anat., etc._, Band lxii.Certain poisons, as antimony, arsenic, notably phosphorus, have the
power to set up an irritative hyperplasia of the connective tissue of
the {992} liver.These metals accumulate in the liver in preparation
for excretion.Wegner,[64] in the study of the action of phosphorus on
dogs, rabbits, and other animals, has induced a marked degree of
sclerosis, but such results have not been observed in cases of
poisoning by phosphorus in man, except in an instance reported by
Kussner.[Footnote 64: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lv.Finally, a condition of the liver corresponding in all respects to
cirrhosis has been induced by perihepatitis, by the organization of the
exudation and its subsequent contraction, and by the extension of the
morbid process from the capsule to the interlobular connective tissue
(Poulin[65]).[Footnote 65: _Etude sur les Atrophies viscerales consecutives aux
Inflammations chroniques du Sereuses, etc._, These de Paris, 1880.]PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Several forms of cirrhosis are recognized by the
modern French school of pathologists.According to Sabourin,[66] there
is an annular, a monolobular, and a multilobular form.These differ
merely in regard to the arrangement of the new connective tissue.At
the outset of the disease the liver is increased in size and
hyperaemic.The outer
surface is at this period smooth, but on section the islets of the
parenchymatous tissue, yellowish in color, are distinctly visible
between the grayish or pale-rose tint of the intervening or
proliferating tissue.This reddish-gray material consists of fine
connective-tissue elements containing spindle-shaped cells.[67] The
development of this material is such as to even exceed in quantity the
proper glandular structure.The bands of newly-formed connective tissue
extend between individual lobules (monolobular cirrhosis) or between
groups of lobules (multilobular cirrhosis).A portion of the
spindle-shaped cells form new vessels communicating with the branches
of the hepatic artery.[68] Coincidently with the formation of the new
connective tissue ensues its contraction.The enlarged organ diminishes
in size from a slight degree to one-half its original volume;
especially in the left lobe is the diminution of size most marked.On
the surface it exhibits a knobbed or nodular aspect (hobnail liver),
and these knobs present through the capsule a yellow appearance.The
granulations, so called, consist of small prominences corresponding to
lobules or groups of lobules, and hence vary in size from that of a
pinhead to that of a pea.[69] Between these are the sharply-defined
masses of connective tissue.On section the organ is found to be of
firm almost cartilaginous hardness, and between the interlacing bundles
of connective tissue are the small islands of parenchymatous tissue
projecting above the cut surface and having a yellowish or
brownish-yellow color.As the terminal branches of the portal are
compressed in the process of shrinking undergone by the new connective
tissue, they are destroyed.The result of this obliteration of the
portal radicles is the impaired nutrition of the lobules and atrophy of
the cells.Formerly it was held that the atrophy of the hepatic cells
was due to the compression exercised by the contracting connective
tissue, and Beale[70] even maintained that the change began in {993}
the cells, the connective tissue contracting as the cells receded
before them.This view has been reaffirmed by Ackermann in a paper read
last year before the Congress of German Naturalists and Physicians, but
without any acknowledgment, so far as I can ascertain, of Beale's
long-before expressed opinions.In the discussion which followed the
reading of Ackermann's paper the position of its author was supported
by Aufrecht, Kussner, and others, but controverted by Rindfleisch.It
has been demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten[71] that the lobule is
nourished not only by the portal radicles, but by the branches of the
hepatic artery, which enter, by the interlobular vein, the capillaries
of the lobule, and hence the nutrition of the cells suffers in
consequence of the lessened blood-supply; but it is probable also that
more or less compression is exercised.When the cells are destroyed,
their remains may be discerned in the mass of connective tissue as fine
fat-granules or masses of pigment yellowish or brownish in color.The
peculiar appearance to which the name cirrhosis is applied is due to
the lobules or groups of lobules which project on section above the
divided surface, and are  yellowish by the bile-pigment, which
here exists in an exaggerated quantity.The cells themselves are not
normal: they are enlarged by compensatory hypertrophy, and they contain
much bile-pigment and a considerable quantity of fat.The compression
of the capillaries, especially their obliteration, leads to stasis of
the blood and its consequences in the whole chylopoietic system.Sabourin, "Du Role que joue le Systeme veineux

_et seq._]

SYMPTOMS.--The development of sclerosis is usually very insidious.After some years' indulgence in spirit-drinking or affected for a
length of time with the other causes of the malady, a gradual decline
of vigor occurs.The complexion takes on a fawn color, stigmata slowly
form on the face, there is more or less yellowness of the conjunctiva,
and attacks of headache, giddiness, and even severe vertigo, are
experienced.An increasing indisposition to mental effort, some
hebetude of mind, and a gradually deepening despondency are felt.The
appetite gradually fails, becomes capricious, and only highly-seasoned,
rather odd, or unusual articles of food can be taken.Such subjects
acquire a taste for condiments, for such uncooked vegetables as onions,
celery, raw cabbage, etc., for fruits, and get a distaste for
plainly-cooked meats and vegetables, for sweets, etc.The digestion is
as capricious as the appetite: at first there are times of appetite,
again of indifference, then of disgust; some heaviness is felt after
meals; gaseous eructations, acidity, pyrosis, nausea, occur day after
day as the case advances; and ultimately morning vomiting is regularly
experienced.Nausea is felt on rising; then with much straining and
distress a little glairy mucus and a teaspoonful of bile are brought
up; after which, it may be, a little food can be taken.It is only
after the case is fully declared that these troubles of stomach
digestion become constant; previously they occur now and then in a
paroxysmal way, whilst between there is only labored digestion.As the compression of the portal radicles maintains, by reason of the
obstruction, a constant hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous membrane, a
catarrhal state, with fermentation of the fatty, starchy, and
saccharine constituents of the food, and hence complicated products of
an irritating kind, must result therefrom.Hemorrhoids, varying in size
according to {994} the degree of obstruction, form, sometimes bleeding
more or less profusely, again being merely troublesome or painful.Fissures of the anus and fistula in ano not unfrequently complicate the
case.The bowels are necessarily rather relaxed than confined, but at
the onset of the malady they may be confined, afterward assuming more
or less of the characteristics of diarrhoea.The stools may be
offensive with the products of decomposition, rather clay- or
golden, or brownish and almost black from the presence of blood.In
some cases the stools are parti---clay- in part, brownish
in part--and in exceptional examples continue normal or nearly so until
near the end.As the transudations from the portal vessels increase,
the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal becomes oedematous, and,
the normal secretions being arrested, the discharges finally consist of
a watery fluid, whitish or grayish, dark-brown or blackish, and very
offensive.The decomposition of foods instead of their proper digestion
and solution, and especially the fermentation of the starchy and
saccharine constituents of the aliment taken, produce a great quantity
of gas; hence meteorism comes to be an ordinary symptom.The
accumulation of gas is greatly promoted by the paretic state of the
muscular layer and by the relaxation of the abdominal walls consequent
on the oedema of the muscular tissue.A high degree of distress is
sometimes caused by the great accumulation of flatus; the abdomen is
greatly distended and the diaphragm is pushed up against the heart and
lungs, compelling the patient at length to sit up to breathe with ease.Of course the accumulation of fluid may be greater, and the gas only
add to the discomfort.Sometimes it happens, indeed, that
this is the only evidence of the portal obstruction at first observed.Haematemesis is more common than intestinal hemorrhage.Now the blood
may be large in quantity, appear little changed from its usual
coagulated state, and be brought up promptly with slight effort of
vomiting; now it is passed by stool, is in coffee-, granular
masses or in a tar-like, semifluid state; and again it appears in
coffee-grounds mixed with the contents of the stomach.These variations
are due to the character, seat, and extent of the hemorrhage and to the
condition of the mucous membrane.Merely-distended capillaries,
yielding, may furnish a little blood, which, acted on by the gastric
juice, forms coffee-grounds, or, if not acted on in consequence of the
failure of the gastric glands to functionate, appears as bloody streaks
mixed with mucus.Enlarged veins, giving way, may furnish a large
quantity of partly-coagulated venous blood, charred or not as the state
of the juices will determine.In some cases hemorrhages into the
submucous tissue or thromboses of the submucous veins lead to solution
of the membrane thus deprived of its nutritional supply, and ulcers
form.Two admirable examples of this kind have been seen by the writer
in which large haematemesis occurred from ulcers near the pylorus.They
were round, smooth ulcers, containing coagula, and the eroded vessels
(veins) were readily seen opening into the cavity of each.The obstruction to the portal circulation results also in an
enlargement of the spleen.There may be a simple enlargement due to the
hyperaemia merely; there may be an enlargement due to the hyperaemia
and to a resulting hyperplasia of the connective tissue; there may be
also, in {995} addition to the second form of enlargement, amyloid
degeneration, syphilitic hyperplasia, etc.The increased dimensions of
the spleen are by no means always made out, and authorities differ
greatly as to the proportion of cases in which the enlargement can be
detected.The organ may indeed be considerably enlarged whilst pushed
upward into the left hypochondrium by the effusion, and yet the attempt
to measure and define its dimensions may be fruitless.From a slight
increase due to the hyperaemia up to the enormous dimensions acquired
by the added amyloid material there are all possible variations in
size.Partly in consequence of the increased blood-pressure in the vessels of
the peritoneum, and partly in consequence of the watery condition of
the blood itself, effusion takes place into the sac of the peritoneum.Such an accumulation is known as ascites, or dropsy of the abdomen.The
time at which the effusion begins, the amount of it, and the degree of
contraction of the liver necessary to produce it, vary in each case.Ascites may be the first symptom to announce the onset of cirrhosis; it
is more frequently amongst the later symptoms, and is the evidence of
much interference in the portal circulation.However, it is not due
wholly to hepatic disease.The blood in cirrhosis is much reduced and
watery, hence slight causes suffice to induce an outward diffusion.Given a certain obstacle to the passage of the blood through the liver,
transudation will be the more prompt to appear the greater the anaemia.In some cases an enormous quantity of fluid collects: from ten to
thirty pounds may be regarded as usual, and forty to sixty pounds as
exceptional, although the highest amount just given is not rare.The
fluid of ascites nearly represents the serum of the blood.It has a
straw color and is clear, but it may have a reddish tint from the
presence of blood, a greenish-yellow or brown from bile-pigment.The
solids of the serum are in the proportion of from 1 to 3 per cent., and
consist of albumen chiefly and salts, of which sodium chloride is the
principal.Hoppe's[72] analysis gives this result: 1.55 to 1.75 solids,
of which 0.62 to 0.77 is albumen.According to Frerichs, the amounts of
solids ranges from 2.04 to 2.48, and of these albumen constitutes 1.01
to 1.34.[Footnote 72: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band ix.]Oedema of the inferior extremities comes on after, usually--rarely
with--the ascites.If the mechanism of this oedematous swelling be as
supposed, the effusion into the areolar tissue necessarily succeeds to
the abdominal effusion.The pressure of the fluid in the cavity on the
ascending vena cava and iliac veins seems to be the principal factor;
but to this must also be added the intestinal gas, which in some
instances exerts a powerful force.The ankles have in rather rare cases
appeared swollen before the abdomen, but the detection of fluid in the
peritoneal cavity when in small quantity is not always easy.Obese
women, with much accumulation of fat in the omentum and flatus in the
intestines, have swollen feet and legs if erect for some time, the
effusion being due to pressure on the vena cava.The legs may become
enormously distended.The scrotum and penis in the male, the vulva in
the female, the buttocks and the abdominal wall, also become
oedematous, sometimes immensely.Warmth and moisture and the friction of the sensitive surfaces excite
vesicular and pustular eruptions where the {996} scrotum and labiae
come in contact with the thighs.Urination may be impeded by the oedema
of the prepuce.An attempt at compensation for these evils growing out of the
obstruction in the portal system is made by the natural powers.Anastomoses of veins through minute branches are made use of to convey
the blood of the obstructed portal circulation into the general venous
system, and to this end become greatly enlarged.The interlobular veins
being obliterated by the contracting connective tissue, the pressure in
the branches and trunk of the portal vein is much increased.Hence an
outlet is sought for in the veins which communicate between the portal
and the ascending vena cava.One of the most important of these is a
vein in the round ligament, at one time supposed to be the closed
umbilical vein, but proved by Sappey to be an accessory portal vein.Bamberger,[73] however, has found the umbilical vein pervious, and
since, Hoffmann[74] has demonstrated the same fact.It is probable,
indeed, that Sappey's observation is correct for some cases.In either
event, the veins of the abdominal wall about the umbilicus
communicating with the epigastric become enormously distended, and in
some advanced cases of cirrhosis form a circle known as the caput
Medusae.Further communication between the portal and the veins of the
diaphragm takes place by means of the veins in the coronary and
suspensory ligaments.In some instances a new route is established
between the veins of the diaphragm and the portal by means of new
vessels formed in the organized connective tissue resulting from
perihepatitis.Still another channel of communication exists between
the inferior oesophageal veins, the azygos, and the coronary, and
finally between the inferior hemorrhoidal and the hypogastric.The more
completely can communication be established between these anastomosing
veins the less severe the results of portal obstruction.[Footnote 73: _Krankheiten des Chylopoiet.cit._]

[Footnote 74: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

Besides these indirect evidences of portal obstruction and a
contracting organ, there are direct means of ascertaining the condition
of the liver.By the methods of physical diagnosis we may acquire much
information.On auscultation, as our Jackson[75] was the first to show,
a grating or creaking like leather, or friction sound, is audible over
the right hypochondrium synchronously with the respiratory movements or
when produced by moving with the fingers the abdominal wall on the
liver.This sound is caused by the bands of false membrane which extend
between the two surfaces, and hence indicates a secondary
perihepatitis.[Footnote 75: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850.]To ascertain the dimensions of the liver--to mark out the area of
hepatic dulness--with accuracy is a most necessary procedure.The
period of the disease is an important element in the problem.When the
new material is deposited and the congestion of the portal system first
occurs, an increase in the dimensions of the organ is observed.This
enlargement, of brief duration, must not be confounded with the
hypertrophic sclerosis, another form of the malady.So considerable is
the increase in the size of the liver that there is an evident
enlargement of the right hypochondrium, and the whole abdomen seems
fuller.The organ may be felt, on palpation, projecting one, two, or
even three fingers' breadths below the margin of the ribs, and the left
lobe extends well across the epigastrium, increasing the sense of
resistance and the area {997} of dulness in this direction.The
enlarged liver, as felt below the ribs, appears firmer than is natural,
is yet smooth, and the margin is sharply defined.The duration of this
period of enlargement is indefinite, but it is rather brief, and is
followed by the contracting and atrophic stage.It is not often,
indeed, that the patient presents himself during the period of
enlargement.Sometimes a perihepatitis or an unwonted tenderness in the
right side compels attention during this stage, but more frequently it
escapes notice.If perihepatitis occur, there will be fever, pain, and
tenderness, a slight icterode hue of the skin, and possibly
Jackson's[76] friction sound.These symptoms, taken in conjunction with
the history of the case and the obvious enlargement of the organ, will
indicate the existence of the first stage of sclerosis.[Footnote 76: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850, _supra_.]The contraction of the liver, or, as it may be expressed, the atrophy
of the hepatic cells and the consequent shrinking of the interlobular
connective tissue, goes on slowly.Several months may be occupied in an
amount of atrophy distinct enough to be recognized by the narrowing of
the area of hepatic dulness.Especially difficult is the recognition of
the contraction when ascites has fully distended the abdomen.It may be
necessary under such circumstances to postpone a decision until tapping
has removed the fluid.If the organ can be felt by depressing the walls
of the abdomen, more or less unevenness of surface may be detected, and
the inferior margin may give the impression of hardness and sharpness
of outline.At the same time, the increased dulness of the epigastric
region observed during the hypertrophic stage will have gradually
ceased because of the shrinking of the left lobe.The liver may be
undergoing the atrophic degeneration to a marked extent and yet remain
large--larger even than normal.Such a state of things may be due to
conjoint amyloid or fatty degeneration of the organ, and, indeed, more
or less fatty change occurs in all cases of cirrhosis.The shrinking of
the liver persists until the area of dulness is not greater in area
than two or three ribs.The disturbances of function in sclerosis of the liver are not limited
to the chylopoietic system.As the secreting structure of the liver is
continually lessened in extent by the atrophy, symptoms result from the
necessary interference in the hepatic functions.These symptoms are
concerned with the liver, with the nutrition of the tissues of the
body, and with the kidneys.As regards the biliary function of the
liver, the quantity of bile acids and pigment is reduced below the
normal in proportion to the damage done to the organ.As a rule, there
is little jaundice in sclerosis, and very little bile-pigment present
in the urine.Instead of a
jaundiced hue of the skin, it has a fawn color--an earthy, sallow tint
eminently characteristic of a chronic affection in which the power to
produce bile is much impaired.Occasionally it happens, particularly in
the early stages of cirrhosis, that a well-marked jaundice appears in
the face and body, but this probably is due to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.In most cases the integument presents the earthy and sallow
hue above mentioned.Graves[77] appears to have been the first to
interpret aright the greater significance of this appearance of the
skin than the purely jaundiced tint.The glycogenic {998} function of
the liver must be impaired in the same ratio as the biliary.The
nutrition of the body suffers; the skin becomes dry and harsh; the fat
disappears; the temperature of the body, unless the conditions for
producing fever are present, is barely up to normal, if not somewhat
below; a marked degree of anaemia supervenes; and the action of the
heart becomes feeble and rapid after a period of slowness.The blood is
altered in quality, and hence hemorrhages--epistaxis especially--occur,
petechiae and ecchymoses appear in the skin, and stigmata are numerous
about the face and nose.[Footnote 77: _Clinical Medicine_, _op.cit._]

The urine in cirrhosis is high- because of the abundance of
pigment, and in the early stages of the disease is increased in amount,
although of lower specific gravity.When much effusion takes place into
the peritoneal sac, the compression of the renal veins by the fluid
lessens the activity of the kidneys and diminishes the urinary flow.Much discussion has taken place over the quantity of urea present in
the urine in cases of cirrhosis, but it has been established that the
relative quantity of urea lessens in proportion to the damage suffered
by the liver.[78] The urates are in excess.[Footnote 78: Charcot, _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, _loc.252; also, _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree dans les Maladies du
Foie_, par F. Genevoix, Paris, 1876; _Des Rapports de l'Uree avec le
Foie_, par A. Martin, Paris, 1877; _Sur l'Uree et ces Variations dans
la Cirrhose_, These de Paris, Audiguier; _Contribution a l'Etude du
Role du Foie dans la Product.de l'Uree_, Reufflet.]COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--There are enormous variations in
the course of the disease as respects the rate of its progress.In
general, it may be said that the whole duration is from three months to
six years.The onset is often insidious, and little distress is
occasioned until effusion begins in the abdomen.In other cases there
is considerable pain in the right hypochondrium, severe disorders of
digestion and intestinal derangements, rapid emaciation, ascites, and
some intercurrent malady which terminates them, often quite
unexpectedly.The usual course is as follows: After the protracted use
of alcoholic stimulants the symptoms of gastro-intestinal catarrh
appear; there occur acidity, pyrosis, morning vomiting, and distress
after meals; the bowels are irregular, the stools rather dark and
offensive; the bodily vigor declines and the mental condition is
depressed and hypochondriacal; emaciation progresses; the skin becomes
dry, harsh, and fawn-; stigmata appear on the face; some
uneasiness is felt in the abdomen, through the right hypochondrium, and
about the umbilicus; presently the abdomen enlarges and the feet and
legs swell; after a time the abdominal enlargement is extreme and the
walls become thin, the genitals and thighs are greatly distended, and
the prepuce is so swollen that urination grows more and more difficult,
the penis almost disappearing in the surrounding oedema;
notwithstanding the immense size of the abdomen and lower extremities,
the chest, face, and upper extremities are wasted away; to lie down is
impossible, and only snatches of disturbed sleep are procured in the
upright sitting posture; breathing grows more and more difficult, and a
sense of suffocation is imminent; and, thus worn out by suffering and
want of sleep, the patient at last sinks into a soporose state and dies
comatose, if not cut off before by some acute serous
inflammation--pleuritis, peritonitis, peri- or endocarditis, pneumonia,
etc.{999} The course of any case of cirrhosis is much influenced by the
amount of damage to the hepatic cells and by the extent of the
compensatory changes in the circulation.Ulcers of the stomach or
intestine, opening vessels, or hemorrhages from the mucous membranes
may have a pronounced effect on the progress of any case.A fatal
result was determined in a case under the writer's charge by hemorrhage
from ulcers near the pylorus, which were caused by thromboses of the
stomach veins at that point.Occasionally, the occurrence of thrombosis
of the portal vein adds an embarrassing and dangerous complication.The
liver, besides the change due to cirrhosis, may be affected by amyloid
or fatty degeneration, or by both combined.It should not be forgotten
that more or less fatty change takes place in the hepatic cells
undergoing atrophy, whence the appearance called cirrhosis.Sclerosis
may be a general condition in which several organs participate, the
kidneys notably.These organs are changed by a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue, and especially by fatty degeneration of the
epithelium.In the brain the sclerosis consists in chronic
pachymeningitis, adhesions of the dura, etc., and with these
connective-tissue changes are often associated extravasations of blood.These lesions are probably due to chronic alcoholism rather than to the
cirrhosis--are simultaneous lesions, instead of consecutive.The duration of cirrhosis must necessarily depend largely on the
occurrence of the complications above mentioned and on the appearance
of intercurrent diseases.The most usual intercurrent maladies are
peritonitis, pleuritis, and other serous inflammations.An attack of
cerebral (meningeal) hemorrhage may occur.Failure of the heart may be
due to fatty degeneration of its muscular tissue.Stupor, coma, and
insensibility may come on toward the close in consequence of the
retention of excrementitious matters.By Flint, Jr., these cerebral
symptoms were referred to the retained cholesterin, and hence he
designated this state cholesteraemia.Numerous experimentalists
(Pages,[79] Chomjakow,[80] Von Krusenstern,[81] Koloman Muller[82])
have studied this question, and only Muller has been able to confirm
Flint's theory.The condition is more suitably designated cholaemia,
which signifies blood-poisoning from the excrementitious biliary
matters retained in the system.[Footnote 79: Quoted by Legg, p.[Footnote 80: Quoted by Krusenstern.][Footnote 81: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxv.[Footnote 82: _Archiv fur experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie_,
Band i. p.Any fully-developed case of cirrhosis can only terminate in one way,
for we possess no means of restoring the hepatic cells when once
destroyed.At the outset of the disease, before any serious changes
have taken place, it is probable it may be arrested.Proceeding to its
natural termination without complications or intercurrent affections,
death finally occurs from exhaustion.The emaciation becomes extreme,
the stomach gets to be excessively irritable, and an exhausting
diarrhoea consumes the last remains of strength.Then an oedema of the
lungs or failure of the heart or a deep coma ends the scene.DIAGNOSIS.--Cirrhosis in its first stage is to be distinguished from
diseases which cause enlargement of the liver, and in its second or
contracting stage from diseases that induce contraction of the organ.The history of alcoholic excess is an important means of
differentiating this {1000} from other affections.The enlargement
belonging to alcoholism is distinguished from that due to amyloid
disease by the permanent character of the latter and by its history of
chronic suppuration, in addition to, it may be, alcoholic excess; from
cancer, by the character of the enlargement, by its permanence, by the
secondary deposits in the mesentery and elsewhere, by the severe and
persistent pain; from hydatids or echinococci cysts by the painless
enlargement of the latter, by the absence, usually, of any interference
with the hepatic functions, by the purring thrill, and by the presence
of the characteristic hooklets in the fluid withdrawn.From the
maladies characterized by the contraction of the organ it is
distinguished by the rapidity with which the case is developed in acute
yellow atrophy, and by the profound constitutional disturbance
characteristic of this form of contraction.When the liver is lessened
in size in consequence of the compression exercised by the contracting
exudation of a local peritonitis, there is a history of pain and
soreness of the right hypochondrium, followed by the symptoms of
contraction--a very different history from that of cirrhosis, in which
the local attacks of pain and distress succeed to or accompany the
symptoms of contraction.Occlusion of the gall-ducts by a calculus may
set up a slow atrophy having some points of resemblance to cirrhosis;
but in this malady attacks of hepatic colic precede the signs of
obstruction, the jaundice, and gray evacuations, and the evidences of
contraction succeed to these very characteristic symptoms; whereas in
cirrhosis paroxysms of pain followed by jaundice are not known.Occlusion of the portal vein may also be followed by atrophy, but this
is usually due to some other affection of the abdominal organs, and the
change in the condition of the liver occurs very promptly, there being
neither the history nor the course of symptoms belonging to cirrhosis.TREATMENT.--As the abuse of alcoholic liquors--even their habitual use
in moderation--is the chief pathogenetic factor, they should be
entirely given up.Condiments, coffee and tea, highly-seasoned animal
foods, are of less importance as causes, but are sufficiently injurious
to require them to be discontinued.The food of such subjects should
not contain fat, because the bile is necessary to its right
assimilation, and should have but a small proportion relatively of
starch and sugar, since these articles readily ferment in the presence
of an excess of mucus and in the absence of the bile.The succulent
vegetables, as lettuce, celery, spinach, etc., should be substituted
for the starchy and saccharine.A diet largely composed of skimmed milk
renders an important service both as a nutrient and a diuretic and
depurant.Lean meats, acid fruits, and the weak alkaline mineral waters
should be the basis of a proper system of alimentation.As malarial intoxication is a cause now distinctly recognized, patients
should be removed from such influences.If this be impracticable, the
effects of the poison should, as far as possible, be removed,
especially the glandular complications.To this end, such remedies
should be employed as will affect the overgrowth of the connective
tissue, as the compound solution of iodine, the bichloride of mercury,
and the chloride of gold (or gold and sodium).Quinine will be
necessary, according to circumstances.Do we possess any means to check the overgrowth of connective tissue
{1001} in cases of sclerosis?The writer believes that those remedies
have this power to a less or greater extent which are separated by the
liver from the blood.These are chiefly the salts of gold, silver,
copper, arsenic, and mercury (chloride), and phosphorus.The most
useful of these are the chloride of gold and sodium and the chloride of
mercury, and some phosphates.The writer has had, he thinks, curative
results in the commencement of the disease from the chloride of gold
and sodium and the phosphate of sodium.German practitioners believe
that the chloride of ammonium is a powerful alterant and deobstruent,
and prescribe it in this affection to stop the overgrowth of connective
tissue.That it does have this effect can hardly be disputed, but the
daily quantity necessary is large, the taste very disagreeable, and the
stomachal effect that of an irritant.Hence it is by no means so
effective as the chlorides above mentioned.The chloride of gold and
sodium (1/10 grain) can be given at the same time with chloride of
mercury (1/20 grain) if it is desirable to combine their effects.The
writer has seen what appeared to be cases of cirrhosis in the first
stage yield to the persistent administration of phosphate of
sodium--drachm j ter in die--and the chloride of gold and sodium.When contraction of the liver has ensued, and hemorrhages, effusion
into the cavity of the peritoneum, and a high degree of
gastro-intestinal catarrh have occurred, the relief of the secondary
symptoms takes the first place in importance.There are but three modes
by which an effusion into the abdomen can be removed: by the skin, by
the kidneys, by the intestinal canal.Each of these may be employed in
turn.By the skin warm baths, vapor baths, digitalis stupes, and
especially the subcutaneous injection of pilocarpin, may be employed.These alone may be sufficient in some cases--rather rarely, however.They may all be used simultaneously or in turn to effect the purpose.A
digitalis stupe may be made to have the effect of a vapor bath: a large
one is placed on the abdomen and the body is covered with blankets,
which results in the production of abundant sweating.The vapor bath is
applied in the ordinary way, so that no explanation is needed.If there
be no contraindication in the state of the heart, pilocarpin salts can
be injected in sufficient quantity to induce active diaphoresis.These
measures proving inadequate, an attempt should be made to dispose of
the fluid by acting on the kidneys and promoting diuresis.Amongst the
diuretics in ascites, Wilks places the resin of copaiba first.The dose
ranges from two to five grains, and it may be given in combination with
gold or mercury chloride.When this remedy increases the flow of urine,
it does good, but if the quantity of urine remains unchanged, it does
no good, and should be discontinued.As the effusion of fluid is due to the portal obstruction, it follows
that depletion of the terminal radicles of this system will act most
directly on the origin of the troubles.Hydragogue cathartics have,
therefore, an important place in the treatment of ascites of hepatic
origin.One of the most generally efficient of these remedies is the
compound jalap powder, for whilst it produces free watery evacuations,
it also stimulates the kidneys somewhat.It is generally better to give
a full dose--one or two teaspoonfuls--in the early morning, so that the
disturbance caused by it will subside before the time for taking food.Several free watery evacuations should be produced by it.Sometimes the
resin or extract of podophyllin is added to the compound jalap powder
to increase its activity.{1002} Purgative combinations of colocynth,
gamboge, and resin of podophyllin are also occasionally employed, but
the most efficient hydragogue is elaterium.The last-mentioned may act
very efficiently without causing any considerable depression, but the
results obtained by it are usually fleeting.After even a very free
discharge of fluid the effusion quickly increases, and further
purgation is required.Tapping is a palliative expedient which must
sometimes be considered.With the present improved aspirator and the
antiseptic method the fluid may be withdrawn with ease and safety.It
is not necessary in any case to remove all the fluid--merely that
quantity which will relieve the pressure on the diaphragm and on the
renal vessels.The author has seen general peritonitis result from
tapping.As such a complication will increase all the difficulties of a
case, it is very desirable to prevent it by careful application of the
antiseptic method and sealing of the punctured orifice to prevent the
entrance of germs.In the protracted cases of cirrhosis there ensues, finally, a highly
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane, the bowels become very
irritable, and frequent offensive and watery discharges occur.If under
these circumstances the abdominal effusion increases, the remedies must
consist of diuretics and diaphoretics rather than purgatives.Indeed,
an exhaustive colliquative diarrhoea may require bismuth, copper, and
other astringents, combined with opium, to prevent the patient passing
into the condition of collapse.Hemorrhage by vomiting or by stool will
demand ice, subsulphate of iron, ipecac, ergotin in the form of
subcutaneous injection especially, and other remedies which have been
found useful in gastric or intestinal hemorrhage.Topical remedies are not without utility if used early.When the
changes in the liver are secondary to peritonitis of the hepatic
portion, the application of leeches and cups renders an important
service.At any time during the course of cirrhosis wet or dry cups may
be used with advantage whenever local pain, tenderness, and a catching
respiration indicate the extension of mischief to the peritoneum.The
tincture of iodine or flying blisters, or both in turn, may be applied
over the right hypochondrium after cups and leeches, or at any time
when local distress indicates the need of counter-irritants.Probably
the most efficient topical application during the hypertrophic stage of
cirrhosis is the official ung.A piece the size
of a large pea should be thoroughly rubbed in over the hepatic region
daily until some irritation of the skin is produced.When this
irritation has subsided the applications should be renewed.Suppurative Hepatitis; Abscess of the Liver.DEFINITION.--Suppurative hepatitis is an acute inflammation of the
hepatic parenchyma, terminating in suppuration.The inflammation may be
primary or due to local conditions entirely, or it may arise from
morbid processes occurring in parts or organs in anatomical relation to
the liver.CAUSES.--Climate exercises an unquestionable influence in the
production of hepatic abscess.Those warm countries visited by
dysentery, {1003} says Lombard,[83] are almost exclusively affected by
this disease.Hirsch,[84] whilst recognizing the influence of climate,
shows that the natives are not affected to the same extent as are
Europeans.Both writers maintain that hepatic abscess does not occur
frequently in the corresponding parallels of latitude in the United
States; which is true of the Atlantic border, but is not correct for
the interior continent, the valley of the Mississippi, and its
tributaries.In this vast region the conditions for the production of
hepatitis exist abundantly.The mean annual temperature, the
malaria-breeding soil, the social and personal habits of the people
(males), combine to favor the production of hepatic abscess.As the
native population and females in tropical countries are not affected,
there must be other influences to the action of which the high
temperature contributes.The rich and highly-seasoned food in which
Europeans indulge and the large consumption of alcoholic drinks are
doubtless responsible in a large measure for the occurrence of this
malady in such excessive proportions amongst them.[Footnote 83: _Traite de Climatologie medicale_, tome iv.[Footnote 84: _Handbuch der historisch-geographischen Pathologie_, Band
ii.Sex has a remarkable influence in securing immunity against hepatic
abscess.According to the statistics of Rouis,[85] of 258 cases of
hepatic abscess, only 8 were in women.He rightly enough attributes
this exemption rather to the difference in habits of the two sexes than
to any merely sexual peculiarity.In 12 cases observed by the writer,
only 1 was in a woman.In Waring's[86] collection of 300 fatal cases of
tropical dysentery, only 9 occurred in women.These facts are most
conclusive regarding the relatively greater frequency of the affection
in men.As might be expected, the age at which this disease occurs is
the period of adult life, when exposure to the conditions developing it
is most likely to happen.In general, then, hepatic abscess may be
referred to the period mentioned by Rouis--from twelve to seventy-five
years of age.In my own cases the youngest was eleven years and the
oldest fifty-four years of age.It is not the broken-down subject of
mature age or the weakling of youth who is attacked by hepatic abscess,
but the more vigorous and able-bodied, who have, because of their
strength and activity, been exposed to the manifold conditions
producing it.[Footnote 85: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie
d'apres des Observations recueilles dans le Nord de l'Afrique_, par J.
L. Rouis, Paris, 1860, p.[Footnote 86: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology of Some
Points connected with Abscess of the Liver_, by Ed.John Waring,
Resident Surgeon of Travancore, 1854, p.Rouis finds that a combination of the lymphatic and nervous
temperaments seems most favorable to the production of this malady.It
is certain that those who have the bodily conditions influential in the
formation of gall-stones are not unfrequently attacked by abscess.The
passage of the calculi may induce a local peritonitis of considerable
severity; their arrest in the duct, with the result of ulcerating
through, producing peritonitis and adhesions, are conditions
eventuating in the formation of an abscess always large and sometimes
of enormous size.Under such circumstances the element of temperament
has a secondary place in the aggregate of causes.Not very often hepatic abscess results from external blows, contusions,
and from penetrating wounds.The liver is so placed as to glide aside
when a blow is inflicted on the right hypochondrium, and thus escapes
{1004} direct compression.An injury which elsewhere would have but
little effect may excite suppurative inflammation in the tropical--or,
as it may be entitled, the hepatic--abscess zone.Climatic conditions,
or the changed habits of Europeans in tropical and subtropical regions,
exert a distinct influence in traumatic cases.The most important causes of hepatic abscess exist in the state of the
portal vein, hepatic artery, and the hepatic veins.In the valley of
the Mississippi and its tributaries, where abscess of the liver is a
comparatively common disease, it has been found that in a large
proportion of the cases the initial stage is an affection of the
rectum--a form of dysentery properly entitled proctitis.So far as this
vast region is concerned, the intestinal disease which precedes abscess
of the liver, and stands in a causative relation to it, is an affection
of the mucous membrane from which the inferior hemorrhoidal veins
arise.This disease, although having a dysenteric form, is not ordinary
dysentery.The onset of the disease and its symptomatic expression are
those of a mild affection of the mucous membrane of the rectum--so
insignificant in some cases as to be recalled with difficulty.In
tropical countries abscess of the liver may be associated with
dysenteric ulcerations.This relation has been frequently observed, but
is far from constant.In Waring's[87] cases, which occurred in India,
31 per cent.of the fatal cases of hepatic abscess arose during the
course of acute or chronic dysentery.De Castro of Alexandria[88] finds
that dysentery is the most frequent cause of abscess in that region,
especially in the Greek hospital.Murchison[89] considers tropical
abscess of the liver as secondary to dysentery in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but by no means in all.In non-tropical
countries abscess of the liver is found to succeed to ulcerations of
the stomach, the intestines, the bile-ducts, etc.In the case of
ulceration of any part of the mucous membrane from which the portal
vein receives branches a morbific material may be conveyed to the
liver.This morbific material may be some unknown septic principle the
presence of which in the liver will excite suppurative inflammation; it
may consist of an embolus having septic power or a merely mechanical
irritant; it may be micrococci or some other living organisms, which,
arrested in the portal radicles, set up inflammatory foci, etc.There
are many examples of hepatic abscess connected with dysenteric
ulcerations of the intestine in which no embolus can be found.Admitting the presence of the embolus originally, its disappearance is
readily understood by reference to the changes induced by suppuration.Excepting these cases there must be many in which no embolus can be
found, because none existed; an unknown septic substance has excited
the suppurative inflammation.Emboli may be lodged in the liver from
thrombi formed in the peripheral distribution of the portal vein, or
from distant parts of the systemic circulation, as in bone diseases.There has been no satisfactory explanation of the manner in which such
emboli pass the pulmonary capillaries to be lodged in the liver.At one
time there was supposed to be a special relation between injuries of
the bones of the head and hepatic abscess, but it is now known {1005}
that these cases are not more numerous than those due to osteo-myelitis
in any situation.Abscesses in the lungs are greatly more frequent than
in the liver in cases of this kind.According to Waldeyer,[90] whilst
in two-thirds of the cases of death from surgical diseases and injuries
there were abscesses in the lungs, in only 6 per cent.were there
abscesses of the liver.It is evident that the emboli entering the
systemic circulation are usually arrested in the pulmonary capillaries.Klebs maintains that such emboli consist of parasitic organisms.[Footnote 87: _On Abscess of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 88: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur Traitement
chirurgical_, par le Dr.S. V. Castro (d'Alexandrie d'Egypte).][Footnote 89: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.[Footnote 90: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xl.Dilatation and ulceration of the bile-ducts were the principal causes
of hepatic abscess, as ascertained by Von Baerensprung, in the Berlin
Pathological Institute.Duodenal catarrh involving the orifice of the
common duct, catarrh of the biliary passages leading to obstruction,
and plugging with a gall-stone have resulted in abscess, the initial
lesion being probably rupture of one or more of the finer tubes or
inflammation leading to suppuration.[91]

[Footnote 91: Grainger Stewart, _The Edinburgh Medical Journal_,
January, 1873.]Finally, a considerable proportion of cases of hepatic abscess arise
under unknown conditions.In such cases, however, it is usually found
that there has been more or less indulgence in alcoholic drinks, or the
liver has been taxed by excesses in the use of rich foods and
condiments, or exposure to extreme degrees of temperature has occurred.In the interior valley of this continent, where hepatic abscess is
comparatively common, the causes are to be found in malarial
influences, in alcoholic indulgence, in dysenteric attacks the product
of climatic variations and improper alimentation, and in the formation
and arrest in transitu of hepatic calculi also the result of
long-continued gastro-duodenal and biliary catarrh.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Great differences of opinion have been expressed
as to the initial lesions in hepatic abscess.It is probable, however,
that these differences are due to the character of the abscess.Some
have their origin in the hepatic cells, others in the connective
tissue, and others still in the vessels.There may be a number of
points at which the suppurative process begins, or it may be limited to
one.Virchow[92] describes the initial lesion as beginning in the
cells, which first become coarsely granular, then opaque, and finally
soften, and pus appears.Klebs, who maintains the constant agency of
septic micrococci, affirms that the changes in the cells are due to
compression exerted by the mass of these organisms distending the
neighboring vessels, and then suppuration begins on the portal side of
the lobules.Liebermeister originally held that the initial lesion is
in the connective tissue; and this view is also supported by Koster,
who brings to bear experimental data.In the walls of the vessels of
the connective tissue and about them, between the hepatic cells, great
numbers of lymphoid cells accumulate.The intercellular spaces are also
distended with plasma and round cells, and in the vicinity of the
central vein the swollen hepatic cells are pressed together; soon
pus-corpuscles appear, and the proper anatomical elements are broken up
into a diffluent mass composed of fat-granules, pus-corpuscles, and
disintegrating hepatic cells.[Footnote 92: _Archiv fur path.When suppurative hepatitis arises from an embolus, or emboli, the
{1006} first step is the change in the appearance of the acini, which
are enlarged and grow softer by disintegration of their cells; then at
the centre a yellowish spot appears, and is made up of the detritus,
granules of fat, and pus.Surrounding such softening portions of the
hepatic tissue is a zone of congestion.When the morbid processes are
excited by emboli, there will be as many centres of pus-formation as
there are particles distributed by the vessels--from two or three to
fifty or more.They may be uniformly distributed through the organ or
be collected in one part.Emboli conveyed by the portal vein will be
arranged with a certain regularity and through the substance of the
liver, whilst those coming from some part of the systemic circulation
tend to form at the periphery under the capsule.Small abscesses in
close proximity unite ultimately by the softening and disintegration of
the intervening tissue.In the so-called tropical abscess, which is the variety so frequently
met with in the interior of this country, the mode of development is
different from the embolic, above described.Owing to the deposit of
some morbific matter whose nature is now unknown, the vessels dilate
and hyperaemia of the part to become the seat of suppuration ensues.The cells become cloudy, granular, and opaque from the deposit of an
albuminous matter in them.Within the area of congestion a yellowish
spot soon appears, surrounded by a translucent, pale-gray ring, and
here suppuration begins; the neighboring cells disintegrate and a
purulent collection is formed, which enlarges by the destruction in
succession of the adjacent portions of hepatic tissue.Whilst this
process is going on there is a border of deep congestion about the
abscess, fading off gradually into the normal tint of the hepatic
parenchyma; the walls of the abscess are rough and irregular from
projections of tissue just beginning to disintegrate, and the pus
burrows in various directions more or less deeply into the softening
parts.The size to which such purulent collections attain is largely
determined by the condition of the liver as a whole.If the organ
attacked is healthy otherwise and the general health is not
deteriorated, the area of the abscess may be limited by a well-defined
membrane and continue inactive for a long time.This limiting membrane
is of inflammatory origin, developed from the connective tissue, and
varies in thickness from a mere line to several.It was formerly called
a pyogenic membrane, because the pus discharged was supposed to be
formed by it.When such a limiting inflammation cannot take place, the
abscess continually enlarges by the softening and destruction of the
adjacent hepatic tissue, and may finally attain to enormous
proportions.The embolic abscesses vary in size from that of a pea to
that of an orange.The so-called tropical abscesses are usually
single--in three-fourths of the cases, according to Rouis;[93] in 62.1
per cent., according to Waring.[94] Of the fatal cases collected by the
latter author, 285 in number, a single abscess existed in 177, and
multiple abscesses in 108.there were two abscesses; in
3.6 per cent., three; and in 5.6 per cent.As regards the part of the liver in which abscess occurs, the
statistics show a great preponderance in favor of the right lobe.In
Waring's collection of 300 cases the right lobe was the {1007} seat of
the abscess in 163, or 67.3 per cent.; the left lobe was affected in
16, or 6.6 per cent.; and both lobes in 35, or 14.4 per cent.The
preponderance of cases affecting the right lobe is the more striking
when it is understood that, other parts being invaded, the right is
included with them in the morbid process.In my own cases the right
lobe was the seat of the abscess in 70 per cent.[Footnote 93: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie_,
_loc.[Footnote 94: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.connected with Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.The contents of the abscesses are affected in character by the form of
the disease, whether embolic or tropical, by its rate of development,
by the condition of the hepatic parenchyma, by the formation of a
limiting membrane, etc.In the more chronic cases, surrounded by a
dense membrane, the pus is usually laudable or dry and cheesy; in the
acute embolic cases the pus is dark brown, ichorous or grumous, and
contains a good deal of detritus of the hepatic parenchyma; and in the
tropical cases it is of a sanguinolent, dark color, or more frequently
of a grayish purulent fluid; and in the acute forms contains much
broken-down tissue, whilst in the chronic cases, in direct ratio to
their duration, the pus approaches the laudable character.The source
of an abscess discharging from the neighborhood of the liver may be
ascertained by a microscopical examination and the discovery of the
hepatic elements (the cells) in the fluid.Bile may also be present in
the pus.The abscesses not confined by a limiting membrane constantly enlarge by
the softening and disintegration of the adjacent liver substance, and
those enclosed or encysted after a period of quiescence of variable
duration begin active efforts to establish communication outwardly.The
point to which a purulent collection in the liver tends becomes an
important element in diagnosis and in treatment.As the abscess
approaches the surface of the liver the capsule inflames, and if
adhesions are not formed more or less sloughing occurs, and the
contents are discharged into the abdominal cavity.Adhesions may form
to the parietes, an external swelling appear, and after a time
discharge take place in the right hypochondrium at some point.Pus may
escape at the umbilicus, in the right inguinal region, posteriorly at
the sacro-iliac junction, and in other situations.Adhesions may form
to the stomach, duodenum, the ascending vena cava, to the diaphragm
opening the thoracic cavity, the pericardium, or the mediastinum; and
the accumulated pus may thus find a vent.According to Waring,[95] the
termination of hepatic abscess is as follows: Of 300 cases, 169, or
56.3 per cent., remained intact--that is, had not advanced beyond the
liver; 48 were evacuated by operation, or 16 per cent.; 14, or 4.6 per
cent., entered the thoracic cavity; 28, or 9.3 per cent., opened into
the right lung; 15, or 5 per cent., entered the abdominal cavity; 7, or
2.3 per cent., opened into the colon; 1 entered the stomach; 3 entered
the hepatic vein near the vena cava; 1 communicated with the hepatic
ducts, 2 with the right kidney, etc.The termination of 162 fatal
cases, according to Rouis,[96] was as follows: 125 proved fatal in
consequence of the extent of the abscess or of the severity of the
accompanying dysentery; 3 terminated by gangrene of the walls of the
abscess; 3 by peritonitis; 12 by opening of the abscess; 2 by rupture
of adhesions; 11 by opening of the abscess into the pleura; 2 by
intercurrent and 3 by secondary pneumonia.Notwithstanding the
differences {1008} in the mode of expressing the conditions, the
general results are the same.[Footnote 95: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.of
Abscess in the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 96: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques, etc._, p.An abscess of the liver having discharged in a favorable way, healing
may take place.There may be such an extent of injury--the whole
secreting structure of the liver being destroyed--that repair is beyond
the power of the organism.The best results are attained when discharge
occurs by the most direct route externally; the next, by way of the
right lung; the third, by the stomach or intestine.Repair cannot be
hoped for when a large part of the normal hepatic structure is
destroyed.When the pus escapes the walls of the abscess approximate,
and union takes place by connective tissue, leaving a radiated or a
merely linear cicatrix to mark the site of the purulent collection.So
perfectly does repair take place in suitable subjects that no trace of
the lesion may remain.Those portions of the liver outside the borders of the abscess, and
beyond the vascular derangements produced by it, may be entirely
healthy.In the cases terminating in recovery the portion of the liver
unaffected by abscess continues to functionate normally.More or less
of the liver may be destroyed; hence it follows that recovery may be
partial.According to the damage done to the proper secreting structure
of the organ will the recovery be partial, limited, or complete.SYMPTOMS.--The existence of an abscess of the liver is determined by
systemic or general and by local symptoms, and they may be acute or
chronic.Systemic.--In acute cases the beginning of mischief may be announced by
a rigor, but more frequently this indicates the onset of suppuration,
and is one of the phenomena of the chronic form.As the disease occurs
in this country, a chill takes place suddenly in a case which presents
the usual symptoms of proctitis (dysentery) during the course of this
affection or soon after its apparent cure; then a febrile movement
occurs, and subsequently an irregular intermittent, the rise of
temperature being preceded by rigors or mere transient chilliness.With
these febrile symptoms there may be associated uneasiness in the right
hypochondrium, acute pain, or a feeling of weight and pressure, with
jaundice, etc.The fever is septicaemic, intermittent, or remittent if
it have any special type.In the septicaemic form the rigors are
severe, occur irregularly, sometimes daily, sometimes twice a day, and
at intervals of two or three days or longer; the fever rises to a high
point--104 degrees, 105 degrees, or higher--and the sweats are profuse.In the intermittent form the fever usually has the quotidian type; some
slight chilliness is experienced in the early morning as a rule, and
the exacerbation occurs in the afternoon and evening, the sweating
being slight toward the morning.More frequently, in the writer's
observation, the type of fever has been remittent, with periodical, but
not regularly so, exacerbations.In such cases the morning temperature
has been at 99 degrees or 100 degrees, and the evening 102 degrees or
103 degrees.Such a range of temperature may be present during three or
four weeks or even longer, the abscess gradually making its way
outwardly.Conclusions may be drawn from the behavior of the febrile
movement as to the character of the local affection, with the
limitations imposed by the necessary uncertainty of the data.If the
chills are decided rigors, the fever {1009} high, and the sweats
profuse, either pyaemic abscesses or large tropical abscesses
implicating neighboring organs exist.The simple intermittent,
especially the remittent, form of fever suggests abscesses of medium
size making their way outwardly, with only partial injury to the parts
traversed.In a certain portion of the cases the type of fever changes
when a large accumulation of pus takes place; after several weeks of a
mild remittent the fever becomes irregularly intermittent with rigors,
strong exacerbations, and profuse sweats.In protracted cases the fever
assumes the typhoid aspect; there is profound adynamia, dry tongue,
sordes, diarrhoea, and the usual symptoms of this state.When the
secreting structure of the liver is destroyed to a large extent, the
condition of acholia is superadded to the typhoid state.The pulse is irritable and quick from the beginning of the symptoms.In
a few instances a slow pulse, such as occurs in jaundice, has been
observed, but generally the number of cardiac contractions is in a
direct ratio with the body temperature.When typhoid symptoms supervene
in advanced cases the pulse becomes weak and dicrotic.The chronic cases with
mild remittent fever have little more than slight moisture of the
surface, whilst the acute and pyaemic cases are characterized by
profuse sweats.If to an irregular febrile movement, preceded by chills
and followed by sweats, there is added the tendency to sweat on all
occasions--on slight exertion, on sleeping, under any
excitement--suppuration may be suspected.General malaise, a sense of fatigue and exhaustion, and progressive
decline in flesh and strength occur.It is remarkable, however, how
some obese subjects preserve their roundness and apparent fulness of
habit.Usually, however, emaciation advances pari passu with the
progress of the suppuration.The more acute the symptoms, the more
rapid the wasting.When an encysted abscess develops in the course of a
chronic dysentery, there may be no appreciable change in the condition
of the patient properly attributable to the additional lesion.The loss
of appetite, the frequent vomiting, and often the dysenteric troubles,
contribute materially to the exhaustion and the wasting of the tissues.The stomachal derangements may be present with the initial symptoms,
but they are usually more pronounced when the abscess attains to
considerable size.A peculiar tint of the skin, especially of the face, is observed in
those cases without jaundice.There is an earthy or sallow hue, which
to the practised eye signifies suppuration.Jaundice is present in a
less proportion of cases.In 13 of Waring's cases the skin is said to
be sallow.In Rouis's collection icterus was present in 17 per cent.,
or 26 times in 155 patients.According to Waring, jaundice is rarely
present.In the 12 cases in my own hands actual jaundice was not
present in one, but 9 had an earthy hue or presented some yellowness of
the conjunctiva.In fact, jaundice does not have the importance as a
symptom which might, a priori, have been expected.The mental condition of these subjects is that of depression.They
sleep poorly, are disturbed by vivid dreams of a horrifying character,
and the nocturnal sweats increase the tendency to wakefulness.Hypochondria, or at least marked symptoms of mental depression, as
{1010} Hammond[97] has shown, are present in many cases.So frequent,
indeed, seems to be the association of a depressed mental state with
hepatic abscess that in every case of the former the liver should be
carefully explored.Hammond goes so far as to say that in every case of
hypochondriasis puncture of the liver with the aspirator needle should
be practised when any symptom, however indefinite, indicates the
existence of an abscess.Besides the condition of hypochondriasis in
many cases, there may be stupor, hebetude of mind, confusion due to
acholia, cholaemia (Flint's cholesteraemia), when a large part of the
liver structure is destroyed.[Footnote 97: _Neurological Contributions_, vol.68: "On
Obscure Abscesses of the Liver, their association with Hypochondria and
other Forms of Mental Derangement, and their Treatment."]Sweating has already been referred to as a phenomenon connected with
the febrile movement.It is necessary to state further that this may
vary in amount from a mere moisture of the surface connected with
sleep, or it may be a profuse diaphoresis with which the febrile
paroxysm terminates.As a systemic symptom, sweating is strongly
suggestive of suppuration, and may therefore be extremely significant,
in this connection, of suppuration in the liver.According to Waring,
of 75 cases specifically interrogated on this point, 72 presented this
symptom.123) to it as very constantly present, coming
on chiefly at night--sometimes generally over the body, sometimes
limited to the head, and always accompanied by an accelerated pulse.The urine in cases of hepatic abscess varies; it is never normal.There
may be merely an excess of urates--a symptom common enough in all
febrile affections and in suppuration.It is usually high-,
deficient in urea, and contains leucin and tyrosin, and not often
bile-pigment, except when jaundice is present, which, as we have seen,
is rather uncommon.It should be borne in mind that whilst the above-described mental and
cerebral and other symptoms are often present, they are by no means
invariably so.There are cases, usually of encysted abscess, in which
no functional disturbance of any kind exists.But the systemic symptoms
are by no means so important as the local.To these we must now direct
attention.Local.--The position, size, and shape of the liver are not without
significance, but it is strictly correct to say that an abscess of the
liver may exist without any change in the size of the organ or in its
relations to the surrounding organs.In 2 of 12 cases in the hands of
the writer there was no evidence of enlargement of the right
hypochondrium, but a difference in circumference of half an inch was
ascertained in favor of the left side.In 4 cases there was no
appreciable change in the size of the hepatic region; in one-half there
was an increase in the area of hepatic dulness.In one of the cases in
which the left side was the larger the abscess was of enormous extent,
and discharged by the stomach and intestine.The enlargement of the
liver may be very great.In one instance observed by the author the
abscess reached to the upper border of the third rib.Rarely does the
dulness extend more than two fingers' breadth below the inferior margin
of the ribs, although cases are reported in which the enlarged organ
reached to the crest of the ileum.As a rule, the diaphragm is pushed
up and the lung displaced, rather than the dulness is extended
downward.When the first tumefaction {1011} due to the initial
congestion takes place, the organ may be much larger than subsequently,
the pus becoming encysted and the normal state outside of the area of
suppuration being restored.The purulent collection in a large
proportion of the cases taking place in the right lobe, the extension
of dulness is in the same lines as the normal.When, however, the right
lobe is the seat of abscess, or a purulent collection forms around an
impacted calculus, the swelling may appear in the outer border of the
epigastrium next the ribs, and the increased area of dulness will be
across the epigastrium and occupying the superior portion of this
region.The general experience on these points corresponds to my own.Thus, according to Waring, there was an evident enlargement of the
liver in 90 cases, and no enlargement in 11.In most cases the increase
in size gives the impression of a fulness or hardness of the liver or
of a diffused swelling or tumor of the epigastrium.In some instances
the right hypochondrium is bulged out, the intercostal spaces widened,
and the side appears to be or is actually elevated, and occasionally
enlarged veins form, as in cases of the obstructed portal circulation
of cirrhosis.In a case recently presented at Jefferson College
Hospital clinic by the author, a globular swelling formed in the walls
of the abdomen just below the inferior margin of the ribs near the site
of the gall-bladder, and was held by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of this locality; but it had the history of an hepatic abscess, and
ultimately proved to be one.Rouis furnishes statistical evidence of
the time when the increase in size of the liver occurs with respect to
the other symptoms.He has noted an enlargement of the organ 73 times
in 122 cases.Of 51 cases, the liver was enlarged in 12 before
suppuration, in 22 at the onset of suppuration, and in 17 after
suppuration was established.In 49 examples the liver was enlarged in 2
before any other symptom was manifest, in 8 at the onset of symptoms,
and in 39 after the symptoms were well declared.Fluctuation is not referred to by the writers in general, and there are
no statistical data on this symptom, so far as our observation extends.No symptom could be more uncertain in all doubtful cases.When a large
accumulation has taken place and the parietes of the sac are thin,
fluctuation may be detected, but it cannot then be regarded as
decisive.When an abscess in the interior of the right lobe is
encysted, no fluctuation can be effected.The best mode of eliciting
fluctuation, according to Hammond, is to place the extremities of the
fingers of the left hand in the depression between the ribs over the
most prominent part of the right hypochondrium, and gently tap with the
fingers of the right hand the right border of the epigastrium.In 3 out
of 12 cases this method has apparently elicited fluctuation in my own
experience.The elasticity of the hepatic structure is such that the
method of palpation, however practised, must return a sensation nearly
allied to that of fluctuation in a purulent accumulation.It is
certain, therefore, that errors of observation are liable to occur, and
hence conclusions based on an apparent fluctuation should be accepted
with caution; under any circumstances it should be very distinct, and
even then should not be acted on unless supported by other suggestive
evidence.The uneasiness or pain felt in the right hypochondrium varies greatly
according to the position of the abscess, the degree and kind of
pressure exerted on neighboring organs, and the period of its
development.When {1012} the peritoneal layer of the liver is involved,
there will usually be acute pain, and this happens at two periods--when
the abscess first forms from an impacted calculus or from any cause
which includes the peritoneum, and subsequently when the pus, making
its way from the liver, excites inflammation in the peritoneal
investment of the liver, of the diaphragm, or affects ultimately the
pleural membrane.In the so-called pyaemic abscesses there is very
little pain, and in the case of the large single abscess in the
interior of the right lobe there is rather a sensation of weight or of
heaviness, of dragging than of acute pain.When the capsule of the
liver is put on the stretch or the peritoneal investment is inflamed,
then acute pain may be felt.More or less pain or local distress is, on
the whole, a usual symptom.According to Rouis,[98] local pain is
present in 141 out of 177 cases, or in 85 per cent.The statistics of
Waring[99] closely correspond, for of 173 patients affected with this
malady, in 153 there was more or less pain referable to the affected
organ.The position of the pain has some influence in determining the
seat of the malady, and often indicates the position of the abscess.As
respects the character of the pain, there is little uniformity; in
general it is a tensive, heavy, throbbing sensation, but under the
circumstances above mentioned this may have an acute or lancinating
character, as when the capsule or the peritoneal investment of the
organ becomes involved.[Footnote 98: _Recherches, etc._, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 99: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

Besides the pain directly referable to the liver there are painful
sensations felt in the neighboring parts, of very considerable
significance.These are often described as sympathetic pains, and are
referred to the shoulder--to the right shoulder when the right lobe is
the seat of mischief, and to the left shoulder when the abscess forms
in the left lobe of the liver.Although this statement has many
limitations, it is not without diagnostic importance.Rouis ascertained
the existence of the shoulder pain in 17 per cent.of the cases, or in
28 in a total of 163.Waring reports that this symptom was observed in
52 in a total of 76 cases.The right shoulder seems to be affected in
about the same ratio as the right lobe of the liver in 25 times out of
26 cases, according to Rouis.The shoulder pain appears at the same
time, in a majority of cases, as the hepatic pain, but it is very
capricious.It is most frequently at the top of the shoulder, but it
may be at the end of the clavicle, in the scapula, or extend down the
arm.Its duration is very irregular, appearing occasionally during the
existence of the disease, coming on at the outset, and lasting weeks or
months, or only felt on pressure over the liver, on coughing, or on
taking a full inspiration.The character of the pain is equally
uncertain.It is usually heavy, tensive, stinging, or may be merely a
sensation of soreness or of uneasiness or of weariness.The behavior of
the shoulder pain is partly explicable by reference to the path by
which the reflex is conveyed.As Luschka[100] has shown, the filaments
of the phrenic nerve supplied to the suspensory ligament and capsule of
the liver, put on the stretch or irritated, convey the impression to
the cord, and it is reflected over the sensory fibres of the fourth
cervical distributed to the shoulder.Rouis reports an instance in
which the deltoid was wasted.[Footnote 100: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

The decubitus of patients affected with hepatic abscess is often {1013}
extremely characteristic.To obviate the pressure on the swollen and
inflamed organ the position assumed is right lateral-dorsal, the body
inclined to the right, the right thigh flexed on the pelvis, and the
spinal column so curved as to relax the abdominal muscles of the right
side.When the pain and tenderness are not great there may be frequent
changes of position, but in repose the lateral-dorsal decubitus is
assumed.When the suppuration is well advanced and the accumulation
large, the patient keeps in that position nearly constantly.If
pressure interferes with the normal play of the lungs, and dyspnoea is
produced on assuming the recumbent posture, the attitude taken
expresses this state also: then the decubitus is lateral and partly
dorsal, but the body is raised to a half-upright.There are many
exceptions to these rules.Some lie easiest on the back, some on the
left side; but it is quite certain that much the largest number, when
uninfluenced by special circumstances, naturally place themselves as
above described.Jaundice is amongst the rarer symptoms.Rouis finds it to be present in
17 per cent.of the cases, Thierfelder in 16 per cent., and Waring in
somewhat less than 6 per cent.Referring to my own observation,
jaundice has rarely been present, but some yellowness of the
conjunctivae and a faint yellow tint of the skin generally have been
evident.The peculiar aspect of the countenance connected with
suppuration has rarely been wanting.When jaundice does occur, it is
referable to two conditions--to a catarrhal swelling of the bile-ducts,
which may be coincident with the onset of the suppurative inflammation;
to the pressure of the abscess on the hepatic or common duct, which
must happen at a late period.As an abscess of the liver forms and enlarges, pressure is exerted on
neighboring organs, producing very decided disturbances.Nausea and
vomiting, anorexia, a coated or glazed tongue, diarrhoea or dysentery,
are amongst the disorders of this kind involving the digestive
apparatus.There is nothing characteristic in the condition of the tongue which
does not belong to suppuration in any situation.Nevertheless, there
are some appearances that have a certain value in conjunction with
other diagnostic signs.At the onset of the suppurative inflammation
the tongue is more or less heavily coated, but as the case proceeds it
becomes dry and glazed in parts, whilst covered with a well-defined
membrane-like crust at the base and margins.This appearance is very
characteristic of the cases of suppuration, the abscess enlarging.In a
very important case observed by me lately there was a well-marked
diphtheritic-like exudation of the tongue and fauces toward the
termination of the case, the membrane forming as the pus accumulated.This appearance was coincident with a typhoid state.Nausea and vomiting appear with the beginning of symptoms, are
associated with the general signs of systemic disturbance, and are
especially prominent when an accumulation of pus takes place, being due
under these circumstances to pressure on the hepatic and solar plexuses
or to direct encroachment on the stomach--probably to both causes.The
frequency and persistence of the vomiting are points of much diagnostic
importance, according to Maclean[101] and Fayrer,[102] which I {1014}
am able to fully confirm from my own experience.The matters ejected by
vomiting consist of the contents of the stomach--glairy mucus, the
accumulation in the gall-bladder, altered blood (coffee-grounds)--and
the contents of the abscess if it discharge by the stomach.The
vomiting is most apt to occur during the febrile exacerbation or at the
time of sweating.The statistics are conclusive as to the frequency of
vomiting as a symptom.Of 84 cases in which special reference was made
to this point, in 74 nausea or vomiting existed.In my own experience
this symptom has never been wanting.[Footnote 101: "The Diagnostic Value of Uncontrollable Vomiting," by W.
C. Maclean, _Brit.Journ._, August 1, 1873.][Footnote 102: _Ibid._, September 26, 1873.]The relation between abscess of the liver and dysentery has been much
discussed.Under the head of Causes the influence of dysentery as a
pathogenetic factor has already been examined.We have now to study its
symptomatic relations.A considerable proportion of the cases occurring
in this country have been preceded by proctitis--simple, sporadic
dysentery affecting the rectum.In India a close relationship has been
traced between ulcerations of the intestinal canal and abscess.of the cases have occurred in those
who were actually suffering from dysentery or recent or old
ulcerations.As observed by Rouis in Algiers, out of 143 cases there
were 128 with dysentery, or 90 per cent.Budd[103] long ago maintained
that a peculiar poison generated at an open ulceration in the intestine
was the true cause.Moxon,[104] Dickinson, and others have lately
reaffirmed this explanation.A case by the latter[105] casts a strong
light on this question: A patient had extensive dysenteric ulceration
of the intestine and an abscess of the liver, without any symptoms
indicating their existence.Such a case teaches the instructive lesson
that dysenteric ulcerations may escape detection, and hence the
connection between abscess and the intestinal lesion remains unknown.In a small proportion of cases--about 5 per cent.--dysentery is a
result, apparently, of hepatic abscess.Whether the relation is
admitted to exist or not, it is a curious fact that in so many cases
ulcerative disease of the intestinal canal accompanies the hepatic
affection.Hemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum, gastro-intestinal
catarrh, etc.are produced by the pressure of an enlarging abscess on
the portal vein.[Footnote 103: _Diseases of the Liver_, 3d ed., p.[Footnote 104: _Pathological Transactions_, 1862 and subsequently.Numerous cases are recorded in the various volumes up to 1880.][Footnote 105: _Ibid._, vol.The urine contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, is usually
loaded with urates, and the amount of urea may be deficient when much
of the hepatic tissue is destroyed.From the beginning of symptoms some cough is experienced: it is short
and dry, but after a time in many cases the cough is catching and
painful, and finally may be accompanied by profuse purulent
expectoration.The breathing is short and catching when by the upward
extension of the mischief the diaphragm is encroached on, and may
become very painful when the pleura is inflamed.Ulceration of an
abscess into the lungs is announced by the signs of a local
pleuro-pneumonia--by the catching inspiration, the friction sound, the
crepitant rale, the bronchophony and bronchial breathing, and bloody
sputa usually, etc.Some time before the abscess really reaches the
diaphragm, preparation is made in the lung for the discharge through a
bronchus.The author has seen {1015} many examples of this, and a very
striking illustration of the same fact is afforded in a case by
Dickinson,[106] in which an abscess holding about four ounces was
contained in the upper part of the right lobe; its walls were irregular
and not lined by a limiting membrane.It is further stated that the
"right pleura was coated with flocculent lymph, and the cavity
contained serous fluid," etc.Here, in advance of the abscess,
preparation was made for its discharge through the lung.The tendency
of an abscess of the abdomen to external discharge is manifested in two
directions: those of the upper part tend to discharge through the
lungs, those of the lower part through the natural openings below.Abscesses of the liver come within the former rule, but it is not of
invariable application, since some discharge by the stomach or
intestine, some externally; yet a large proportion make their way
through the lungs.Another symptom referable to the pulmonary organs in
cases of hepatic abscess is singultus, or hiccough.This is a symptom
of the period of discharge rather, and is often extremely protracted
and exhausting.Pericarditis occurs in those cases in which discharge
takes place in this direction, and it may develop, as does pleuritis,
in advance of any change in the diaphragm.This preparation of the
thoracic organs for external discharge seems almost like a conscious
purpose, as if an intelligent supervision of these processes were
exercised.[Footnote 106: _Transactions of the Pathological Society_, vol.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As the facts already given have
sufficiently shown, the course of abscess of the liver is extremely
uncertain.From the beginning to the end there may not be a single
indication of its presence.On the other hand, a well-marked case is
perfectly characteristic.Abscesses of the liver are acute and
chronic--the former of short duration, accompanying pyaemia, portal
phlebitis, and similar conditions; the latter, arising in the course of
chronic dysentery or from unknown causes, especially if encysted,
remaining latent for weeks or months.The course of an abscess is much
influenced by the direction taken by the pus in the attempt at
discharge.This portion of the subject requires careful statement and
thorough treatment, and we therefore present it somewhat in detail.Beginning with his individual observations, the abscess in the author's
12 cases discharged--3 externally, 5 by the lungs, and 4 by the stomach
or intestines.In Waring's[107] collection of 300 fatal cases, 169
remained intact at death, 48 were operated on; consequently, only 83
are left for the purpose of this comparison.Of 83 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging spontaneously in some direction, 42 escaped into
the thoracic cavity or by the right lung (in 28); into the abdominal
cavity (15) or stomach (1) or intestine (7), 23; externally 2, besides
in special directions to be hereafter referred to.Rouis[108] has
tabulated the results in 30 cases of abscess fatal without an operative
influence.Of these, 2 discharged externally, 17 by the thorax (15 by
the lung), 5 by the stomach, 4 by the intestine, and 2 by the biliary
canals.[Footnote 107: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.[Footnote 108: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie,
etc._, _loc.The appearances presented when the discharge takes place through the
external parts are by no means uniform.When the epigastric or
umbilical region is the point of discharge, a globular tumor forms,
which may {1016} be mistaken for a fibroid or fatty growth; softening
in the centre of the mass occurs, and ultimately the pus is discharged.If the pus makes its way outwardly through the right hypochondrium, the
tumor formed is furrowed by the attachment to the ribs, and several
openings usually occur.The pus may burrow under the skin for some
distance and point in the axilla, or, making its way along the
suspensory ligament, emerge at the navel, or, descending, appear in the
lumbar region or under Poupart's ligament.As the statistics prove, the most usual route for discharge to take
place is by the thoracic cavity, especially the right lung.Some time
in advance of an opening in the diaphragm a localized pleuro-pneumonia
occurs, adhesions form between the pulmonary and costal pleura, and a
channel is tunnelled out for the passage of the pus to a bronchus.The
discharge of pus suddenly occurs after some days of cough and bloody
expectoration.Even in favorable cases the amount is so large that the
patient has extreme difficulty in disposing of it, and in unfavorable
cases, the quantity being large, the patient's life is ended by apnoea.In still other cases an extensive purulent accumulation may form in the
pleural cavity, the lung is compressed, and all the phenomena of an
empyema superadded to those of a hepatic abscess.In a case reported by
Westphalen[109] all the bile secreted by the patient came out by an
opening in the fifth intercostal space.The empyema thus induced may
indeed be the principal lesion, as in the case of the late Gen.Breckenridge, on whom thoracentesis was performed by Sayre of New York,
and in a case reported by Lower.[110] So far from this being uncommon,
as asserted by Thierfelder, when an abscess of the liver approaches the
diaphragm inflammatory symptoms begin on the pleural side, and thus
pyothorax may occur in advance of the perforation of this septum.[Footnote 109: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.Med._, 1873, Band xi.[Footnote 110: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1864, p.The opening of an hepatic abscess into the pericardium is rare, since
in Waring's collection of 300 fatal cases there was not one.When it
does occur, pain is experienced about the heart; the action of the
organ becomes irregular; praecordial anxiety and oppression are felt;
suffocative attacks occur; and very soon the symptoms of pericarditis
arise.Perforation of the ascending vena cava or of the hepatic vein
happens in about 2 per cent.When a quantity of pus is
thus turned into the circulation, disastrous results follow, not so
much from the infective nature of the pus as from the sudden increased
pressure within the vascular system and the labor imposed on the heart,
already failing.The escape of the pus into the peritoneal cavity occurs in about 11 per
cent.of the cases of spontaneous evacuation, according to Waring.Of
the 162 fatal cases collected by Rouis, 14 opened into the
peritoneum--about the same proportion as Waring gives.When discharge
takes place into the peritoneum, the patient passes into a condition of
collapse, or peritonitis is excited and rapidly proves fatal.In rare
instances the inflammatory reaction is restricted to a small area,
ulceration takes place through the abdominal parietes, and thus
discharge is effected.An opening may be made into the intestine or into the pelvis of the
kidney.In the former case pus is discharged by stool or by vomit, and
often in enormous quantity; in the latter by the urine, frequent and
{1017} painful micturition, with much pus, being the evidence of the
accident.In either case communication may be kept up with the abscess,
and the patient be worn out with the exhausting discharge maintained by
the intercommunication between the abscess and the canal through which
discharge takes place.Cases of hepatic abscess prove fatal without perforation.In Waring's
collection of 300 cases, 169 remained intact, in the words of the
author--that is, did not extend beyond the boundaries of the liver.Of
203 cases collected by Rouis, 96 did not extend beyond the liver.According to Thierfelder, about one-half of the cases of hepatic
abscess perforate the liver.These statistics therefore closely
correspond, and the general conclusion is very nearly expressed in the
formulated statement of Thierfelder.The duration of hepatic abscess cannot readily be expressed in figures.The acute cases terminate early by reason of the various complicating
conditions.The chronic cases are much influenced in their duration by
the presence of a limiting membrane, for if this be formed the duration
will be protracted over weeks or months; and those cases not thus
confined are necessarily of shorter duration.A period of latency may
result when the extension of the morbid process is thus hindered.Forming a conclusion from the general conduct of the cases, it may be
said that the duration of hepatic abscess is from two weeks to six
months.Of 220 cases collected by Waring, the average duration was 39
days.Rouis fixes the average duration in 179 cases at 60 days.Of
Waring's cases, the largest number (59) terminated in from 10 to 20
days; whilst Rouis places the maximum number (104) at from 11 to 60
days, the shortest duration of any case being 10 days, and the longest
480 days.The termination may be accelerated by the manner of discharge, as when
the abscess opens into the ascending vena cava, into the sac of the
pericardium, or into the peritoneal cavity.In my own cases, carefully
selected for these observations, death occurred in one during discharge
by the right lung, one within twelve hours after discharge by the
intestine, and one within ten days after discharge by the stomach and
intestine, the mortality of the whole being 75 per cent.In Waring's
collection of 300 fatal cases, 169 died whilst the abscess was still
intact--that is, in the liver.The mortality from abscess of the liver is very large.In Rouis's
collection of 203 cases, 162 died, 39 recovered entirely, and 2
improved; 80 per cent., therefore, proved fatal.According to De
Castro,[111] whose observations were made at Alexandria, Egypt, 93 in
208 cases died, this being 72.5 per cent.According to Ramirez,[112] of
11 cases of which an account is given in his memoir, 10 died and 1
recovered--a mortality of 90 per cent.40) also gives the
results arrived at by the Medico-chirurgical Society of Alexandria, who
collected 72 cases of abscess, of which 58 died, making the percentage
of deaths 80.5.Various circumstances besides the abscess affect the
result.An early successful operation, the mode of discharge, the
amount of hepatic tissue destroyed by the {1018} suppuration, the
extent of pre-existing lesions--especially ulcerations of the
intestinal canal--are important factors in the result.In respect to
some of these we have valuable statistical data.The discharge through
the lungs is the most favorable route, next by the parietes of the
abdomen, and lastly by the intestinal canal.One-half of those cases in
which discharge is effected by the right lung get well.This is my own
experience, and it accords with the observations of Rouis, of De
Castro, and others.Rouis gives the result in 30 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging by the right lung; of these 15 recovered.Of 25
cases observed by De Castro, discharging by the lungs, 19 recovered.Next to the discharge by the bronchi, the most favorable mode of exit
is externally, through the parietes of the abdomen; much less favorable
is by the stomach or intestine; but still more fatal is the discharge
into the cavity of the peritoneum.When the abscesses are multiple and
due to pyaemia, the termination is always in death.The numerous
lesions besides the hepatic accelerate the fatal issue.In the case of
large single abscesses the result is in a great measure due to
exhaustion from protracted suppuration.When in addition to the
formation of a great quantity of pus there is frequent vomiting and
rejection of aliment, the failure of strength is proportionally rapid.In favorable cases, after an abscess is evacuated through the right
lung, recovery takes place promptly.When the discharge occurs through
the abdominal wall, the process is much slower, and often fistulous
passages with several orifices, very slow to heal, are formed.Complete
recovery may ultimately take place.The recovery will be incomplete in
those cases with large loss of hepatic substance, especially when this
coincides, as it usually does, with catarrh, ulceration, and other
lesions of the intestinal tube.Again, the recovery will be incomplete
in those cases where there are imperfect healing of the abscess site
and a fistulous communication with the exterior.[Footnote 111: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, _loc.[Footnote 112: _Du Traitement des Abces du Foie, Observations
receuilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, _loc.cit._]

It is possible for the arrest and healing of a suppurative inflammation
of the liver to take place without discharge.Under such circumstances
the watery part of the pus is absorbed, the solid constituents undergo
a fatty metamorphosis, are emulsionized, and thus absorbed, and
gradually closure of the damaged area is effected by a
connective-tissue formation.We must, however, accept with caution
those examples of this process which are supposed to have occurred
because radiating cicatrices are discovered on the surface of the
liver.In a case of hepatic abscess discharging through the lung, known
to the writer, after death, which occurred fifteen years subsequently,
there was no trace of the mischief, so perfectly had repair been
effected.Radiating cicatrices are so often of syphilitic origin that
they cannot be accepted as proof of the former existence of an abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--He who finds the diagnosis of abscess of the liver easy
under all circumstances can have had but little experience with the
numerous difficulties in the way of a correct opinion.There are cases
so plain that the most casual inspection suffices to form a conclusion;
there are cases so difficult that the most elaborate study fails to
unravel the mystery.The maladies with which hepatic abscess may be
confounded are echinococcus of the liver, dropsy of the gall-bladder,
cancer, abscess of the abdominal wall, empyema, or hydrothorax, etc.As
regards echinococcus, the difference consists in the slow and painless
enlargement characteristic of echinococcus, and the absence of any
symptoms other than those {1019} due to the mere pressure of the
enlarging mass.In abscess there may be no apparent enlargement, or the
increase in the area of dulness may be very great, or after a period of
increase of size there may be contraction due to the formation of pus,
and hence limitation of the inflammation; finally, the accumulation of
fluid may be sufficient to cause dulness up to the inferior margin of
the second rib.There are no corresponding changes of size in the
echinococcus cyst.Furthermore, abscess of the liver large enough to be
recognized by the increased dimensions of the organ will be accompanied
by more or less pain in the right hypochondrium and by a septicaemic
fever.On the other hand, an echinococcus tumor is not accompanied by
fever, pain, or tenderness, and it has that peculiar elastic trembling
known as the purring tremor.The most certain means of differential
diagnosis is the use of an aspiration-needle and the withdrawal of a
portion of the fluid.The presence of pus with hepatic cells will be
conclusive of abscess, whilst a serous fluid with echinococci hooklets
will prove the existence of the echinococcus cyst.In cases of dropsy of the gall-bladder there are no febrile symptoms,
no chills, and the tenderness when present is limited to the pyriform
body, the seat of the accumulation of fluid, and no general enlargement
of the liver can be made out.At the point of swelling fluctuation may
be detected, or if the gall-bladder is filled with calculi the
sensation imparted to the touch is that of a hard, nodular body of an
area and position corresponding to that of the gall-bladder.Tapping
the gall-bladder, an easy and safe procedure, will resolve all doubts.When an impaction of a gall-stone is the cause of abscess, the clinical
history is eminently characteristic: there are attacks of hepatic
colic, after one of which the chills, fever, and sweats belonging to
hepatic abscess occur.The differentiation of cancer of the liver from abscess rests on the
following considerations: In cancer there is slow enlargement, with
pain; a more or less nodular state of the organ without fluctuation;
usually ascites; no rigors; no fever and sweats.In abscess the liver
may or may not be enlarged; there are rigors, fever, and sweating, and
the surface of the organ, so far as it can be reached, is smooth and
elastic, and it may be fluctuating.Cancer happens in persons after
middle life, develops very slowly, and is accompanied by a peculiar
cachexia; abscess occurs at any period, very often succeeds to or is
accompanied by dysentery and by the usual phenomena of suppuration.It is extremely difficult to separate an abscess in the abdominal wall,
in the right hypochondrium, or a tumor in this region, from an abscess
of the liver.The history of the case, the existence of a dysentery or
of an apparent intermittent or remittent fever before the appearance of
a purulent collection, will indicate the liver as the probable source
of the trouble.Attention has already been called to a case in which an
abscess of the liver was supposed by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of the abdominal wall.The history in this case of an obstinate
remittent fever, followed by the appearance of a tumor of the
hypochondrium and by a preliminary discharge at the umbilicus, clearly
indicated the nature of the trouble.In the absence of any history of
the case it is extremely difficult to fix the origin of a suppurating
tumor originating, apparently, in the depth of the right hypochondrium.Mistakes are frequently made in the case of an abscess developing in
{1020} the convexity of the right lobe of the liver and pushing the
diaphragm up to the third, even to the second, rib, and thus producing
conditions identical with empyema of the right thorax.Such instances
of hepatic abscess are peculiarly difficult of recognition, because,
the physical signs being the same as those of empyema, the
differentiation must rest on the clinical history.In cases of empyema
proper the effusion in the chest is preceded by pain and accompanied by
an increasing difficulty of breathing; in hepatic abscess there are, as
a rule, symptoms of disturbance in the hepatic functions, fluctuation
in the hepatic region, dysentery, etc., long anterior to any
disturbance in the thoracic organs.Again, empyema may be a latent
affection, without any symptom except some obscure pain and a
progressive increase in the difficulty of breathing; on the other hand,
abscess of the liver is preceded by symptoms of liver disease and of
associated maladies.A dry, purposeless cough is present in many cases
of abscess; a painful cough with bloody expectoration occurs when
preparation is making for discharge through the lungs.Errors of diagnosis are liable to occur in the consideration of
symptoms unquestionably hepatic in origin.Thus, the intermittent fever
accompanying some cases of hepatic colic, like the shivering fits and
fever which occur in cases of nephro-lithiasis, may be confounded with
the septicaemic fever of hepatic abscess.An attentive examination of
the attendant circumstances, especially a careful survey of the right
hypochondrium, can alone determine the nature of the symptoms.In all
doubtful cases the experimentum crucis of puncture with the
exploring-needle becomes a measure of necessity.When all diagnostic
indications are at fault, the needle of the aspirator may decide the
issue.An abundant experience has shown that a needle of suitable size
may be introduced into the right lobe without any ill result--often,
indeed, with distinctly good effects when there is no suppuration or
when pus cannot be detected.In the present state of our knowledge it
cannot be determined why puncture of the organ should be beneficial in
cases having the symptomatic type of hepatic abscess when none exists;
but of this fact there is no doubt.TREATMENT.--As the formation of pus is coincident with or causative of
the first symptoms, it is obvious that treatment directed to prevent an
abscess can rarely succeed.Yet it is probable that now and then an
abscess just forming has been arrested and healing effected.At the
onset of symptoms some large doses of quinine, with a little morphine
(scruple j of the former and 1/8 gr.of the latter), every four or six
hours, may have a decided curative effect.During the course of the
septicaemic fever, with its chills and febrile exacerbations, quinine
in full doses and alcohol according to the conditions present are
necessary remedies.As the symptoms develop saline laxatives are useful
until the formation of pus becomes evident, when all perturbating
treatment of the intestinal canal should cease.If dysentery be present
when the hepatic symptoms arise, it should be cured as promptly as
possible; and of all remedies for this purpose, ipecac given in the
usual antidysenteric quantity offers the best prospect of relief.For
the dysentery which succeeds to abscess, and is probably, in part at
least, dependent on portal obstruction, the mineral astringents, as
copper sulphate, are the most effective remedies.As far as
practicable, after an abscess has formed the intestinal canal should be
kept quiet, for any considerable disturbance will {1021} endanger the
escape of pus into the peritoneal cavity.Persistent vomiting is very
significant of pressure by an enlarging abscess in the stomach, and
usually signifies an abscess associated with impacted calculus.It is
important in such cases to maintain, as far as can be done, a quiescent
condition of the stomach, for the purpose of preventing rupture into
the peritoneal cavity and to favor the nutrition which is seriously
endangered by the repeated vomiting.Effervescent soda powders are very
useful; carbolic acid in solution, or creasote-water with or without
bismuth, is beneficial; champagne, very dry and highly effervescent,
has been, in the writer's hands, remarkably efficient.As food becomes
a most important need in such cases, milk and lime-water, wine-whey,
egg-nog, and similar aliments must be given in small doses and
frequently.Nutrient enemata, prepared from eggs, milk, and beef-juice,
with the materials for digestion--acid and pepsin--may be made to
supplement the stomach, but such efforts have a very limited utility,
owing to the state of the hepatic functions and to the obstruction of
the portal circuit.In all cases it is necessary to maintain the
strength by suitable aliment and the judicious use of stimulants.The
long-continued and profuse suppuration makes an enormous demand on the
vital resources of the patient, and this must be compensated by
suitable food-supplies.As the formation of pus has taken place in most cases when symptoms
have begun, the question of highest importance is, Shall the pus be
evacuated?The statistical evidence relating to this question becomes
then an extremely valuable guide.As in almost all cases of puncture of
the liver for the evacuation of an abscess some part of the liver
substance must be passed through, it is necessary to note how far this
can be done without inflicting permanent injury on the organ.Hammond
has punctured the liver in eight cases without the presence of an
abscess, and of these not one has presented any unfavorable symptom.The author has punctured the liver, penetrating well into the interior,
in two cases in which no abscess was discovered, but the symptoms of
hepatitis existed, with the effect to improve the symptoms.In
Condon's[113] collection of 11 cases there were 8 of abscess evacuated
by the trocar, and 3 of acute hepatitis in which abscess had not
formed, but in which the puncture procured the most decided
amelioration of the symptoms.We have heretofore referred to Hammond's
experience in the puncture of the liver in cases of hypochondriasis,
this condition appearing to depend in some instances on the presence of
abscess.In a number of instances abscesses did exist, but in many
others there was no apparent lesion of the liver, but in these cases
the puncture of the organ was without any ill result.Testimony to the
same effect is given by Ramirez,[114] who asserts that he had not known
a single instance in which any ill result followed puncture of the
liver.It may therefore be regarded as certain that exploratory
puncture of the organ for the purpose of diagnosis as well as for
treatment can at any time be performed with suitable precautions in
respect to the size, condition, and character of the instrument.[Footnote 113: "On the Use of the Aspirator in Hepatic Abscess," Dr.E.
H. Condon, _The Lancet_ (London), August, 1877.][Footnote 114: _Du Traitement des Abces du Foie, Observations
recueilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, p.The authorities of most experience are agreed that, provided with the
{1022} aspirator, the abscess may be punctured as soon as a purulent
collection can be ascertained to exist.The obvious reason for tapping
the abscess is its tendency to extend in various directions, destroying
the hepatic substance.In those examples confined by a limiting
membrane, after a time of inactivity ulceration begins, and the pus
seeks an outlet in some direction.The early evacuation by a suitable
aspirator becomes then a measure of the highest necessity.The good
effects of puncture with even such a crude instrument as the trocar is
well exhibited in the statistics collected by Waring.[115] In a
collection of 81 cases opened by the knife or trocar there were 66
deaths, making the percentage of recoveries 18.5.In these cases the
operative procedure was a final measure, and the mischief had been done
almost if not quite in its entirety.The statistics of Waring are
concerned with a period anterior to 1850.Although they demonstrate the
value of the trocar and evacuation of the abscess, as compared with the
results of the natural course of the disease, the far greater success
of the treatment by the aspirator is shown by the statistics of recent
times.Thus in McConnell's[116] 14 cases, also of India, in which the
aspirator was used to empty the sac, 8 recovered and 6 died.The
statistics of Waring may also be profitably compared with those of
Condon,[117] in which, of 8 cases of abscess evacuated by the
aspirator, 4 recovered, or 50 per cent.They may also be compared with
Sach's[118] cases, 21 in number, of which 8 recovered, or 38 per cent.,
and with the cases of De Castro[119] of Alexandria, who reports 22
large abscesses operated on, the proportion of cures being 31.8 per
100, and 10 small abscesses, the proportion of cures being 70 per 100.In a case seen in consultation with Collins, in this city, last year,
the aspirator was used by us about three months after the symptoms of
abscess declared themselves.About a quart of bloody pus was drawn off
at once, the opening sealed, and no subsequent accumulation occurred,
the patient entirely recovering, for after a year he was seen
(December, 1884) in complete health.From these data we draw the
important conclusion that early operation is desirable.This fact may
be formulated in the expression: In all cases of hepatic abscess use
the aspirator whenever the presence of pus is made out.When the
abscess is large, and especially when communication is established with
the parietes of the abdomen, a free opening, followed by the insertion
of a drainage-tube, is the proper method to pursue.If the pus
reaccumulates, it is good practice to inject the cavity with tincture
or compound solution of iodine after the pus is drawn off, provided the
dimensions of the abscess are not too great.[Footnote 115: _An Inquiry into the Statistics of Abscess of the
Liver_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 116: "Remarks on Pneumatic Aspiration, with Cases of Abscess
of the Liver treated by this Method," _Indian Annals of Medical
Science_, July, 1872, quoted.][Footnote 117: _Lancet_, _supra_.][Footnote 118: _Ueber die Hepatitis der heissen Lander, etc._, von Dr.[Footnote 119: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, par le Docteur S. V. de Castro (d'Alexandrie
d'Egypte), Paris, 1870, p.As regards the mode of proceeding, the following are useful rules:
Ascertain, if possible, the existence of fluctuation; locate the point
where the walls of the abscess are thinnest; insert an
exploring-needle, and if the depot of pus is reached substitute a
trocar having a sufficient calibre to evacuate the contents of the
abscess; observe antiseptic precautions in respect to each detail of
the operative procedure, and after the removal of the canula or needle,
if a drainage-tube is not necessary, close the {1023} wound
antiseptically.If drainage is necessary, keep the cavity empty and use
proper solutions to prevent septic decomposition.When an abscess of
the liver is pointing, the best place to puncture is where the abscess
is most prominent and it walls thinnest, but if the accumulation of pus
is encysted and there is no attempt at effecting an exit, the
exploring-needle should be passed into the interior of the right lobe,
the most usual site of suppuration.If pus be reached, a larger trocar
may be inserted to evacuate the cavity thoroughly.Repeated insertion
of the needle-trocar is preferable when the abscess is small, but when
the accumulation is large and sufficiently firm attachments to the
abdominal parietes exist, a drainage-tube will be necessary.In what direction soever discharge of an abscess may take place, the
general indications are to support the powers of life by food and
stimulants.It is useful, by
the application of a firm flannel bandage, to keep the liver in its
proper position and maintain it there.When pointing of an abscess
occurs, a large flaxseed poultice is a soothing and a mechanically
supporting application.DEFINITION.--By the term acute yellow atrophy is meant an acute
affection of the liver, characterized by rapid wasting or degeneration
of the organ, accompanied by the systemic symptoms belonging to an
acute acholia or cholaemia.It is an acute, diffused inflammation, with
atrophy of the proper gland-elements.It has been called icterus
gravis, malignant icterus, hemorrhagic icterus, malignant jaundice,
etc.HISTORY.--Cases having a more or less exact resemblance to acute yellow
atrophy have been occasionally reported from the earliest period.Amongst English physicians, Bright[120] was one of the first to give an
accurate account of the clinical history of some well-defined cases.Rokitansky[121] was really the first to define the disease from the
pathological standpoint, and it was he who designated it acute yellow
atrophy, this term being intended to signify the nature of the
objective changes.The first treatise ever published on the disease as
a distinct morbid entity was the monograph of Horaezek,[122] which
appeared in 1843.Amongst the French, Ozonam in 1847 was the first to
recognize and describe the disease as a distinct affection, although
Andral[123] had several years before mentioned an affection of the
liver which corresponded in some of its features to this affection.In
1862, Wagner[124] asserted that many of the cases of acute yellow
atrophy were only examples of acute phosphorus-poisoning, and that no
real distinction exists between the two affections.This statement has
been warmly disputed by various German observers, but there is no doubt
a close resemblance between the two affections.[Footnote 120: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1836, vol.[Footnote 121: _Handbook of Pathological Anatomy_, Am.[Footnote 122: Quoted by Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious
Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 123: _Clinique medicale_, 1839, tome ii.[Footnote 124: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1862, p.CAUSES.--There can be no doubt that acute yellow atrophy is a very rare
disease, since so few examples are found post-mortem.In the course of
a very large experience in autopsical examinations I have met with but
{1024} one characteristic example.[125] According to Legg, it is "one
of the rarest diseases known to man."[Footnote 125: _General Field Hospital_, December, 1863.]Several theories have been proposed to explain the occurrence of this
affection, but without success.It has been ascribed to an excess in
the production of bile, to stasis in the bile, and to a sudden
saturation of the hepatic cells with biliary matters contained in the
portal vein.That these supposed causes are really influential in
producing the malady can hardly be entertained.That there is a
peculiar poison which has a causative relation to the disease is
rendered probable by the fact that a condition closely allied to this
disease is produced by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other
poisons.Is it not a ptomaine generated under unknown conditions in the
intestine?Especially does the morbid anatomy of phosphorus-poisoning
nearly agree in all its details with icterus gravis--so nearly that by
many German authorities they are held to be identical.Age has a certain influence in the causation of this disease.It is
rarely seen in early life, Lebert in a collection of 63 cases having
found only 2 before ten years of age, yet there has been a well-marked
case at three, and Hilton Fagge reports one at two and a half years of
age.Nevertheless, much the largest number occur between fifteen and
twenty-five years of age, and the maximum age may be fixed at sixty.The influence of sex in the pathogeny is most remarkable.It is true in
Lebert's collection of 72 cases there were 44 men and 28 women, but it
is now known that he did not properly discriminate in his selection of
supposed examples of the disease.The statistics of all other observers
are opposed to those of Lebert.Thus, in Frerichs' collection of 31
cases, carefully sifted to eliminate error, there were 22 women and 9
men.Legg has also collected 100 cases of acute yellow atrophy, and of
these 69 were women or girls.The most active period of life--from
twenty to thirty years of age--is the usual period for the appearance
of this disease.More than one-half of Lebert's cases occurred between
fifteen and twenty-five; and of Frerichs', two-thirds happened between
twenty and thirty years of age.In Legg's collection of 100 cases, 76
were between fifteen and thirty-five years of age.What is the
condition of women at this period in life which renders them so
susceptible to this malady?There can be no doubt that pregnancy is the
great factor.Of 69 cases especially interrogated on this point,
examined into by Legg, in 25 pregnancy was ascertained to exist.In
Frerichs' collection one-half were women in the condition of pregnancy.The period of pregnancy at which the disease appears varies from the
fourth to the ninth month, the greatest number occurring at the sixth
month.So long ago as 1848, Virchow drew attention to the remarkable
changes in the liver due to pregnancy.Sinety[126] has studied the
effect of lactation on the liver, and has ascertained the existence of
fatty degeneration.There is a form of jaundice which accompanies
menstruation, as shown by Senator,[127] Hirschberg, and others.These
facts indicate a certain relationship between the sexual system of the
female and the liver, but they do not indicate the nature of the
connection, if any exist, between this condition and acute yellow
atrophy.[Footnote 126: _De l'Etat du Foie chez les Femelles en Lactation_,
Paris, 1873 (pamphlet).][Footnote 127: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1872, p.615, "Ueber
Menstruelle Gelbsucht."]The influence of depressing emotions has been supposed to be effective
{1025} in producing this disease, but it is more than doubtful if such
a relationship exists.Lebert, however, refers 13 of his cases to this
cause, but Legg, who bases his statements on the study of 100
carefully-recorded cases, is sceptical regarding the effect of such
influences.Syphilis has in some instances appeared to be the
principal, if not the only, pathogenetic factor, and Legg[128] compares
the action of the virus of syphilis to the effect of phosphorus,
mercury, etc.[Footnote 128: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The anatomical changes occurring in this disease
indicate the existence of a systemic condition: the lesions are not
limited to the liver, but involve various other organs.The changes in
the liver should be first described, since the name of the disease is
derived from the alterations in this organ.As the name indicates, the
lesions are atrophic, but not all examples show this.In some cases
there is little change in the size of the organ; in others the wasting
is extreme; certainly in all typical examples the liver is reduced in
size.The variations in size observed are probably due to the stage at
which the inspection is made: if early, the organ may not be reduced in
size, may be even somewhat enlarged by the deposition of new material;
if later, the atrophic changes will be more or less pronounced.When
the atrophy has taken place, the size of the liver is reduced to
one-half, even to one-third, of its original dimensions; it is then
soft, almost like pulp, and cannot maintain its shape, but flattens out
on the table.The capsule is much wrinkled and the color of the organ
is yellowish, variegated by islets of reddish or brownish-red color,
these spots being somewhat depressed below the general surface and
having a firm texture.On section the boundaries of the lobules are
either lost or have become very indistinct, the line of section being
bloodless.The knife with which the sections are made becomes greasy.In some instances ecchymoses are discovered under the capsule, and
rarely hemorrhagic extravasations in the substance of the liver.The
bile-ducts are found intact, as a rule.The greatest change in the size
of the liver is observed in the left lobe.The duration of the disease,
as has been indicated above, has a marked influence over the size and
condition of the liver.The atrophic shrinking of the liver occurs more
decidedly after the ninth day.In general, the tissue of the liver is
soft and pulpy in consistence.On microscopic examination the most
important alterations are seen to have occurred in the hepatic cells;
ultimately, these cells disappear, being replaced by fatty and
connective-tissue detritus; but before this stage is reached important
alterations have taken place in the form and structure of these bodies:
the cells become granular and fatty, and lose their sharpness and
regularity of contour, especially at the periphery of the lobule, but
ultimately all the cells within the lobule undergo atrophic
degeneration.In this atrophic degeneration of the hepatic cells, in
their fatty degeneration, and ultimately entire disappearance, consist
the real proofs of the disease.The red islets of tissue already
alluded to consist of the fatty detritus mixed with crystals of
haematoidin.More or less increase of the connective tissue is noted in many of the
cases--increase of connective tissue with numerous young cells formed
around the vessels and the bile-ducts (Waldeyer[129]).The changes in
the {1026} liver would surely be incomplete without some references to
the minute organisms which play so important a part in modern
pathology.Waldeyer was the first to demonstrate the presence of
bacteria in the pigment-remains of the hepatic cells.Other observers
have been unable to detect them, so that at present the parasitic
origin of this affection remains sub judice.Daniel went to the hallway.Important changes also take place in the spleen, but the opinions on
this point are somewhat contradictory.Frerichs found the spleen
enlarged in most of his cases; Liebermeister, on the other hand, and
Legg,[130] find that the spleen is enlarged in about one-third of the
cases.When the atrophic changes occur in the liver, more or less
swelling of the splenic veins must occur in consequence of portal
obstruction.The peritoneum, especially the omental part, is the seat
of multiple ecchymoses, and the endothelium is fatty.The mesenteric
glands are usually swollen.More or less blackish or brownish fluid,
consisting of altered blood, is usually found in the stomach, and the
same, assuming a tar-like consistence, in the large intestine.Ecchymoses of rather small size are distributed over the stomach and
intestines.The epithelium of the stomach-glands is found granular and
disintegrating, and a catarrhal state of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane exists throughout.The secretions are never normal, and the
stools are wanting in bile or present a tarry appearance, due to the
presence of blood.[Footnote 130: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _supra_.]They consist essentially
in a granular and fatty degeneration of the tubular epithelium, whence
the altered appearance of the cortex.Multitudes of bacteria crowd the
pyramids.Ecchymoses also are found in the mucous membrane of the
pelvis of the kidney, in the bladder, and indeed all along the
genito-urinary tract.The muscular tissue of the heart is in a state of acute fatty
degeneration, beginning with a granular change which may at the outset
be of very limited extent and involve but few fibres.The endo- and
pericardium are studded with ecchymoses or marked by hemorrhagic
extravasations, and the pleura presents similar appearances, but not to
the same extent.The brain does not always show evidences of change, but in many
instances there are ecchymoses of the meninges; the walls of the
vessels are affected by fatty degeneration.The tissues of the body are more or less deeply stained with bile.The
pathological change on which the jaundice depends has been variously
stated, but the most probable explanation is that which refers it to
mechanical obstruction of the bile-ducts, either by catarrhal swelling
or fatty degeneration of the epithelium.Notwithstanding the prominence
of the hepatic symptoms, acute atrophy of the liver is probably only
one element in a constitutional morbid complexus.SYMPTOMS.--Acute yellow atrophy begins in two modes--the grave symptoms
preceded by mild prodromes, or the most serious symptoms appear at the
onset.The usual prodromes are
referable to the gastro-intestinal canal, and consist of loss of
appetite, nausea, vomiting, a bitter taste in the mouth, headache, and
general malaise.Indeed, the opening attack may be much like an {1027}
ordinary bilious seizure or acute gastro-duodenal catarrh or a sick
headache.In some cases the initial symptoms--nausea and
diarrhoea--appear to be induced by an indigestible article of food.Jaundice never fails to be present at some period, but is usually one
of the prodromic symptoms.It has no special characteristics by which
the gravity of the approaching seizure may be measured.It is usually
rather deep, and all parts are deeply stained, but the coloration may
be limited to the body and upper extremities.No change in pulse or
temperature, except the usual depression of both functions, is to be
observed; the urine is deeply stained with pigment, and the feces are
grayish, colorless, or parti-.The period of time elapsing before the serious symptoms come on is not
constant; from one week to several months have been the variations
observed.In a minority of the cases no prodromes have occurred, but
the grave symptoms have declared themselves at once.From the
appearance of the jaundice up to the onset of severe symptoms the time
has varied from two weeks to several months, but has rarely exceeded
three months.During this time there may be nothing to indicate the
gravity of the approaching symptoms; in fact, the case then, as at the
onset, seems to be one of simple gastro-duodenal catarrh associated
with catarrhal jaundice.The onset of serious symptoms is most usually
announced by dilatation of the pupil.If, therefore, in a case of
apparently simple catarrhal jaundice, especially in a pregnant female,
there should occur without apparent reason a marked and persistent
dilatation of the pupil, the possibility of the case being one of acute
atrophy should be apprehended.This symptom is not, alone, of
sufficient value to decide the character of the case, but then an
obstinate insomnia comes on, violent headache is experienced, there is
more or less confusion of mind, and jactitations or an extreme
restlessness occurs.When such pronounced nervous symptoms appear the
character of the attack is explained.Various divisions have been proposed to mark the type of the symptoms:
thus, the icteric period embraces the prodromal symptoms with jaundice;
the toxaemic period is that stage characterized by profound nervous
disturbances.Ozonam has divided the symptoms into those of the
prodromal period and those of the serious stage, the latter being
subdivided into the symptoms of excitation and those of collapse.There
may be no prodromal period, however; without any preliminary symptoms
the patient is suddenly seized with delirium and passes into a
condition of coma and insensibility, or the first evidence of serious
illness may be convulsions.It is probable, however, that in even the
most sudden cases mild prodromal symptoms had occurred, but were
overlooked.There is much variability in the symptoms of the toxaemic
period.There are three symptoms: excitement with delirium, sometimes
delirium ferox; coma, less or more profound; and convulsions.Legg has
numerically expressed the relative frequency of these symptoms thus: Of
100 cases of unquestionable acute atrophy, 76 had become comatose, 59
were delirious, and 32 had suffered convulsions.[131] According to the
same authority, delirium and coma were associated together in about
one-half of the cases, but in pregnant women coma often occurs alone
(Legg).Usually, when convulsions happen there has been either coma or
delirium.With these cerebral symptoms there are often present various
{1028} disturbances of motility and sensibility, such as local
convulsions, jactitations, hiccough, extreme restlessness, paralysis of
the sphincters, and incontinence of urine and feces or retention,
grinding of the teeth, exalted sensibility of the skin, or it may be
complete anaesthesia, severe itching of the surface, etc.[Footnote 131: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

During the toxaemic period, and directly dependent on the retention of
excrementitious matters in the blood, hemorrhages occur from the mucous
surfaces, from wounds, and into the various serous membranes.A changed
state of the blood being present in all cases of this disease, the
proportion in which extravasations take place is high--in about 71.3
per cent.according to Liebermeister, and 80 per cent.The latter author regards these estimates as rather low.When
hemorrhage occurs in the stomach in small amount, it presents itself as
coffee-grounds or as black vomit, and in the intestine in the form of
black, tarry stools or melaena.Hemorrhage may also occur from the
surface of an ulcer, from a fresh wound, a leech-bite, etc.; but the
most usual form of extravasation of blood after the gastro-intestinal
is epistaxis or bleeding from the nose.Women who abort, as they are
very apt to do when this disease comes on, may suffer from frightful
hemorrhage, and deaths have been thus caused.Various opinions have
been expressed as to the cause of the hemorrhagic condition--by some
attributed to the changes in the composition of the blood; by others to
the alterations of the vessel walls; both factors are doubtless
concerned.During the prodromic period the temperature of the body, as in the case
of ordinary uncomplicated jaundice, is rather depressed below normal,
sometimes as much as two degrees; but when the toxaemic stage comes on
the body-heat rises to a variable extent, but usually over 100 degrees
F. In some cases no febrile movement can be detected; in others a very
considerable elevation of temperature occurs, but very rarely attains
to 105 degrees or 106 degrees F. The pulse becomes very rapid, in some
instances rising to 140; but without any apparent cause it may fall
suddenly to 70 or 80, and these fluctuations may take place several
times a day.The rise of temperature and a very rapid pulse may come on
in the final coma only; and immediately after death, as Legg points
out, the body-heat may attain the maximum elevation.As the toxaemic period develops the tongue becomes dry, glazed,
fissured, sordes form on the teeth and lips, the breath becomes fetid,
and the breathing may assume the Cheyne-Stokes type.The nausea and
vomiting of the prodromal period persist, and the ominous
coffee-grounds appear in the rejected matters, or grumous masses--clots
acted on by the gastric juice--are brought up.Black, pitch-like, or
tarry stools, the result of hemorrhage, are passed toward the
end--involuntarily when liquid.When no blood is present the stools are
grayish and without bile.Constipation may be the condition instead of
diarrhoea in about one-third of the cases.Various eruptions have been observed on the skin, such as petechiae,
roseola, eczema, etc., but their very variety, as their occasional
appearance, indicates their accidental relationship to the disease.The urine is much altered in character, but it is usually acid in
reaction, although it has been observed neutral or alkaline.The
specific gravity is at or nearly normal, and it has a deep-brownish or
bilious hue {1029} due to the presence of bile-pigment.The most
important change in the composition of the urine is the diminished
quantity of urea or its entire disappearance; the phosphates, and
especially the chlorides, are also usually diminished in amount; and
albumen and leucin and tyrosin appear to a lesser or greater extent,
together with hyaline, fatty, and granular casts.Although the observations are somewhat contradictory, it seems pretty
definitely established that the blood is more or less altered in
composition, morphological and chemical.The red corpuscles are
diminished in amount, and often deformed; the white corpuscles are
increased; and excrementitious products--urea, leucin, tyrosin, and
cholesterin--are found in greater or less quantity.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Although, as a rule, the course of
acute atrophy is rapid, it is not invariably so.In some instances the
prodromic symptoms have continued through several months, but,
according to Thierfelder, one-half of the cases terminate in from three
to five weeks, and in only 10 per cent.The course of the disease is extremely rapid in pregnant
females, rarely extending beyond the second week.An extended course of
the disease is due to delay in the prodromic stage, the toxaemic period
being always absolutely and relatively shorter.In the condition of
pregnancy the danger is increased by the hemorrhages, and the early
termination is due chiefly to this factor.When the duration of the
disease is protracted and its evolution normal, the accumulation of
hepatic excrementitious matters sets up cerebral disturbance, which
becomes a pronounced feature of the case.As in the
course of the disease the hepatic cells undergo solution and
disintegration, their restoration can hardly be regarded as possible,
certainly not probable.Any curative result must, then, be wrought in
the prodromic period, when the diagnosis must be viewed with some
mistrust.DIAGNOSIS.--George Harley[132] maintains the singular doctrine that
acute yellow atrophy is only the "sporadic form of the contagious
jaundice of the tropics," or yellow fever.He bases his opinion on the
identity of their symptoms, pathological anatomy, mortality, and
contagious character; for he affirms that acute yellow atrophy may
exhibit contagious power in temperate climates.[Footnote 132: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.As acute yellow atrophy comes on as an ordinary catarrhal jaundice, it
is impossible to distinguish it from the latter affection during the
prodromal period.When cerebral symptoms, black vomit, and tarry stools
appear, the area of hepatic dulness very decidedly diminishes, and
leucin and tyrosin replace urea in the urine, acute atrophy may be
suspected.Acute phosphorus-poisoning, as regards its symptomatology and morbid
anatomy, does not differ from acute yellow atrophy, and many cases of
the latter have been mistaken, it is supposed, for the former.To
distinguish between them the history of the case must be carefully
ascertained.When, after the prodromal symptoms, which may not be accurately
diagnosticated, there occurs a rapid decline in the area of hepatic
dulness, hemorrhages take place from the mucous surfaces, stupor and
delirium {1030} supervene, and urea disappears from the urine, being
replaced by leucin and tyrosin, there can be no difficulty in coming to
a conclusion: the case must be one of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--It was formerly supposed that a case of acute yellow
atrophy must necessarily prove fatal, but this opinion must now be
modified, since examples of cure of supposed cases have been reported
from Oppolzer's clinic,[133] by Lebert,[134] by Harley,[135] and
others.As at the onset the symptoms cannot be distinguished from a
bilious attack or from catarrhal jaundice, the treatment must be
appropriate to these states.When the serious symptoms begin, a large
dose (scruple j) of quinine should be at once administered, and half
the quantity at regular intervals to keep up the cinchonism.Phosphate
of soda, with some arseniate and such mild hepatic stimulants as
euonymin, iridin, etc., should be given to maintain a gentle aperient
action.Experience has proved that active or drastic cathartics do harm
rather than good; on the other hand, mild laxatives, especially those
having cholagogue action, seem to do good.[Footnote 133: Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

[Footnote 134: _Ibid._]

[Footnote 135: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.Important symptoms arising during the toxaemic period require remedies
to combat them.Nausea and vomiting, and also diarrhoea, are best
relieved by carbolic acid and bismuth in combination.Hemorrhage
requires, when intestinal, the chloride and perchloride of iron; when
from other mucous surfaces, ergotin, gallic acid, and other
haemostatics.The depression of the vital forces should be treated by
small and frequently-repeated doses of alcohol, by quinine, by iron,
and, under some conditions, by digitalis.After the disintegration of
the hepatic cells has been produced no remedies can be of any service.Until this occurs, however, it seems to the author well worth while to
attempt to stay the destruction by the administration of those remedies
which, by their accumulation in that organ, indicate a special affinity
for its tissue.These drugs are phosphorus, antimony, gold, silver, and
mercuric chloride.By the timely administration of one or more of these
would it not be possible to stay the progress of the atrophic
degeneration?The Liver in Phosphorus-Poisoning.DEFINITION.--Poisoning by phosphorus may seem to be a toxicological
question rather than a merely hepatic disease, but as the morbid
complexus thus induced is so similar to acute yellow atrophy that the
conditions are regarded as identical by many of our German colleagues,
it is necessary to enter into some details regarding it.PATHOGENY.--Phosphorus-poisoning occurs at any period from youth to old
age, but is most common from twenty to thirty years of age.Women seem
more inclined to effect self-destruction in this way than are men,
probably because phosphorus matches are so readily obtained.Children
may munch match-heads in a spirit of mischief.That form of chronic
poisoning seen in workmen in match-factories, and consisting in
necrosis of bone, etc., does not come within the scope of the present
inquiry.A body poisoned by phosphorus does not exhibit a tendency to
putrefactive decomposition within the usual period.The tissues are
more or less {1031} deeply stained by bile-pigment, and this coloration
extends to pathological fluids as well.The serous and mucous membranes
contain points of blood-extravasation, but they are especially numerous
in the serous membranes.Hemorrhages of this kind are due to two
causes--to the disorganization of the blood, and to fatty degeneration
of the arterioles.The heart is also more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration, the muscles granular, the striations obscure or
obliterated, and the whole soft and easily torn.The spleen is usually
enlarged--often, indeed, to twice its natural size.The liver presents
highly-characteristic alterations.When death occurs early the organ is
generally enlarged, infiltrated with fat, the connective tissue
undergoing hyperplasia; but in more advanced cases atrophy has taken
place, the cells have disappeared and are replaced by fat-granules,
crystals of leucin and tyrosin, connective tissue, etc.--in fact, the
changes characteristic of acute yellow atrophy.The jaundice has been
variously interpreted.As the bile-ducts in advanced cases are found to
contain no bile, but only a colorless mucus, the advocates of a
haematogenic jaundice hold that the jaundice is due to a failure of the
liver to excrete the biliary principles in the blood; whilst the
opponents of this view maintain the existence of an obstruction in the
ultimate ducts.Harley[136] has recently brought forward some strong
facts and arguments--which we believe can be successfully
controverted--maintaining the former view.The jaundice of
phosphorus-poisoning, if Harley's opinion prove to be correct, must be
regarded as a haematogenic jaundice.[Footnote 136: _Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

The mucous membrane of the stomach, as might be supposed, is more or
less ulcerated or in an advanced state of catarrh, and the gastric
glands are affected by fatty degeneration.The kidneys are affected in a similar manner to the liver; the
epithelium is fatty and sometimes detached, and the same process is
found to occur in the vessels and epithelium of the cortex.SYMPTOMS.--Not only in the morbid anatomy, but in the symptoms, do we
find that a very remarkable resemblance exists between acute yellow
atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning.As phosphorus is usually swallowed in
bulk, some hours may elapse before the local symptoms begin, for the
contents of the stomach and the tough mucus lining the mucous membrane
may, and usually do, prevent immediate contact of the poison with the
mucous membrane.When the stomach is entirely empty the symptoms may
begin in an hour or two.The symptoms produced may be arranged in two
groups--those due to the local irritation excited by the poison; those
due to its systemic impression.In the first group belong burning in
the gullet, pain, nausea, and vomiting.According to Lewin,[137] who
has collected a number of cases for analysis, vomiting occurs in 26 out
of 32 instances of poisoning.Some hours--often, indeed, three or four
days--then elapse before the systemic symptoms begin.Vomiting, which
was for the time being suspended, occurs again, and instead of the mere
contents of the stomach, containing more or less phosphorus, blood,
somewhat changed by the gastric juice--chocolate- or as
coffee-grounds--appears in the vomited matters.The evacuations from
the bowels may at first, as the contents of the stomach, appear
phosphorescent, and afterward exhibit the appearances due to the
presence in them {1032} of altered blood.At this time, if the liver be
examined it will be found somewhat enlarged and tender to pressure, and
on or about the third day jaundice appears; but it should not be
overlooked that jaundice, as Bamberger[138] has shown, may be postponed
to the second or third week after the phosphorus has been taken.[Footnote 137: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xxi.514 _et seq._]

[Footnote 138: Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_,
_loc.cit._]

In favorable cases the area of hepatic dulness decreases and the
jaundice declines.In the fatal cases certain nervous phenomena become
prominent.There occur drowsiness, developing into coma, with
intercurrent attacks of delirium which may be of a maniacal character;
convulsions, spasmodic attacks, dilated pupils, and involuntary
evacuations.The disorganization of the blood and the fatty change in
the vessels are exhibited in the hemorrhages from the gastro-intestinal
mucous membrane.The nervous phenomena are due chiefly to the retention
in the blood of various excrementitious matters which it is the
function of the liver to separate from the blood.Flint's theory of
cholesteraemia has been so abundantly disproved that no one upholds it
at the present time, but the cerebral symptoms are properly referred to
the retention of all hepatic excrement.The temperature in phosphorus-poisoning rises from 99 degrees to 102
degrees F., but it may reach in severe cases to 103 degrees to 105
degrees F., and at death or immediately afterward to 105 degrees, even
to 107 degrees F. The same fact is true of acute yellow atrophy.With
the jaundice the pulse declines, but in the further progress of the
case, especially toward the close, the pulse becomes rapid and small.The changes occurring in the urine are highly significant.The amount
of urea decreases as the symptoms increase in severity, and leucin and
tyrosin take its place.If the case tends to recovery the urea again
increases in amount, but if the tendency is in the opposite direction
the quantity of urea steadily diminishes.Bile acids and bile-pigment
are found in quantity, and albumen is present in small amount.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Phosphorus-poisoning is necessarily
an acute affection, but the duration of cases is much influenced by the
form in which the poison is taken.If in a liquid and diffusible form,
as oleum phosphoratum, the local and systemic symptoms will develop in
a few hours, but if in solid masses, as particles of match-heads, many
hours (six to ten) may elapse before the local irritation begins.The
proportion of cures in phosphorus-poisoning varies from one-fourth to
one-half of the cases.Much depends, however, on the promptness and
efficiency of the treatment.The prognosis is the more favorable the
earlier proper measures of relief have been instituted.If the case has
proceeded to jaundice, hemorrhages, black vomit, etc.without the
administration of suitable antidotes, little can be expected from any
kind of treatment.DIAGNOSIS.--The history of any case involved in doubt is indispensable
to a correct conclusion.The phosphorescent appearance of the matters
vomited or passed by stool may make the differentiation comparatively
easy; but if the case has passed beyond this stage,
phosphorus-poisoning can be separated from acute yellow atrophy only by
the history of the case.If the fact of the administration of
phosphorus is successfully concealed, no differentiation can be made,
since {1033} even the best authorities hold to the identity of the
toxic symptoms produced by this poison and of the morbid anatomy, with
the symptoms and lesions of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--The poison should be evacuated as quickly as possible by
emetics and proper diluents.The best emetics are sulphate of copper,
apomorphia, and ipecacuanha, the antimonial and mercurial emetics being
unsuited, since their effects are similar to those of phosphorus.Oleaginous protectives do not prevent, but really favor, the absorption
of phosphorus.Decoctions of flaxseed, slippery elm, acacia, etc.are
suitable demulcents and protectives.The fatty matter in food, eggs,
etc.will have an injurious effect by promoting the solution and
absorption of the phosphorus, and should hence be excluded from the
diet.The most effective antidote is oleum terebinthinae, and the most
suitable preparation is the French acid oil.Freshly-distilled
turpentine appears to be almost if not entirely useless.It is probable
that the American oil which is old and has been exposed to the air for
many months will answer the purpose, but it cannot be too strongly
insisted on that the turpentine which has proved to be efficient in
phosphorus-poisoning is the French acid oil.Turpentine when exposed to
the air absorbs oxygen as ozone, and to this principle are probably due
the curative effects of old turpentine.Phosphorus when acted on by
this agent is converted into a spermaceti-like substance entirely
devoid of toxic power.As rapidly as possible the poison should be
acted on by the antidote, and then the stomach should be evacuated,
using, caeteris paribus, the sulphate of copper, since this forms an
insoluble phosphide with any portion of free phosphorus, whilst at the
same time it empties the stomach of its contents.Although the
immediate results of the poison may be thus removed, the damage to the
red corpuscles and to the whole mass of the blood requires special
management.The success of transfusion, as practised by Jurgensen,[139]
proves that the substitution of fresh blood may save life when the
existing blood-supply is inadequate to the performance of its proper
functions.It follows that if the toxic effects of phosphorus have
continued for several days, blood-transfusion will be necessary in
those cases characterized by an inability to recuperate notwithstanding
the successful removal of the poison.[Footnote 139: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, No.For the inflammatory symptoms produced by the local action of
phosphorus, opium in some form is indispensable.This remedy is equally
valuable as a means of maintaining the vital resources and to prevent
the evil results of shock and inflammation.DEFINITION.--Under the term carcinoma of the liver are included primary
and secondary cancer of the liver.The malady with which we are now
concerned is the primary affection, occurring in the organ proper or in
some pathological new formation connected with it.ETIOLOGY.--Heredity is the most important factor.A careful
investigation of the reported examples demonstrates that from 15 to 20
per cent.owe their origin to hereditary influence clearly, and
probably {1034} considerably more are indirectly derived in this way
when the immediate connection may not be demonstrable.Next to
heredity, age must be regarded as the most important pathogenetic
influence, much the largest number occurring at from forty to sixty
years of age.It is a malady of advanced life, therefore, rather than
of youth or middle age.Excluding the female organs from consideration,
it is quite certain that sex has little special influence, and that
males and females are affected about equally.Primary cancer of the liver is comparatively infrequent, occurring in
not more than one-fourth of the cases.Frerichs collected 91 cases, and
of these 46 were secondary to cancer in organs having vascular
communication with the liver.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Under the term cancer of the liver are included
several distinct forms of morbid growth, but united in the
characteristic of malignancy.From the merely clinical standpoint this
characteristic is the most decisive bond of union between them, and
serves as the point of departure in the study of this affection.Primary cancer of the liver is divisible into two forms: 1, as a
single, defined tumor; 2, as an infiltration through the whole mass of
the organ.[140] Secondary cancer occurs in nodular masses, and with
extreme rarity as an infiltration.The form of cancer is really the
same; the differences in structure are only apparent, the variations
being due to the relative proportion of cells, fibres, and vessels.If
the fibrous stroma is abundant and the cells small in quantity, the
form of structure approaches scirrhus; on the other hand, if the cells
largely preponderate, the type is encephaloid; if vessels predominate,
it is called telangiectatic.The usual form in cancer of the liver is
the soft, cellular variety, encephaloid or medullary.When the
cancerous new formation is nodular, the masses vary in size from a pea
to a child's head,[141] and are numerous inversely as their size.When
the cancer occurs as a solitary tumor, it may attain to enormous
dimensions.It has a spherical shape usually, protrudes from the
surface of the organ somewhat irregularly, and the overlying peritoneum
is thickened, cloudy, and adherent from a local inflammation.The
central portion, whether there be one, several, or many nodules, is
depressed, giving an umbilicated appearance to the tumor; and this
central depression is found to be soft, almost diffluent, and full of
juice.The fibrous stroma which extends through this central soft
material has a reticulated arrangement and a shining, fibrous
appearance.The cancerous masses are not confined to these nodules, but
extend into the surrounding hepatic structure, push their way into the
portal (especially the hepatic) veins, block the ducts, and invade the
lymphatic glands in the fissure of the liver.[Footnote 140: Virchow, _Krankhaften Geschwulste_, _loc.cit._; Perls,
_Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.448 _et seq._;
Frerichs, _A Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.281 _et seq._]

[Footnote 141: Forster, _Lehrbuch der Pathologischen Anatomie_, by
Seibert, Jena, 1873.]When the cancerous new formation takes the form of an infiltration of
the organ instead of distinct nodules, the liver is usually uniformly
enlarged and its outlines preserved.[142] The peritoneum is opaque,
thickened, and adherent.The organ is traversed by fibrous bands, and
the {1035} intervening portion is a soft, juicy pulp, stained by the
imbibition of bile.In extreme cases hardly any portion of the proper
hepatic tissue remains, but is replaced by a cancerous new formation
having the same shape.[Footnote 142: Perls, _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lvi.448 _et seq._]

As regards the minute structure of cancer of the liver, it may be
regarded as a degeneration (cancerous) of the proper gland-cells and of
the epithelium of the bile-ducts.As cancer develops in the liver it is
to be noted that the cellular elements preponderate over the fibrous or
the stroma, and hence the new formation presents the characteristics of
softness, rapid growth, and a multitudinous cellular hyperplasia.As
regards the form of the new cells, it cannot now be doubted that they
are descendants of the secretory gland-cells and of the epithelial
lining of the ducts.According to some observers, it is to the
proliferation of the proper gland-cells that the new formations owe
their origin; according to others, to the hyperplasia of the cells
lining the ducts.As the growth of the new formation can take place
only through an adequate blood-supply, it becomes very important to
ascertain its source.There can be little doubt that primary cancer of
the liver receives its nutrient supply through the hepatic artery, in
connection with which new capillaries form in the pathological tissue.Secondary cancer of the liver is the usual form of the specific
manifestation.From the merely clinical standpoint the primary
affection is the more important.From the pathological point of view
the secondary implication of the liver may be a true metastasis or a
mere communication by contiguity of tissue.The most usual metastasis
occurs from epithelial cancer of the face (Schuppel), but the ordinary
communication of the new formation is from primary cancer of the
stomach, intestine, pancreas, mesentery, etc.The cancer elements, as
the author has several times verified, crowd the lymphatics and veins,
and through these channels reach the liver and other parts.As the
cancer elements in the case of secondary implication of the liver are
distributed chiefly by the portal vein, it follows that there must be
numerous secondary foci and multiple nodes.Cancerous infiltration
under these circumstances is the rarest possible form for the new
growth to take.The size and number of nodes forming in these cases of
secondary implication of the organ vary greatly--from two or three to
twenty, or a hundred, or even more.As regards the form, structure, and
ultimate behavior of the secondary formation, they do not differ from
the primary.As respects the relative proportion of stroma and cellular
elements--fibres and cells--they vary greatly, some presenting the firm
texture of a predominating fibrous stroma, others the softness and
ready diffluence of the excessive cellular production.The latter is
undoubtedly the usual condition, and when the nodular masses are
incised an abundant creamy juice exudes.With the development of these
nodules an increase in the size of the liver takes place and the organ
has an uneven and indurated feel.As the cancerous masses develop the
proper hepatic structure undergoes atrophy, and finally little is left
of the organ but the cancerous new formation.The blood-vessels,
lymphatics, and peritoneal investment are invaded, the first mentioned
most decidedly; and especially are organized exudations the favorite
seats of cancer new formations, those, for example, about the
gall-bladder and cystic duct resulting from repeated attacks of passage
of calculi.{1036} Secondary changes take place in the cancerous nodes.As the
cells develop pressure is brought to bear on the vessels supplying them
and on each other, with the result of fatty degeneration of the central
portion, which effects the change in the form of the nodules and in
their consistence, already mentioned.The blood-supply to the cancerous
nodes in the liver is derived from the hepatic artery, as Frerichs has
determined by carefully-made injections; they also are new formations
of exceedingly delicate structure, and form a network about the
periphery of each mass or node.By reference to these anatomical
considerations it is easy to understand the failure of nutrition of the
central portions of the nodes.Pigment cancers of the liver are rare as secondary formations, and
excessively infrequent as primary formations.They are, properly
speaking, melano-sarcomas (Schuppel).They are more often metastatic
than merely secondary--that is, transferred from different parts, as in
the case of melanotic sarcoma of the choroid--than due to neighboring
disease transferred by contiguity of tissue.This variety of cancer, so
called, takes the form of multiple nodes or of diffused infiltration,
the former more frequently; but both modes of development may go on at
the same time.The nodes vary in size from a pea to a child's head,
have a grayish, brownish, or blackish tint, and exude on section a
fluid not creamy like true cancer-juice, but rather watery and
containing black particles floating in it.In the case of diffuse
infiltration the pigment masses are thoroughly distributed through the
original hepatic tissue.In both forms the size and weight of the organ
are enormously increased.In the case of the melanotic infiltration the
whole organ is uniformly enlarged, reaching in a few months the
enormous size of twelve to twenty pounds.Sarcomas also occur very rarely as primary growths in the liver, but
secondary sarcomas are more frequent.There are fibro-sarcoma,
lympho-sarcoma, and osteo-sarcoma as secondary deposits, the first
being very firm in consistence, the second soft and medullary, and the
last of hard, bony consistence.SYMPTOMS.--We are especially concerned here with primary cancer of the
liver.The secondary disease is so obscured by the main and primary
lesion that a diagnosis may be impossible.Furthermore, the progress of
the original disease is that which demands immediate consideration.As,
therefore, the secondary implication of the liver is of relatively
trifling importance, and only an incident in the course of the main
disease, the matter for consideration now is primary cancer of the
liver.It is the fact that in some, even a considerable proportion, of the
cases the onset and progress of cancer of the liver are very obscure.For some time the symptoms may be of the vaguest description.The usual
history is this: A person of forty to sixty years begins to fail in
flesh and strength, becomes sallow, has disorders of digestion, pain
and uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, and the bowels are now
confined, now relaxed.The abdomen, notwithstanding the general loss of
flesh, increases in size, and the superficial veins are enlarged; very
considerable pain is experienced in the right hypochondrium, and often
extreme tenderness to pressure is a pronounced symptom.The pains are
not limited to the hepatic region, out extend widely from this point in
all directions.On palpation the {1037} liver is found to be enlarged,
its texture indurated, and its outline irregular and nodular, and
pain--often, indeed, quite severe--is developed by pressure.The condition of the liver on palpation is best ascertained by suddenly
depressing the abdominal wall with the tips of the fingers arranged in
a line.Displacing thus the movable bodies in the cavity, the liver is
quickly reached, and nodules, if they exist, are readily felt.If the
new formation has developed from exudations about the gall-bladder and
cystic duct, it may be felt by suddenly depressing the walls of the
abdomen over this organ in the usual position of the fissure.In the case of general cancerous infiltration of the organ, with the
remarkable enlargement which occurs in such cases, there will be
present an obvious distension of the right hypochondrium; the
intercostal spaces will be forced outward and the arches of the ribs
rendered more prominent; the area of hepatic dulness, both vertical and
transverse, will be increased; and the limits of dulness will move with
a full inspiration downward, and with a full expiration upward.This
mobility of cancer-nodules of the liver with the inspiratory and
expiratory changes serves to distinguish them from tumors of the
abdominal walls.Seen early, the changes in the size of a nodule or of
the liver itself may be noted from week to week,[143] especially in
cases of rapidly-growing cancer.[Footnote 143: Murchison, _Clinical Lectures_, p.As the cancerous new formations extend into the portal system within
the liver, obstruction to the portal circulation results from the
blocking of the blood-current.Also, interference in the portal
circulation arises by compression of the vessels from without, either
through the accumulation of cancer-products in the liver or by the
enlargement of the lymphatics in the fissure of the organ.In what way
soever it may be produced, the practical fact remains that ascites is a
frequent symptom, occurring in somewhat more than one-half of the
cases.It may be a clear serum
containing a small proportion of albumen; it may be  by bile or
be of a deeper greenish or reddish hue; it may contain flocculi of
lymph and numerous leucocytes floating in it; and the ordinary serum
may be rendered cloudy and be filled with shreds of exudation in
consequence of peritonitis, or bloody because of hemorrhage from a
softening nodule.When the fluid is considerable in amount the
difficulty of ascertaining the condition of the liver is greatly
enhanced, and symptoms due to the interference of the fluid with the
action of various organs are introduced into the complexus of morbid
signs.Especially is the upward pressure of the ascitic fluid, and the
consequent interference in the movements of the lungs and heart, a
source of considerable distress.First, a local and afterward a general
peritonitis ensues as a consequence of the extension outwardly of the
new formations to the peritoneal layer, and its implication by
contiguity of tissue or the rupture of a spreading fungous growth and
hemorrhagic extravasation into the cavity.The peritoneal complication
is not only a serious addition to the sufferings experienced by the
patient, but it adds to the difficulties of a diagnosis.In the case of
a celebrated savant who died of cancer of the liver (seen by the
writer) there was such a pronounced peritonitis that the diagnosis made
by the attending physician was chronic peritonitis.When this
complication occurs, there takes place {1038} a decided increase in the
local tenderness, and this increased sensibility to pressure quickly
extends over the abdomen, causing a general exquisite tenderness.Besides this tenderness characteristic of most cases of peritonitis,
distension of the abdomen and the decubitus peculiar to this state are
obvious symptoms.It is therefore clear that the occurrence of
peritonitis not only contributes to the severity and painfulness of the
case, but seriously complicates the diagnosis.It has been already stated that pain in the right hypochondrium is a
nearly constant symptom in cancer of the liver.With the initial
symptoms, uneasiness, heaviness, a sense of pressure in the hepatic
region are experienced, and as the case progresses more or less acute
pain develops as a rule.In cases of cancer
involving the deeper portion of the liver there may be little pain, and
in some rare cases of cancer involving the external part of the
liver--the capsule and peritoneum--but little pain is experienced.In
much the largest proportion of cases the pain is severe, and the
production of any considerable pain means the implication of the
hepatic plexus of nerves or the hepatic peritoneum.It follows, then,
that the pain in the former case is not limited to the locality of the
disease, but is more or less widely distributed through the anatomical
relations of the hepatic plexus, being felt in the epigastrium, the
walls of the chest, the shoulders, etc.In secondary cancer of the liver, following cancer of the stomach,
vomiting is a constant symptom, but also in those cases of primary
disease in which the left lobe is especially enlarged, relatively, are
nausea and vomiting pronounced symptoms.At the onset of the malady the
appetite fails and a gastro-intestinal catarrh is set up.More or less
catarrh of the bile-ducts also ensues.The interference with nutrition
thus occasioned is enhanced in those cases in which the obstruction of
the ducts is sufficient to prevent the escape of bile into the
intestine.Jaundice is not a constant symptom, occurring in little more
than one-third of the cases.When it occurs, the peculiar stools are
present and the intestinal digestion is deranged, as in cases of
ordinary obstruction to the ducts.In two cases of cancer of the liver
occurring in the writer's practice, and examined by post-mortem, there
were calculi present in the gall-bladder; in one case the principal
calculus was egg-shaped and the size of a pullet's egg.The nutrition rapidly fails from the beginning of cancer of the liver.The downward pace is accelerated when the gastro-intestinal digestion
fails and vomiting occurs after taking food.The skin becomes dry and
wrinkled, and if not jaundiced has a peculiar tint, varying in depth of
color from an earthy or fawn-like hue to a deep bronze.Failure of
strength is a pronounced symptom from the beginning, and is out of
proportion to the loss of flesh.As the wasting advances the decline of
strength is accounted for, but the feeling of weakness and the distaste
for exertion which occur so early are very significant signs of
internal cancer, although they do not indicate the position of the
neoplasm.The urine declines in amount as the case progresses.It is usually very
high-, contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, and other
forms of pigment produced by conditions not at present known.Sometimes
albumen is present, and leucin and tyrosin rarely.{1039} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As has been already set
forth, cancer of the liver may present so few really distinctive
symptoms as to escape recognition.Under favorable circumstances the
diagnosis may be comparatively easy.In forming an opinion it is useful
to review the whole course of the malady and draw conclusions not only
from the characteristic signs, but from the development of the symptoms
as a whole.A case of cancer of the liver occurs usually after the middle period of
life.The person so affected begins to decline in flesh and strength,
has uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, disorders of digestion, and
begins to have a pallid or earthy hue of the countenance.Presently,
much pain is felt in the hepatic region, the organ distinctly enlarges,
and some effusion of fluid and much flatus increase the dimensions of
the abdomen.Much tenderness, often exquisite sensibility, is produced
by pressure over the liver, and often over the whole abdomen.By
careful palpation nodules can be made out and their growth noted in
those cases free from peritoneal inflammation.The abdominal swelling
and tenderness incommodes the lungs, and a semi-erect decubitus is
assumed to relieve the pressure on them; the breathing becomes short,
catching, hurried, and painful, and sometimes a most distressing
hiccough is superadded to the other sufferings.Jaundice appears, or the earthy hue of the skin deepens
into a bronze discoloration.The case may be terminated by some
intercurrent disease--by an attack of pleuritis, pneumonia, by
peritonitis from rupture or perforation, by intra-peritoneal
hemorrhage, by an exhausting diarrhoea.The natural termination is by
gradual failure of the powers, by marasmus, the immediate cause of
death being due to cerebral anaemia, to failure of the heart from fatty
degeneration of the cardiac muscle, from thrombosis of the portal vein,
from the development of a hemorrhagic state, and hemorrhages from the
various mucous surfaces, etc.The duration is much influenced also by
the character of the cancer, whether scirrhous or medullary.The latter
are not only more rapidly growing, more destructive of the hepatic
tissue, and more rapidly distributed to neighboring organs, but more
quickly perforate the capsule and excite a fatal result by hemorrhage
or by peritonitis.The average duration of cancer of the liver is
variously stated.Having reference to my own personal observation,
controlled by the experience of other observers, the duration is from
three to nine months, one year being exceptional.There are cases in
which the symptoms are very acute, the progress rapid, the whole course
from the initial symptoms to the termination being completed in from
two to three months.It need hardly be observed that no case of cancer
of the liver has been cured.If
any case has seemed to be cured, it may be asserted with confidence
that cancer of the liver did not exist.DIAGNOSIS.--The differential diagnosis is concerned, first, with the
existence of cancer; second, with its form.As cancer causes
enlargement of the liver in two textural conditions--namely, uniformly
smooth, and nodular--it must be differentiated from other diseases
producing similar results.Amyloid disease and echinococcus cysts
present us types of the former; cirrhosis and syphilis, of the latter.The history of the amyloid disease and of the echinococcus cyst is very
different, and both {1040} develop much more slowly.Amyloid disease of
the liver arises simultaneously with the same form of degeneration in
other organs, and is connected with suppurative disease of some kind,
with syphilis, with chronic malarial poisoning, etc., and may occur at
any age.Echinococcus cysts enlarge painlessly and do not impair the
vital forces; the liver is elastic, and under favorable circumstances
presents by palpation the purring-tremor symptom.Cirrhosis may have to
be differentiated at two periods--during the time of enlargement,
which, however, is rather brief; and during the stage of contraction
and nodulation.The history in cancer and in cirrhosis is different:
the age, the habits of life, the rate of hepatic change, are opposed in
the two diseases; the diminution in size with nodulation is
characteristic of cirrhosis; enlargement with nodulation belongs to
cancer.The rapid progress of cancer, the wasting, the debility, the
cachexia, serve to distinguish it from all other affections of the
liver except acute yellow atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning; both,
however, are so different in history and development as not to require
differentiation.It may be quite impossible in latent cases to
distinguish primary cancer of the liver from secondary, but in those
examples of the disease occurring in the stomach, intestines, and
pancreas there is usually an antecedent history of the primary malady
which distinctly separates it in point of time and the character of the
symptoms from the secondary implication of the liver.Cancer of the
gall-bladder, and especially of the organized exudation about it, may
not be readily separated from cancer of the pancreas or of the
duodenum.In doubtful cases the history of attacks of hepatic colic
becomes an important element in making the differentiation.TREATMENT.--As we are not in possession of a cure for cancer, the
treatment of cancer of the liver must be palliative.Anodynes to
relieve pain, paracentesis of the abdomen to remove accumulation of
fluid which causes distress, carbolic acid to check nausea and
vomiting, and the usual haemostatics for hemorrhage, are the measures
most necessary.In fact, the treatment must be throughout
symptomatic--for the relief of symptoms as they arise.DEFINITION.--By amyloid liver is meant a deposit in the cells of the
organ, in its vessels and interstitial tissue, of a peculiar albuminoid
matter called amyloid because of a superficial resemblance to
starch-granules.Various designations have been applied to this
condition of the organ; thus it has been entitled waxy liver and
lardaceous liver, because of the apparent resemblance to wax and lard
respectively.CAUSES.--There exists in the blood a peculiar material, albuminoid in
form, applied in the normal state to the structure of
tissue--dystropodextrin, as it is called by Seegen--which, when
precipitated under certain conditions not now known, assumes the
peculiar appearance with which we are now familiar under the term
amyloid.The character of the amyloid matter was first distinctly set
forth in 1858 by Virchow, who also discovered the characteristic
reaction by which it can always be detected.The reaction to iodine
gave to the material the designation amyloid, or starch-like, by which
it is chiefly known.The {1041} circumstances inducing the deposit of
this material are by no means clearly understood.It has long been
known that suppuration, especially in connection with bone, has had a
distinct influence.Syphilis, especially the tertiary lesions
accompanied by pus-formation, has an evident causative relation.Chronic malarial infection has a more distant and doubtful, but still
recognized, power to develop this morbid state.Of the various causes
above mentioned, the most frequent is the suppuration of pulmonary
cavities.In regard to the influence of this, however, it must be
remembered that no form of suppurative disease is so common.The
relative frequency of the association between suppurating cavities and
amyloid disease is not greater than long-standing necrosis with an
extensive sequestrum is with the same state; but the actual number of
the former is greater.Amyloid disease of the liver is most frequent
between the ages of ten and thirty, but it may occur at any age, the
period in life being determined by the operation of the causes.Thus,
Frerichs' statistics are: under ten there were 3 cases, from ten to
twenty there were 19, and from twenty to fifty there were 37 cases.Men
are, relatively to sex, more frequently attacked, and in the proportion
of three-fourths, but this difference means, of course, the character
of men's occupations and their greater liability thereby to the
accidents and diseases incident to such employments.Besides the pathogenetic factors above mentioned, it may be well to
refer in this connection to the effect of long-standing neoplasms.It
has been found that amyloid disease is produced in some subjects by the
cachexia resulting from the slow development and persistence of such a
new formation.The special character of the neoplasm is of less
importance in respect to this condition than the constitutional
condition--the cachexia--induced by its slow growth and interference
with nutrition.Although long-standing disease, especially of a
suppurative kind, is known to be necessary to cause amyloid disease,
Cohnheim[144] has lately published some facts which seem to prove that
the degeneration may occur more speedily than has been heretofore
supposed.He has shown, contrary to the previously-accepted view, that
amyloid degeneration may follow in three months after the reception of
a gunshot wound.He records three cases in which the amyloid deposits
ensued in six, five, and three months, respectively.[Footnote 144: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.271 _et seq._, "Zur
Kentniss der Amyloidentartung."]According to the author's observation, a peculiar somatic type is
either necessary to, or at least is greatly promotive of, the amyloid
degeneration.If, for example, the same suppurative process occurs in a
person of a blond and lymphatic type and in another of brunette and
nervo-muscular type, the former will be much more likely to suffer from
amyloid change than the latter."The gelatinous progeny of albuminous
parents" is the mode of expression used to designate this particular
type.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--To use the term amyloid liver is rather
misleading, since this indicates the restriction of the morbid process
to the liver, whereas it is perfectly well known to be rather widely
distributed through various organs and tissues of the body.The term
amyloid is itself confusing, since the albuminoid material so
designated is not really starch-like.The corpora amylacea, so called,
differ materially from starch-granules, and still more from the amyloid
matter.According to {1042} Wagner,[145] these substances "have nothing
in common."In the study of the amyloid deposit it has not been
possible to separate it from the tissue in which it is imbedded; hence
the published analyses of this peculiar material are probably far from
correct.However, it has been rendered probable that the amyloid
deposit has close affinities with fibrin.One of the theories--that of
Dickinson of London--assumes that this material is fibrin deprived of
the potash associated intimately with it.According to Seegen,
dystropodextrin, a material existing in normal blood, agrees with
amyloid matter in its most essential characteristics.Although
Dickinson's theory is not tenable, it has served a useful purpose in
showing the close affinity of fibrin with this pathological product.What view soever may be entertained of its nature, it is certain that
the material to which we apply the term amyloid is of albuminous
origin.Under circumstances with which we are now unacquainted this
material is deposited from the vessels, and, instead of undergoing
organization and contributing to the structure of tissues, remains
unorganized and unappropriated.It is known that this deposition of the
amyloid material is related to the process of suppuration and to
certain cachexiae, but the intermediate steps remain unknown and
inexplicable.[Footnote 145: _A Manual of General Pathology_, by Prof.325 _et seq._]

The amyloid matter is first exuded into the coats of the finest
ramifications of the hepatic artery, and therefore the first appearance
of the disease is in the middle zone of the lobules.In this respect
pathologists are agreed: that the amyloid deposits first appear in the
walls of the vessels.Wagner maintained, in opposition to Virchow, that
the exudation is limited to the vessels and does not extend to the
hepatic cells, which perish by pressure and consequent atrophy.It seems most probable, however, that
the ramifications of the hepatic artery and all the capillaries of the
lobule are affected, and that the deposits in them lead to atrophic
degeneration of the cells.In consequence of this extensive implication of the vascular system of
the liver important changes occur in the size, density, and appearance
of the liver.The organ is greatly enlarged in all its diameters.When
felt through the walls of the abdomen its outline is distinct, it is
firm, even hard, to the sense of touch, and it projects from a finger's
breadth to a hand's breadth below the margin of the ribs.The increase
of size of the amyloid liver is very great, attaining in weight, on the
average, twice that of the normal organ; but this size may be largely
exceeded in exceptional instances.In respect to shape and outline the
amyloid liver does not differ from the normal organ; for although its
dimensions are increased, its relations to the parts adjacent are not
altered.The weight of the amyloid liver may reach ten, twelve, even
sixteen pounds avoirdupois.The color of the amyloid liver is very
different from that of the normal organ: instead of having the
reddish-brown tint, it becomes grayish, yellowish, or reddish-gray.In
consistence the amyloid liver is firm and rather elastic and doughy,
and on section the margins of the incision are well defined, even
sharp.A very characteristic feature of the cut surface is its
paleness, anaemia, or bloodlessness, and scarcely any blood is exuded,
even from the large vessels.The appearance of the incised surface of
the liver has been described by comparison with various substances:
according to one, it is waxy; according to another, it is lardaceous.A
thin {1043} section of a part of the liver far advanced in the amyloid
change is distinctly translucent, almost transparent; but a marked
difference is observable between the amyloid matter and the lobules
proper, even in the cases of extreme deposit.The lobules are separated
by an opaque yellow border, and the centre of each is marked by a spot
of a similar yellow color.The amyloid material is remarkable for its power to resist the action
of chemical agents and putrefactive decomposition.The test originally
proposed by Virchow--iodine--continues to be the most characteristic.Orth[146] suggests a method of applying it which is very excellent in
respect to the clearness with which the reaction is shown: A large,
thin section of the affected liver is placed in a saucer of water
containing some iodine, and after the reaction has taken place is laid
on a white plate.Iodine tincture, diluted or the compound solution, is
brushed over the affected region, when the amyloid matter assumes a
deep mahogany tint and the normal tissues a merely yellowish hue.The
distinctness of the reaction may be increased by brushing over the
iodized surface some dilute sulphuric acid, when the amyloid matter
takes a deep violet, almost black, color.[Footnote 146: _Diagnosis in Pathological Anatomy_, Riverside Press,
1878, p.Only a part of the organ--namely, the smaller vessels--may be involved
in the degeneration, and this may be restricted to patches or parts of
the organ.With the amyloid change there may be associated syphilitic
gummata, or the liver may be more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration or in cirrhosis.Those parts of the organ not invaded by
the disease are not often entirely normal; they are more or less
darkened in color by venous congestion, distinctly softer, etc.The
amyloid change is not limited to the liver, but extends to the kidneys,
lymphatic glands, the intestinal mucous membrane, etc.SYMPTOMS.--As the amyloid change in the liver is usually coincident
with a simultaneous alteration of other organs, and as the deposits
characteristic of the affection are dependent on long-previous disease
of an exhausting kind, it is not surprising that the subjects of this
affection present the evidences of a cachexia.To the effects of a
chronic malady we have added the complications growing out of the
amyloid change in the liver, associated, as it usually is, with amyloid
degeneration of other important organs.The symptomatic expression of amyloid liver is therefore mixed up with
various derangements that occur simultaneously, but especially with the
causes inducing the existing cachexia, with chronic suppuration of
pulmonary cavities, or in connection with diseased bone, with the
syphilitic cachexia, or with chronic malarial toxaemia.With what cause
soever the cachexia may be associated, the symptomatology of amyloid
liver is secondary to, or ingrafted on, the conditions produced by the
cachexia.The liver is enlarged in all well-marked cases from a
finger's breadth to a hand's breadth or more below the inferior margin
of the ribs; it is also firm to the touch, well defined, elastic, and
its margin rounded, but yet well defined.There is usually no
tenderness nor pain, and, without any uneasy sensations to indicate the
change taking place, the organ is found to have slowly enlarged,
sometimes to an extraordinary extent.Careful palpation may also
demonstrate an enlargement of the spleen.When the abdominal muscles
are relaxed and there is no swelling of the abdomen by flatus or
peritoneal effusion, the very considerable enlargement of {1044} the
liver can be readily ascertained.If the effusion is not so great as to
distend the abdomen unduly, the increased consistence and dimensions of
the liver can still be made out with comparative ease.The hepatic
functions are not always sufficiently disturbed to produce
characteristic symptoms.In a small proportion--scarcely one-tenth--of
the cases does jaundice appear, and when present it is due, usually, to
enlargement of the lymphatics in the hilus of the organ, and thus
directly compressing the hepatic duct.In the writer's experience,
although jaundice has not occurred, there was present a peculiar dark
earthy or bronzed tint of the skin, significant of chronic hepatic
troubles.Obstruction of the portal circulation is rather unusual, and
the explanation is to be found in the fact that the amyloid
degeneration occurs first in the radicles of the hepatic artery.In
about one-fourth of the cases ascites is present, but in a somewhat
larger proportion hemorrhoids, blackish, tarry stools, and other
evidences of portal congestion.When the intestinal arterioles are
attacked, an intractable colliquative diarrhoea comes on; the stools
are offensive, sometimes light from the absence of bile, sometimes dark
from decomposition or the presence of blood.When the stomach
arterioles are also involved, which is usual under these circumstances,
the blandest and simplest articles of diet will pass unchanged or
simply decomposed.Blood may be vomited sometimes in large quantity
from thrombic ulcers, but the matter ejected from the stomach when the
case is well advanced is a thin, watery fluid, faintly acid or neutral,
and greenish or brownish in color.An enlarged spleen is often present, produced by the same
conditions--by amyloid degeneration.The same change taking place in
the kidney, the urine becomes pale, abundant, of low specific gravity,
and albuminous.General dropsy supervenes in a majority of the cases
finally, due largely to the hydraemia; and of this condition ascites is
a part.In some cases enlargement of the abdomen is the first step in
the dropsical effusion, and may throughout be the most prominent, as
the author has seen.In other cases oedema of the feet and legs is the
first evidence of dropsy; in still others the dropsy is general from
the beginning.Amyloid liver may coexist with a fairly good state of the bodily
nutrition, but if digestion and assimilation be interfered with by any
of the causes above mentioned, the strength rapidly declines and
emaciation reaches an extreme degree.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As amyloid liver is never a
substantive affection, but secondary to some constitutional malady or
to long-continued suppuration, its course must be considered in
relation to the agency producing it.It is very silent in its origin
and progress, and causes no pronounced symptoms until it attains
considerable size and its functions are interfered with by the extent
of the deposits.The history of the affection to which it is secondary
therefore precedes the onset of the amyloid change and accompanies it
throughout.The enlarged organ, with the results of its enlargement in
altered functions of the abdominal organs, is a symptom superadded to
existing disturbances.The period elapsing in the course of a chronic
suppurative disease before the amyloid change occurs differs greatly in
different cases, and may be stated as from three months (Cohnheim's
case) to many years.Many of the cases terminate by an intercurrent
disease; others by uraemic {1045} convulsions; a very few by hemorrhage
from the stomach or intestines; and those pursuing their course
uninterruptedly, by exhaustion.By some a cure at the beginning of
the morbid deposits is regarded as possible, and examples of cures have
been reported.The writer has seen supposed cases of amyloid liver
terminate in recovery.There must always remain an impression that in
such instances an error of diagnosis was committed.Those of syphilitic
origin are probably more curable, but syphiloma of the liver may be
confounded with amyloid disease, and hence the cure may be referred to
the latter.DIAGNOSIS.--Amyloid degeneration of the liver may be confounded with
the various non-febrile enlargements of the organ.An important element
in making the differentiation is the history of suppuration in
connection with bone, with lung cavities, with constitutional syphilis,
with chronic malarial toxaemia, etc.From fatty liver, amyloid
degeneration is distinguished by the history as just sketched; by the
fatty tendencies of the body in the former, emaciation in the latter;
by the concomitant changes in the spleen, kidneys, and elsewhere; and
by the subsequent history, fatty liver terminating by a weak heart
usually, whilst the amyloid disease ends in the modes described in the
preceding paragraph.From hydatid disease, amyloid liver is
differentiated by the history, by the difference in the physical
characteristics of the enlargement, by the presence of the purring
tremor in the one, its absence in the other, and especially by the
subsequent course.In all doubtful cases the use of an aspirator-needle
and the withdrawal of some fluid containing the characteristic hooklets
of the echinococcus will serve to determine the nature of the growth.From cancer, amyloid liver is separated by the previous history, by the
nodular character of the enlargement, by the pain, and by the cachexia
and associated derangements.Whilst amyloid liver is secondary to
suppurative diseases, cancer is usually secondary to cancer of the
stomach or other organ within the limits of the portal circulation.TREATMENT.--As amyloid disease owes its origin to syphilis, to chronic
malarial toxaemia, to suppuration, these, so far as they are remediable
conditions, should be cured as speedily as may be, to prevent the
development of the amyloid disease or to arrest it if begun.Unfortunately, the condition of the liver is not recognized until the
morbid change is effected, and therefore practically irremediable.The treatment necessarily involves that of the morbid state to which
the amyloid deposits are owing.The syphilitic disease requires iodine
and mercury; the malarial, quinine, iodine and the iodides, eucalyptus,
iron, etc., according to the state of each case; and surgical diseases,
especially necrosis of bone, should be effectively treated by suitable
surgical expedients.The cause being removed if possible, what means,
if any, can be resorted to to cause the absorption of the amyloid
matter?The only specific plan of treatment hitherto proposed is that
of Dickinson,[147] based on his theory of the constitution of amyloid
matter; according to which the amyloid deposits consist of fibrin
altered by the separation of the potash and soda salts, which have been
eliminated in the pus.If this theory be admitted, the obvious
indication is to supply the alkaline materials.The cases reported by
Dickinson in which this theory was {1046} practically demonstrated were
not sufficiently improved to lend any empirical support to this method.[Footnote 147: _The Pathology and Treatment of Albuminuria_, p.214 _et
seq._]

The medicinal remedies which do any good are the iodides--notably the
iodides of ammonium, of iron, of manganese, etc., the compound solution
of iodine, and the double iodide of iron and manganese.As the
officinal ointment of the red iodide of mercury, rubbed in over the
splenic region, does so much good in chronic enlargement of the spleen,
it is probable that it will prove effective in this form of enlargement
of the liver.The writer has observed results from it in such cases
that justify him in strongly urging its employment.The method of its
application consists in rubbing perseveringly a piece of the ointment,
a large pea in size, over the whole hepatic area, and repeating it
daily until some irritation and desquamation of the skin is produced,
when it should be suspended until the parts will bear renewed
applications.Besides the topical application of the red iodide, this
remedy may be given internally with advantage without reference to
syphilitic infection.It seems to the writer probable that bichloride
of mercury may be as useful, as it is certainly more manageable.The
chloride of gold and sodium, arsenic in small doses, and the metallic
tonics, so called, may be useful carefully administered, especially the
first mentioned, which the writer believes has some real power over the
disease.As the hepatic functions are
much disturbed, if not entirely suspended, it is necessary to give
those foods which are converted into peptones in the stomach.As a
rule, fats, starches, and sweets are mischievous, and milk, meats,
oysters, and the nitrogenous foods best adapted to nourish the patient.If the diarrhoea should prove exhausting, the mineral acids, with
opium, are the best remedies.Nausea and vomiting are best relieved by
carbolic acid mixture, and hemorrhages by the solution of the chloride
or subsulphate of iron.Fatty Liver; Fatty Degeneration of the Liver (Hepar Adiposum).DEFINITION.--By the term fatty liver is meant a change in the organ
characterized by the excessive quantity of fat- or oil-globules
contained in the cells of the parenchyma.CAUSES.--The liver acts, under normal conditions, as a reservoir for
the surplus fat, which it gives out as the demand is made.It is not
only the fat brought to the liver by the blood which accumulates in the
organ, but it apparently possesses the power to transform certain
substances--albumen, for example--into fat.An important causative
element, therefore, is the quantity of fat present in the food
habitually consumed.This has been proved by the investigations of
Radziejewsky[148] and others, who have shown that the fat in the food
is stored up in the normal places of deposit, one of which, of course,
is the liver.Another causative element is the formation of fat from
the albumen of the hepatic cells in consequence of diminished
oxidation.In respect to both causes the consumption of oxygen is an
important factor.The insufficient supply of oxygen {1047} which is a
necessary result of a sedentary life leads thus, directly, to the
accumulation of fat in the liver-cells.A constitutional predisposition
is also an important factor.There are those who under certain
conditions of daily life store up large supplies of fat, and others who
under the same conditions continue lean.Women more than men are
subject to such inherited predispositions.[Footnote 148: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.Again, fatty liver occurs in the course of certain cachexiae, notably
phthisis.In this case the obstructive pulmonary lesions interfere with
the process of oxidation, and also maintain a constant hyperaemia of
the portal system.This condition of the liver also occurs in the
cancerous cachexia, in anaemia and chlorosis of long standing, in
chronic suppurative diseases, etc.The dyscrasia of chronic alcoholism
is a very common cause of fatty liver.At the same time that
hyperplasia of the connective tissue is taking place the fat is
accumulating in the hepatic cells.So great is the accumulation of fat
in the blood that the serum presents a milky appearance.This excess in
the quantity of fat is rather due to diminished oxidation, to lessened
combustion, than to increased production.Another causative element of
the fat-production in cases of alcoholism is the interference of
alcohol with the process of digestion and assimilation.Poisoning by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other metals sets up an
acute fatty degeneration of the liver.Pregnancy, lactation, and
suppuration also have the same effect, but to a slighter and less
permanent extent.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Fatty liver agrees with amyloid liver in that
the fatty deposits increase the size and weight of the organ.The
surface is smooth, the peritoneal investment unaltered, and the margins
rounded.Sometimes the organ is merely increased in thickness,
sometimes in diameter.It has a greasy feel and cuts like a mass of
fatty tissue.Examined at a low temperature--below freezing--it seems
like a mass of suet, the proper structure being almost extinguished in
the fatty metamorphosis.The outline of the lobules remains distinct
even in cases far advanced in the fatty degeneration, but in the
extreme cases it is obliterated, the cut surface presenting a uniformly
yellowish or grayish-yellow tint.The fatty liver is also wanting in
blood; it is dry, and on section only the largest vessels contain any
blood.When cardiac disease of a kind to produce congestion of the
venous system exists--for example, mitral or tricuspid lesions--the
same relative decrease in the quantity of blood in the liver is
observable after death, although during the life of the subject the
opposite condition may have been present.The cause of this
bloodlessness of the fatty liver is to be sought in the pressure
exerted by the growing fat-cells.Not all cases of fatty liver are advanced to the degree indicated in
the above description.From the normal size up to the maximum attained
by the most advanced fatty liver there are numerous gradations in the
quantity of fat and in the dimensions of the organ.Fatty degeneration
may accompany cirrhosis, in which the liver is contracted.The deposits
of fat may take place in particular areas.In cases of fatty liver per
se the deposit occurs within the liver-cells, as may be demonstrated on
microscopic examination, the initial change consisting in the formation
of granules in the protoplasm which ultimately coalesce, thus producing
{1048} fat-globules or cells.The fatty change in the hepatic cells
proceeds in a certain methodical manner from the cells at the periphery
of each lobule to the centre.The quantity of fat deposited in the
liver in cases of fatty change is very great.In the normal condition
of the organ fat exists, according to Perls,[149] in the proportion of
3 per cent.When the condition of fatty
liver exists the quantity of fat rises to 40, even 45, per
cent.--almost one-half.It is important to note, as was pointed out by
Frerichs, that in an inverse ratio with the increase of fat was the
quantity of water.[Footnote 149: _Virchow's Archiv_, _supra_.]That more or less fatty change in the liver is not incompatible with a
normal functional activity is quite certain, but the boundary between
health and disease is by no means well defined in respect to the
quantity of fatty change in the liver-cells.The liver, within certain
limits, is a mere reservoir of the surplus fat of the body, and hence a
variable, but not excessive, amount of accumulation of fat is not
incompatible with a normal functional performance of the organ.The
limits of a merely functional state and of a diseased state are not,
therefore, very clearly defined.In certain inferior animals, as
Frerichs has shown, a fatty condition of the liver is normal.SYMPTOMS.--The signs and symptoms of fatty liver are by no means well
defined.This state of the organ, as a rule, accompanies the general
tendency to fatty metamorphosis and deposit in the body.It is a
symptom in the course of phthisis, of chronic alcoholism, and of
various forms of metallic poisoning, but under these circumstances
there is no material change in the course of the symptoms produced by
this complication.As an independent affection it rarely, if ever,
exists alone.So far as its symptoms can be defined, they are referable
to the organs of digestion and assimilation and to the liver itself.The appetite is generally good, but distress after eating, acidity and
heartburn, eructations of acid liquid and of certain articles of diet,
are experienced.The stools are usually rather soft or liquid, wanting
in color, whitish or pasty, and occasionally dark, almost black, owing
to the presence of blood.The
discharges are often offensive from the decomposition of certain
constituents of the food, acid and burning because of the presence of
acetic, butyric, and other fat acids, or merely offensive because of
the formation of hydrogen compounds with sulphur and phosphorus.Notwithstanding the derangement of the stomachal and intestinal
digestion, the deposition of fat continues in an abnormal ratio.With
the increase in body-weight a decline in muscular power takes place.The respiration is hurried on the slightest exertion, and dyspnoea is
produced by any prolonged muscular effort.The circulation is feeble
and the pulse slow in the state of repose, but on active exertion the
pulse becomes rapid and at the same time feeble.The sleep is disturbed
by horrifying dreams, and only on assuming a nearly sitting posture can
the patient sleep with any degree of quietude.In these cases of fatty liver a very considerable mental inquietude,
despondency, even hypochondria and melancholia, result.The relation of
insufficient hepatic excretion to the mental state is yet sub judice,
but there can be no doubt that some connection exists.From the
earliest {1049} period hepatic derangements--as the term hypochondria
denotes--have been associated with certain disorders of the mind.This
relation certainly holds good in respect to the mental perturbation
occurring in cases of fatty liver.With a rotund countenance and a
well-nourished body there is associated very considerable mental
despondency.Without distinct jaundice the skin has an earthen or tallow-like hue,
the conjunctiva is muddy or distinctly yellow, and now and then
well-defined jaundice appears.The urine is rather scanty, high- because of the presence of
bile-pigments, and deposits urates abundantly.When jaundice
accompanies fatty liver the urine will be very dark, muddy, thick, and
will react to the usual tests for bile, urates, etc.The area of hepatic dulness is, as a rule, enlarged in cases of fatty
liver.The deposition of fat in the cells adds to the gross size of the
organ, and hence the inferior margin extends below the border of the
ribs to a degree determined by the amount of increase in its substance.If the liver can be felt, it is smooth, not hard and resisting, and is
free from nodules.Usually, however, owing to deposits of fat in the
omentum and in the abdominal walls, the outlines and condition of the
liver cannot be ascertained, and must remain merely conjectural.Rather, therefore, by implication than by direct examination can the
condition of the liver be ascertained.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of fatty liver, as an
element in a general change not of a toxic character, is essentially of
a chronic character.The fatty liver of acute phosphorus, antimonial,
and other forms of poisoning is acute and fatal, but it is not these
forms with which we are here concerned.Acting the part of a reservoir
of the surplus fat stored up in the body, which may be disposed of
under normal and physiological conditions, the fatty liver becomes by
careful management a normal organ again.The course, duration, and
termination will therefore largely depend on the nature of the
management pursued.A fatty liver cannot, then, be regarded as fatal,
or even as dangerous to life per se.The course and termination will
therefore be those of the associated condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the existence of fatty liver will not
be difficult in all those cases in which this condition may properly be
suspected; for example, in phthisis, in chronic alcoholismus, in
obesity, and in cases of habitual indulgence in eating and drinking.If
in these cases the organ is distinctly enlarged, is smooth, and is
flabby in outline; if at the same time the digestion is deranged, the
stools are light in color, there are hemorrhoids, flatulence, acid
indigestion, and torpid bowels,--a fatty liver may be reasonably
suspected.The subjects of fatty liver are usually obese, and present
the characteristics typical of that condition, or they are the victims
of alcoholismus or present the evidence of habitual indulgence in the
pleasures of the table.The differentiation of fatty liver from amyloid
degeneration, from cystic disease, and from other maladies causing
enlargement of the organ is made by reference to these points in the
etiological history--by a careful study of the condition of the organ
itself and of the organs associated with it in function.As the amyloid
liver is more likely to be confounded with the fatty liver, it should
be noted that the former is an outgrowth of the process of suppuration,
that the organ {1050} is hard in texture, and that amyloid change
occurs at the same time in other organs--conditions opposed to those
characteristic of the fatty liver.Cancer of the liver is accompanied
by a peculiar cachexia; the body wastes, and the enlarged liver is hard
and nodular instead of being smooth and flabby.TREATMENT.--When fatty liver is a symptom merely, its treatment is
merged into that of the primary condition.Thus, in phthisis and in the
various forms of metallic and phosphorus-poisoning the condition of the
liver is quite secondary.There are cases of obesity, however, in which
the fatty change in the liver is a part of the general morbid process,
and must be treated accordingly.There are still other cases in which,
without a decided tendency to obesity, the food habitually consumed is
of a fatty or fat-forming nature.The first requisite in the treatment
of fatty liver is to amend the diet.From the time of Hippocrates down
to Mr.Banting it has been recognized that the starchy and saccharine
constituents of the food, as well as the fatty, contribute to the
formation of fat.In arranging a dietary in cases of fatty liver this
fact should be regarded.Besides excluding the fats, saccharine and
starchy substances should be cut off.The diet should be composed of
fresh animal foods, game, fish, oysters, and such succulent vegetables
as lettuce, celery, spinach, raw cabbage (cole-slaw), etc.Amongst the
articles excluded should be bread, but the greatest difficulty is
experienced in its withdrawal, many patients declaring themselves
unable to live without it.In such instances a small biscuit
(water-cracker) may be allowed, but, as far as may be accomplished,
bread should be cut off from the diet.If there are acidity, heartburn, pyrosis, and regurgitation of acid
liquid, much good may be expected from the administration of diluted
nitric acid before meals, especially if there be considerable uric acid
in the urine.The simultaneous administration of tincture of nux vomica
will prove useful if the appetite is poor and the digestion feeble.When the complexion is muddy, the conjunctivae yellow, and the tongue
coated, excellent results are had from the persistent use of phosphate
of sodium.Even better results may be had from a combination of the two agents, a
teaspoonful of the pulverized phosphate being given with one-fortieth
of a grain of the arseniate of sodium.Alkalies, as lithium citrate,
solution of potassa, etc., are unquestionably useful as remedies for
obesity and fatty liver, but they must be administered with a proper
caution.Also, the permanganate of potassium has seemed to the author
to be especially valuable as a remedy for these states.Remedies to increase the activity of the portal circulation and
diminish congestion of the hepatic vessels are useful at the outset,
but the anaemia which succeeds renders their use improper at a later
period.Amongst the hepatic stimulants of great use in those cases
characterized by whitish, pasty stools, yellow conjunctivae, etc., are
resin of podophyllin, euonymin, baptisin, and others having the same
powers.Saline laxatives are also useful, but to a less extent.It must
be remembered, however, that these subjects are wanting in bodily
vigor, often suffer from weak heart, and always have flabby muscles, so
that they bear all depleting measures badly.The hepatic stimulant of
greatest utility in these cases is sulphate of manganese.The writer
has had excellent results from a {1051} combination of quinine and
manganese.For the general state, which denotes insufficient oxidation
according to the chemical pathologists, permanganate of potassium is a
remedy of value, as above mentioned.The best form in which to
administer this is the compressed tablet, and the dose usually is two
grains.As chalybeate tonics are indicated, the oxidizing power of the
succinate of the ferric peroxide, the remedy so warmly advocated by
Buckler, may be utilized with advantage.The combination of quinine,
iron, and manganese in pill form, or the syrup of the iodides of iron
and manganese, or the phosphate of iron, quinine, and strychnine, are
tonics adapted to the relief of the depression accompanying this
malady.AFFECTIONS OF THE BILIARY PASSAGES.Catarrh of the Bile-Ducts.HISTORY AND DEFINITION.--Although catarrh of the bile-ducts had been
incidentally referred to by some previous writers, notably by Stokes of
Dublin, Virchow[150] was the first to treat of this condition
systematically.Amongst recent writers, Harley[151] appears to be the
only one disposed to question the importance of catarrh of the
bile-ducts as a factor in the production of jaundice.Even in
phosphorus-poisoning the appearance of jaundice, at one time supposed
to be haematogenic in source, has been referred to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.[152] It seems probable that opinions have too decidedly
veered toward the importance of this condition as a factor in the
production of jaundice.[Footnote 150: _Archiv fur path.117 _et seq._]

[Footnote 151: _Diseases of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 152: Wyss, _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1867, p.CAUSES.--Catarrh of the bile-ducts has been referred to all those
causes which can excite a catarrhal process in any situation.Amongst the systemic may be placed peculiarities of
constitution or idiosyncrasy.A tendency to hepatic disorders is a
feature in certain types of constitution, and, as such types are
transmitted, the hepatic disorders seem to be inherited.In such
persons, possessing the so-called bilious nature, catarrh of the
biliary passages is not uncommon, and a special susceptibility to it
apparently exists.The atmospherical and other causes which in some
subjects will set up a catarrh of the bronchi will in the bilious type
induce a catarrh of the duodenum and bile-ducts.The malady is not
inherited; only the character of bodily structure which favors it under
the necessary conditions.Climatic changes and certain seasons, especially the autumn, are
influential causes.Exposure to cold and dampness, the body warm and
perspiring, will set up a catarrhal process in the bile-ducts and
intestine, especially in those having the special susceptibility which
belongs to certain bodily types.Malarial miasm is an especially active
cause in malarial regions.The writer has seen many examples in various
parts of the United States within the malaria-breeding zone.Other
miasmatic agencies are not without importance.The exhalations from the
{1052} freshly-upturned soil of some cities, the gases from cesspools
and sewers, and illuminating gas exert a causative influence.The bad
air thus made up has been happily called civic malaria.The most influential causes of catarrh of the biliary passages are
local in origin and in action: they are the agencies which induce
catarrh of the duodenum.Disturbances of the portal circulation should
be first named.Whenever obstructive lesions of the cardiac orifices
exist, whenever the pulmonary circulation is impeded by disease of the
lungs, the portal vein is kept abnormally full, and as a necessary
result of the stasis a catarrh of the mucous membrane follows.Congestion of the portal system may be a result of vaso-motor paresis.The abdominal sympathetic may be the seat of various reflex
disturbances: those of a depressing kind induce stasis in the portal
system.Certain medicinal agents have this effect, and prolonged and
severe cutaneous irritation, it is probable, may act on the portal
circulation in the same way.The action of cold on the peripheral
nerves may be similarly explained.Catarrh by contiguity of tissue is the most frequent factor.Catarrh of
the duodenal mucous membrane is the initial condition, and from thence
the process extends to the bile-ducts.Although the duodenum may be
alone affected, the usual state of things is a gastro-intestinal
catarrh, the stomach and the whole length of the small intestine being
simultaneously diseased.When the catarrhal process is thus diffused
the duodenal mucous membrane is most deranged, probably because the
acid and fermenting chyme is first received here, and what acridity
soever it may possess attacks this part in its greatest strength.It
must be remembered that the secretion of the duodenal glands and of the
pancreas and liver must also have an abnormal character; hence those
foods which in the healthy condition of things are digested in this
part of the canal undergo ordinary putrefactive decomposition and
furnish very irritating products.This observation is especially true
of the fats: the fat acids are in the highest degree irritating.The
digestive fluid of the duodenum has a more or less pathological
character, because the catarrhal process not only interferes with the
habitually easy flow of the gland secretions, but, extending to the
gland elements themselves, gradually alter their structure.Gastro-intestinal catarrh results from the misuse of foods and the
abuse of certain condiments and of spirits.Excess in the quantity of
starchy, saccharine, and fatty foods which undergo conversion and
absorption in the intestine, habitually consumed, decomposition of such
portions as escape proper digestion ensues, and the products of this
decomposition exercise an irritant influence on the mucous membrane.The daily consumption of sauces and condiments and of highly-seasoned
foods has a constant irritating action; but more influential than any
other causative agency is the abuse of malt liquors and spirit.Whilst
the latter acts more on the stomach and the liver proper, the former
affect more the duodenal mucous membrane and the bile-ducts.To these causative agencies must be added a pathological state of the
bile itself.Under conditions not now known the bile seems to acquire
acrid properties and set up a catarrh in passing along the ducts.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The area affected by the catarrhal process
varies greatly.The termination of the common duct for a short space
may be the only part affected, but with this there is always more or
less, {1053} sometimes most extensive and severe, duodenal catarrh,
followed by jaundice.The extent to which the common duct is affected
may be exactly indicated by the staining with bile, which extends down
to the point of obstruction.The catarrhal process may invade the whole
extent of the common duct, the cystic duct, gall-bladder, and the
ramifications of the tube throughout the organ.The first change observable is a more or less considerable hyperaemia
of the mucous membrane; but this is rarely seen, because the
examination cannot be made at the time when this condition is present.The epithelial layer is swollen, sodden, the cells cloudy, undergoing
rapid multiplication and desquamating.The cast-off cylindrical
epithelium, mucous cells, and serum make up a turbid mixture, which,
with bile, fills the smaller ducts, and may in places, especially at
the orifice of the common duct, form an obstruction sufficient to
prevent the passage of the bile; which may, however, be readily pressed
out with a little force.Especially near the end of the common duct the
mucus is apt to accumulate, and a plug of it, often tenacious and
somewhat consistent, obstructs the orifice.It is probable that whilst
catarrh is the chief cause of jaundice, it may also, by a merely
intermittent activity, cause the condition of biliousness--now so far
relieved as to permit the bile to descend into the intestine, now so
much obstruction as to prevent the escape of any considerable part of
that formed.When the common duct is the seat of the catarrhal process,
and the outflow of bile thus prevented, it accumulates in the
gall-bladder, which may be so far distended as to present a
recognizable tumor of pyriform shape through the abdominal parietes.When the catarrhal process invades the finer ducts the appearances are
somewhat different.There are no bile-stains along the course of the
common and cystic ducts, and the gall-bladder is empty, or at most
contains only some mucus, with altered bile.The tubes at or near their
ultimate ramifications contain a turbid mucus composed of cylindrical
epithelium and lymphoid cells, and tenacious enough to close them
firmly.More or less hyperaemia of the liver-structures proper, and
consequent increased dimensions of the organ, a more or less active
catarrhal condition of the duodenal mucous membrane, accompany the
changes in the finer ducts.SYMPTOMS.--There are marked differences in the behavior of the more
acute cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts and the chronic examples of
the same disorder.The former is held to be the most frequent cause of
jaundice, whilst the latter is an important element in the so-called
bilious state, in lithaemia, and as a secondary condition in some
cardiac and pulmonary diseases.Also, the morbid complexus of catarrh
of the bile-ducts includes the symptoms of duodenal and gastro-duodenal
catarrh.The acute form of this disease sets in with the symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh.Usually, after indulgence in too highly
stimulating food or in some article having a specially irritating
character, an attack of acute indigestion supervenes.The tongue is
more or less heavily coated, the breath heavy, the taste bitter, pasty,
or sourish, the appetite poor or actual repugnance to food, especially
to the offending articles, is experienced, and nausea, not unfrequently
vomiting, ensues.The epigastrium and the hypochondriac regions have a
heavy, overloaded, distressed, {1054} and sore feeling; there is some
tenderness to pressure; sometimes the gall-bladder, abnormally full,
may be detected by careful palpation; and the area of hepatic dulness
will usually be increased.The abdomen is more or less distended by
gases, and eructations of offensive gases (hydrogen and sulphur
compounds, volatile fat acids, etc.)Constipation exists when
the catarrhal process is limited to the duodenum, and the stools
consist of hard lumps having a light yellow, clay-, or whitish
appearance.When the whole extent of the small intestine is affected,
the stools will be soft, liquid, or watery, and will vary in color from
yellow to gray or white.In some cases the fecal matters will have an
offensive odor--the odor of decomposition--and considerable discharges
of very foul-smelling gas will attend the evacuations.This symptom
will occur when the intestinal digestion is suspended and the contents
of the bowel in consequence undergo putrefactive decomposition.During the initial period of the disorder the urine will simply be
high- and loaded with urates and uric acid, but when jaundice
supervenes the pigment will convert the urine into a dark,
coffee-, and somewhat thick liquid.With the onset of the malady symptoms referable to the nervous system
appear.Headache, dizziness, and hebetude of mind are present, and now
and then an attack of catarrh of the bile-ducts will have the objective
signs of an ordinary migraine or sick headache.Usually, however, as
the intestinal and hepatic troubles develop, headache and some mental
hebetude come on, but when jaundice supervenes the headache becomes
more severe, and very considerable mental depression, irritability of
temper, and moroseness are experienced.Chilly sensations, with flashes
of heat, are felt at the outset, but with the appearance of jaundice
the sensation of coldness predominates.In some cases, the intestinal
catarrh being extensive, there will be, after some preliminary
chilliness, a febrile movement, but this is never of a pronounced
character, and in the slighter cases of the disease or when the
catarrhal process is limited to the bile-ducts, there is no elevation
of temperature.With the first symptoms the pulse is somewhat
quickened, but as the bile acids accumulate in the blood they effect a
decided slowing of the heart's action, the pulse falling as low, it may
be, as 50 per minute.This lessened activity of the circulation is
accompanied by corresponding reduction of temperature, the body-heat
falling a degree or more.The most distinctive symptom of catarrh of the bile-ducts is jaundice.In the acute or quickly-developing form above described of catarrhal
icterus the symptoms of gastro-intestinal disturbance precede the first
indication of jaundice from five to eight days.Yellowness of the
conjunctiva and of those parts of the body exposed to the air is the
first manifestation; afterward the jaundice hue becomes general.The
tint varies in depth from a faint gamboge-yellow, only discernible in a
favorable light, to a deep greenish- or brownish-yellow.In the more chronic cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts the symptoms are
simply those of a gastro-duodenal catarrh, to which some hepatic
disturbances are superadded.Some abdominal uneasiness felt in the
epigastrium and in the right hypochondrium, especially in two to three
hours after meals; flatulence, sometimes accompanied by colic; {1055}
constipation, persistent or alternating with diarrhoea--in the one case
in hard lumps with more or less mucus adherent, in the other soft or
liquid, and in both cases having a rather golden-yellow color, grayish
or black and tar-like appearance,--such are the symptoms referable to
the intestinal canal.The disturbances in the hepatic functions
produced by the catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane of the ducts
are further exhibited in a somewhat sallow, earthy, or muddy
complexion, yellowish tint of the conjunctiva, high-, acid urine
loaded with urates and phosphates.Such subjects, although having, it
may be, a keen appetite, rather lose than gain in weight: they
experience lassitude, headache, much depression of spirits, and the
mental symptoms are most pronounced during the time intestinal
digestion is going on.In fact, the morbid complexus is rather that of
intestinal catarrh; nevertheless, the slight degree of obstruction to
the outflow of bile occurring in these cases has an influence both in
the intestinal digestion and in the nutritive functions.Any degree of
obstruction, as has already been pointed out, leads to serious
structural change of the liver, and this in turn produces well-defined
symptoms.Disturbances of the hepatic functions, even jaundice, accompany the
paroxysms of malarial fever.Without the occurrence of fever, catarrhal
jaundice may come on during the course of chronic malarial poisoning.Catarrh of the bile-ducts is the pathogenetic factor in these cases.More especially in malarial regions, but also in temperate and warm
climates, paroxysmal attacks, with or without jaundice, are
comparatively frequent.These acute seizures occur in those having the
chronic form of the malady, and are excited by sudden climatic changes,
by excesses in eating, especially by the use of improper articles of
diet.Considerable nausea, flatulence, and constipation or diarrhoea,
weight, tension, and soreness in the right hypochondrium and sometimes
in the shoulder, chilliness, general malaise, headache, and an
increasing icterode tint of the skin, constitute the complexus of
symptoms belonging to these cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Acute catarrh of the bile-ducts
with jaundice has a well-defined course--in its mildest form, with
little gastric or gastro-intestinal disturbance--lasting ten days or
two weeks; in the ordinary form, with the accompanying gastro-duodenal
catarrh, running its course in a month to six weeks.In the chronic
form, with acute exacerbations due to indiscretions in diet or to
climatic influences, the course of the disease is chequered by
vicissitudes, the result of the causes just mentioned, and its duration
must therefore be indefinite and, as a rule, protracted.Catarrh of the
bile-ducts, or catarrhal jaundice, usually terminates in health after a
period of functional derangement of the intestines and liver.Without
exhibiting any features of a special character, some cases do not pass
through this benign course: the intestinal catarrh sets up an
ulcerative process at one or more points in the duodenum; but more
especially the obstruction to the free course of the bile caused by the
catarrhal swelling of the mucous lining of the ducts induces structural
changes in the liver--an hypertrophy of the connective-tissue elements,
a sclerosis.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.DIAGNOSIS.--There are but two signs which indicate the nature of the
disorder, and only one that is really distinctive.Intestinal
indigestion with slight coincident biliary derangement is one, and
jaundice is the {1056} other.When, after the signs and symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh have declared themselves, jaundice appears,
there can be no question as to the nature of the case.The diagnosis is
more difficult in the chronic cases with exacerbations due to the
exciting causes above mentioned, for the persistence of the jaundice
will suggest the occurrence of some permanent organic lesion.The
differentiation of the various kinds of jaundice has already been made.TREATMENT.--Regulation of the diet is of the first importance.Those
foods requiring the intestinal juices for their solution and
absorption, and which cannot be properly digested when a duodenal
catarrh exists or when bile is absent, should of course be excluded
from the diet.These articles are the fats, starches, and sweets.The
mucus playing the part of a ferment, these substances are converted
into various secondary products of an irritating character.Flatulence
is caused by the evolution of carbonic acid gas and the hydrogen
compounds of sulphur and phosphorus; and acetic, butyric, and other
acids not only change the reaction of the intestinal juices, but are
directly irritating to the mucous membrane.In the acute cases a diet
of skimmed milk, taken hot and at three hours' interval, and after the
acute symptoms have subsided, in conjunction with some other aliment,
is the most appropriate mode of alimentation.Meats, fish, eggs, and
oysters are the chief articles of diet, besides the milk, during the
whole course of the more chronic cases; and to these may be added the
succulent vegetables, as lettuce, spinach, celery, raw cabbage, and
tomatoes.If, in consequence of irritability of the mucous membrane or
of idiosyncrasy, any article occasions distress, it should be omitted
from the diet.The medicinal management includes the administration of remedies for
gastro-intestinal catarrh.The treatment of catarrhal jaundice has been
discussed.When constipation exists, saline laxatives, especially
phosphate of sodium and Rochelle salt, are useful.If there be
diarrhoea, the most appropriate remedies are bismuth, with or without
carbolic acid, Hope's mixture, oxides of zinc and silver, and other
mineral tonic astringents.The propriety of the administration of special hepatic
stimulants--cholagogues--has been much disputed.When the disorder
consists merely in an obstruction to the outflow of bile, the utility
of stimulating the production of this secretion seems more than
doubtful.Much harm has been done by the indiscriminate use of mercury.Its power to increase the production of bile having been assumed, and
the quantity of bile present in the feces being manifestly less in
cases of catarrhal jaundice, it followed that mercury should be
employed in this disorder.Modern experience has quite demonstrated its
inutility in the mode and for the purpose to which it was formerly
devoted.Nevertheless, good effects are had from calomel in small doses
as a sedative to the mucous membrane.When there are nausea, headache,
vertigo, and constipation present, excellent results may be had from
the 1/20 gr.of calomel, exhibited at short intervals until
the bowels are moved.If calomel possessed the property formerly
ascribed to it, of stimulating the hepatic functions, it would be
contraindicated in catarrh of the bile-ducts.This contraindication
exists in respect to all hepatic stimulants.If there be decided irritability of the stomach and constipation,
{1057} Seidlitz powders may be given at regular intervals.Phosphate of
sodium in drachm doses is highly useful for the double purpose of a
laxative effect and to prevent the tendency to inspissation of the
bile, which is one of the most important results of catarrh of the
bile-ducts and gall-bladder.In the more chronic cases the persistent
use of sodium phosphate is to be highly commended.In this disease, especially as it occurs in gouty subjects, sulphate of
manganese is often decidedly serviceable.If anaemia and debility
coexist, this remedy can be combined with sulphate of iron and sulphate
of quinine--a combination which the writer has found peculiarly
effective under such circumstances.When oxidation is deficient and the
urates are present in the urine in excessive quantity, good effects are
had from the permanganate of potassium, a tablet containing two grains
being given four times a day.In the more chronic cases the salts of
silver, copper, and zinc are really very useful, especially the oxides
of silver and zinc; and of these the former is more efficient.Better
than any of those mentioned is arsenic, as arseniate of sodium or as
Fowler's solution, but the best results are had from small or medium
doses persistently used.If there be much intestinal catarrh and
consequent diarrhoea, bismuth and aromatic powder, oxide of silver,
Fowler's solution with a little opium, Hope's mixture, etc.It is in catarrh of the bile-ducts that nitric and nitro-muriatic acids
have proved useful, rather than in cirrhosis and other diseases of the
liver-tissues.They prevent fermentation, promote oxidation, and
increase the activity of the assimilative functions.When there occurs
active fermentation of certain foods, and consequently considerable
flatulence, excellent results are obtained from the members of the
antiseptic group--from creasote or carbolic acid, salicylic acid,
biborate of sodium, the benzoates, etc.To these may be added quinine,
the dose of which will be determined by the purpose for which it is
prescribed.So often is catarrhal jaundice of malarial origin that
quinine becomes a remedy of high importance in the cases occurring in
the malarial-forming zone.Certain special plans of treatment have been proposed for the cure of
catarrhal jaundice.One of the most effective of these is enemata of
cold water.By means of an irrigating apparatus the large intestine is
well distended with water once a day for several days.The first enema
has a temperature of 60 degrees F., and subsequent injections are a
little warmer.The increased peristalsis of the bowels and the reflex
contractions of the gall-bladder dislodge the mucus lining and
obstructing the gall-ducts.When the bile flows into the intestine,
digestion is resumed and the catarrhal inflammation subsides.But with
the irrigation method may be employed other remedies, as above
indicated.Faradization of the gall-bladder has been used successfully for the
expulsion of the stored-up bile and the removal of the mucus
obstructing the ducts.It is applied by means of one moistened sponge
electrode placed directly over the gall-bladder, and the other on the
opposite side of the body and posteriorly.A slowly-interrupted faradic
current is then passed.This expedient is not suitable when the case is
acute in character.{1058} Biliary Concretions; Gall-Stones; Hepatic Calculi; Hepatic
Colic.DEFINITION.--There are two classes of concretions which may occasion
symptoms: inspissated bile and regularly-formed gall-stones.Slowly-developing symptoms of jaundice from obstruction may arise from
the deposit of particles of inspissated bile in the hepatic ducts, or
sudden attacks of hepatic colic be due to the passage of concretions.When biliary calculi reach the intestines, certain kinds of disturbance
may be caused by their presence there.Under the term biliary
concretions must be considered, therefore, the mechanism of their
production, their composition, the symptoms caused by their passage
through the ducts (hepatic colic), and the intestinal disturbance due
to their retention in the bowel.Formation: Inspissated Bile.--Those concretions consisting of
inspissated bile are irregularly-shaped masses of a brownish,
greenish-brown, or reddish-brown color, friable and crumbling into a
gritty dust with slight pressure of the fingers.When recent and before
drying, they are softer, almost pultaceous, and may take the form of
the canal through which pressed.But as seen after drying they present
the appearance of a dark vegetable extract, dried and partly
pulverized.When examined as found in the gall-bladder or lodged in the
larger hepatic ducts or distributed in irregular fragments (gall-sand)
in the various hepatic passages, they present the shape, color, and
general characteristics of a partly-dried vegetable extract roughly
broken up, but still soft enough to take any shape from pressure.The
writer has seen them thus in situ accompanying regularly-formed
gall-stones in a case of gunshot wound of the liver.These masses of
inspissated bile differ from gall-stones in composition; they consist
of bile, but with a preponderance of the coloring matter.According to
Harley,[153] who has given a more correct account of these bodies than
any other systematic writer, their composition is as follows:

  Water    5.4
  Solids  94.6

The contents of the solids are--

  Bile-pigment                84.2
  Cholesterin                  0.6
  Salts (iron, potash, soda)  15.2

[Footnote 153: _The Diseases of the Liver, with and without Jaundice,
etc._, by George Harley, M.D., F.R.S., Philada., 1883, p.Some years ago, before I was aware of the nature of such concretions.I
detected a number in examining the stools of a patient who had in quick
succession many attacks of hepatic colic, but as the usual form of
concretion was looked for and not found, the relation of these bodies
to the symptoms in the case was not understood.I now recognize the
value of Harley's observations on these bodies.The biliary concretion which is properly a gall-stone has a definite
form and a more or less well-defined crystalline structure.The most usual form is octagonal or hexagonal or
polyangular, with smooth facets, corresponding to points of contact of
other calculi.Instead of smooth facets and sharp angles, the
concretion may be studded with irregularly-shaped masses.When there
are numerous {1059} calculi present, they have smooth surfaces and
rather sharp angles, made, not by attrition, as has been supposed, but
by deposition of the new material under pressure.When they have this
form there are many present, but the number of facets does not indicate
the number of calculi, and the absence of facets is not proof of the
absence of other calculi.The smooth opposing surfaces are not always
plane, but may be convex or concave to fit the shape of the adjacent
bodies.Calculi may be globular, ovoid, cylindrical, and truncated cones.The
largest in my collection is egg-shaped, and nearly filled the
gall-bladder which contained it, a little mucus free from bile-elements
only being present.If a concretion forms in a duct or a single one is
present in the gall-bladder, the shape is determined by the pressure of
the walls of the duct or of the gall-bladder, respectively.As found in
the stools, and still somewhat soft, the shape will represent the form
of the common duct through which it has been pressed.Such a soft,
recently-formed gall-stone will have the crystalline structure and
chemical constitution of these bodies, and will therefore differ from,
apparently, similar masses of inspissated bile.Although a round,
ovoid, or cylindrical calculus indicates the absence of others because
there are no evidences of mutual pressure and adaptation, a positive
conclusion cannot be reached in that way, for the gall-bladder may
contain numerous calculi of long-standing, and a recent concretion
formed in a duct be discharged with the usual symptoms.The number of calculi which may be present at any time or be produced
in the course of years ranges from one to several thousand.The number
is in inverse ratio to the size.One case[154] is reported in which
7802 calculi were found in the gall-bladder, but they must have been
very minute in size.Of the specimens now in my collection, there are
230 obtained from one gall-bladder, which they entirely filled; they
are nearly uniform in size, have an average weight of two grains, and
contain four, five, and six smooth facets.Another collection of
calculi removed from a closed gall-bladder contains 45, of large size,
distending the organ and forming a tumor which projected beyond the
margin of the liver.Hepatic calculi are rarely solitary; hence if one
attack of hepatic colic occur, others may be expected.[Footnote 154: Frerichs, _op.In color gall-stones vary from a clear white to a dark-brown, almost
black, tint.The most usual tint of the mature calculi in the
gall-bladder is that of the ripe chestnut.Long stay in the intestines
increases the depth of the color, until it becomes almost black; on the
other hand, detention in the gall-bladder has a slightly bleaching
action; but the real cause of difference of color is the presence or
absence of pigment.If composed of pure cholesterin, the color will be
whitish, opaque, or glistening and almost translucent.In size gall-stones vary from the smallest pea up to a hen's egg.When
several hundreds are contained in the gall-bladder, they will usually
be of the dimension of a medium-sized pea.Two large solitary
concretions in my possession are respectively 2 inches and 1-1/2 inches
in long diameter, and 1 inch and 3/4 of an inch transversely.Very much
larger calculi have, however, been recorded; thus, one mentioned by
Frerichs is 5 inches in length and 4 inches in circumference.The most
frequently {1060} encountered calculus, at least in this country, is
polyangular in shape and of the size of a large pea.Globular or ovoid
seems to be the prevailing form, and the dimensions that of a small
pea, in Germany, according to Frerichs and Von Schuppel, but this
statement must refer to the initial shape of these bodies.Not all hepatic calculi have defined mathematical forms, but may
consist of branching cylinders composed of irregular nodular masses,
not unlike the concretions of inspissated bile.As a rule, in each case
where the calculi are multiple there is uniformity of color, shape, and
composition.The
calculi obtained from each subject are in one case white, polyangular,
rather unctuous, and nearly equal in size; in another, chestnut-brown
in color, polyangular in shape, and varying slightly in size, but
uniformly characteristic in shape; and in a third, singular in number,
ovoid in shape, dark-brown in color.When fresh they contain
considerable water, and at all times are hygroscopic.Dried in the air,
they are composed of--

  Water    4
  Solids  96
         ---
         100

The solids consist of--

  Cholesterin                  98
  Pigment                       1
  Inorganic or mineral matter   1
                              ---
                              100

Such are the constituents, according to Harley, of the usual
concretion, the cholesterin calculus.But as other varieties are
encountered occasionally, it may be well to give the composition of
these.The following table by Ritter, to be found in _Robin's Journal_
for 1872 (p.60), is a correct representation of the contents of
different specimens:

---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----

The above may be regarded as the average composition, expressed in
round numbers.The variations from these figures will be comprehended
in two parts.A calculus consists of three several parts: the nucleus, the body, the
rind.A calculus of small or medium size may be a nucleus for the
formation of a large one.Usually the nucleus consists of a bit of
mucus, casts of the biliary ducts (Thudicum), inspissated bile, a
blood-clot, a liver-fluke or other parasite, as a desiccated
round-worm, or some foreign body, as a seed, or, as in one reported
example, a globule of mercury.[155] {1061} The central mass of mucus
may contain a large proportion of pigment or crystals of cholesterin or
lime-salts, giving it special characteristics.[156] There may be
several nuclei.Fauconneau-Dufresne reports an instance in which a
pyramidal concretion contained four, and Guilbert a globular stone with
five, distinct nuclei.Such examples of calculi having multiple nuclei
are produced by the adhesion whilst in a soft state of two or more, and
the subsequent addition of material to the conjoint mass, welding it
into a single stone.A few calculi are homogeneous throughout, composed
of nearly pure cholesterin, mixed intimately with a little coloring
matter and lime salts.The cholesterin calculus will have a somewhat
translucent appearance, will be a dead white or a yellowish-white, or
present a greenish- or brownish-yellow tint through the white.Even the
white calculus, apparently composed of nearly pure cholesterin, will be
found on section to contain traces of a nucleus.By long detention in a
gall-bladder whose duct is permanently occluded, and is therefore free
of fluid, the mucus nucleus may so shrivel as to leave a cavity which
is merely stained.One of my specimens--a solitary calculus of large
size--exhibits this peculiarity.[Footnote 155: Thudicum, J. L., _On Gall-stones_, London, 1863; also
Frerichs, _op.[Footnote 156: Cyr, Jules, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_,
Paris, 1884, p.11 _et seq._]

The body consists of cholesterin, nacreous or darkened by pigment,
deposited in radiating lines or in concentric layers, or in both
together.Pigment may be intimately incorporated with the cholesterin
or deposited between the layers of this substance, pure or nearly pure,
forming an alternating arrangement.The crust or rind usually is smooth, unctuous to the touch, firm, but
when broken with the finger-nail readily crumbles.When composed of
lime salts, or when the cholesterin is mixed with varying proportions
of these salts and of pigment, the surface is still smooth, but
thicker, firmer, and darker in color.The rind may not be smooth, but
studded with wart-like projections, or it may consist of several layers
of earthy matter separated by pigment.These layers may be very
friable, and readily crumble and fall off.In some instances the crust,
several lines in thickness, is the body of the calculus, and the cavity
contains only a light honeycomb of mucus and pigment.The specific gravity of gall-stones composed of crystallized
cholesterin is nearly that of water.Air-dried calculi will float on
water, but the recent ones, full of moisture, sink.The relation of the
weight of the calculus to that of the bile is more important.As the
specific gravity of bile ranges from 1020 to 1026, it is obvious that
on this fluid air-dried calculi will float, but, holding in the recent
state much water, ordinary gall-stones will sink.Those containing much
mineral matter will have a correspondingly high specific gravity--much
higher than bile.ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF HEPATIC CALCULI.--Certain conditions are
necessary to the formation of these bodies on the part of the bile and
on the part of the gall-bladder and ducts.Constituted for the most
part of cholesterin, which exists in such small quantity in normal
bile, there must be some change in the composition of this fluid to
increase the quantity or to diminish the solubility of that
constituent.It will conduce to a better understanding of the subject
to premise the composition of the bile: {1062}

  Bile contains, in 1000 parts,
    Water            860
    Solids           140

  The solids of bile are,
    Glycocholate and Taurocholate of soda  90.8
    Fat                                     9.2
    Cholesterin                             2.6
    Mucus                                   1.4
    Pigment and extractive                 28.Salts                                   8.-----
                                          140.Normal bile is neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction.If the
reaction become acid from any cause, the constituent cholesterin is
precipitated; and this occurs the more readily the larger the
proportion of this substance held in solution.Cholesterin is an
excrementitious material found in the blood and excreted by the liver.It represents in part, probably, the waste of nervous matter, but more
certainly of the fatty tissues in general.Conditions of the system in
which the metamorphosis of the fatty elements occurs more freely--as
obesity, advancing life, etc.--are accompanied by an increased
production and excretion of cholesterin.So long as the neutral state or the alkalinity of the bile is
maintained, the cholesterin will be kept in solution, although its
relative proportion may be in excess of the normal.A lack of the soda
constituent of the system is one factor, but the most important is a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane of the bile-ducts and
gall-bladder.The mucus formed plays a double role: it furnishes a
nucleus about which cholesterin crystallizes; it acts as a ferment and
inaugurates a process of acid fermentation which results in the
precipitation of cholesterin.When all the conditions favorable to the
separation and crystallization of cholesterin are present, any foreign
body may serve the purpose of a nucleus.The articles which have thus
served have been enumerated.A by no means infrequent combination is that of bilirubin with calcium;
and this may constitute the nucleus or form a part of the body or the
crust of a calculus.The mechanism of its formation is not unlike that
of the cholesterin concretion.Bilirubin is soluble in alkalies, and is
precipitated from its solution by acids.It follows that when acid
fermentation takes places under the influence of mucus, bilirubin may
be precipitated in combination with calcium.The salts of sodium and
potassium are much more abundant in bile than those of lime, but the
latter much more often enter into the formation of calculi because of
their slighter solubility.Other combinations of bile-pigments, mucus,
and the salts of the bile take place, but they are relatively less
frequent.The principal lime salt is the carbonate, and this combines
in varying proportions with the bile acids, the fat acids, and
bile-pigment.Certain physical conditions are not less important than the chemical in
the production of hepatic calculi.Accumulation of bile in the
gall-bladder, stasis, and concentration are essential conditions.If
bile remains long in the gall-bladder, it becomes darker in color and
more viscid, its specific gravity rises, and the relative proportion of
solids increases, doubtless because of the absorption of a part of the
water.The reaction--which, as has been stated, is in the fresh state
neutral or {1063} alkaline--becomes acid in consequence of a
fermentative change (Von Gorup-Besanez) set up by the mucus.If a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane exist, the mucus, epithelium,
and lymphoid cells cast off play the part of a ferment.The lime which
is so important a constituent of biliary concretions is not present
even in concentrated bile in sufficient amount to account for its
agency in the formation of these bodies, is furnished by the diseased
mucous membrane (Frerichs).Indeed, numerous crystals of carbonate of
lime have been seen in situ in contact with the mucous membrane in
cases of chronic catarrh.It follows, then, that catarrh of the biliary
passages has an important causative relation to that pathological
condition of the bile which precedes the formation of calculi.In this
connection we must not lose sight of the researches made by Ord[157] on
the action exerted by colloids on the formation of concretions.The
mucus is the colloid; cholesterin, lime, and soda salts are the
crystalloids.These latter diffusing through the colloid medium, the
resulting combinations assume spheroidal forms.The union of bilirubin
and lime salts illustrates the same principle.[Footnote 157: _On the Influence of Colloids upon Crystalline Forms and
Cohesion, with Observations on the Structure and Mode of Formation of
Urinary and other Calculi_, by W. Miller Ord, M.D., F.R.C.P.Lond.,
etc., London, 1879.]CAUSES.--We have here to consider the external conditions and the
general somatic influences which lead to the formation of biliary
concretions.Besides other
agencies due to advancing life, the increase of cholesterin is an
influential factor.The less active state of the functions in general,
diminished oxidation, loss of water, and concentration of the bile are
influential factors in determining the formation of hepatic calculi in
advancing life, as the opposite conditions oppose their production in
early life.Although not unknown in infancy, at this period in life and
until twenty years of age they occur but rarely.Fauconneau-Dufresne,[158] of 91 cases, had 4 in infants; Wolff[159] had
1 in a collection of 45 cases; and Cyr,[160] 2 cases under ten in a
group of 558 cases.The following table illustrates the influence of
age on the productivity of gall-stones:

p.[Footnote 160: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, Paris, 1884,
p.Although there is a general correspondence in the results of the
observations on the age most liable, there are differences.Thus, Cyr,
whose figures represent the experiences at Vichy, makes the age of
maximum liability from twenty to forty years--distinctly earlier than
any other observer; and hence it is necessary to bear in mind the
extreme latitude of his diagnosis.Of my own collection, 30 in number,
all doubtful cases {1064} excluded, there were 20 between thirty and
fifty years, and 10 between fifty and seventy.Of these, 22 occurred in
subjects between forty and sixty.The period of maximum liability is
about fifty years of age.Cyr refers the difference of his statistics
from those of other observers to the character of the patients.The
preponderance in the number of cases of hepatic calculi at or about the
fiftieth year is referable to the lessened activity of the nutritive
functions at this period, and to the increase in the relative
proportion of cholesterin in the blood in advanced life (Luton[161]).Charcot[162] maintains that after sixty biliary calculi are more
frequent, but owing to the physiological conditions then existing the
migration of these bodies is effected without notable inconvenience.[Footnote 161: Jaccoud's _Dictionnaire encycloped._, art."Voies
Biliaires;" _idem._, _Bull.de Therap._, March 15, 1866.][Footnote 162: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.According to most authorities, females are more liable to the formation
of gall-stones than are men.Thudicum, after an analysis of the
statistics given by the most experienced and celebrated authorities,
places the proportion at 3 to 2.Von Schuppel gives the same figures.Cyr, whilst recognizing this estimate as true of the great mass of
observations on this point, finds that in his own cases the
preponderance of females over males was even greater, being 4 to
1--inversely to the liability of the sexes to gout; but this excess is
to be explained by the character of the subjects falling under his
observation.Women are subjected to influences which favor the
formation of these concretions, such as pregnancy, sedentary habits,
diet of a restricted character, the use of corsets, and the somatic
changes at the climacteric period.The social state, by reason of the conditions associated with a good
position in life, has an influence in the production of calculi.Luxurious habits and indulgence in the pleasures of the table are
important factors, and hence this malady is encountered amongst the
better class of patients in private practice rather than amongst
laboring people in the hospitals.As the somatic conditions which exert a predisposing action, and the
social circumstances also favoring the formation of hepatic calculi,
are transmitted, heredity is by some classed among the etiological
factors, but it can only be regarded as indirect.Malarial influences unquestionably exert a very powerful influence as
this malady occurs in this country.Paroxysms of intermittent either
induce or accompany the seizures of hepatic colic, and chronic malarial
poisoning exerts a direct causative influence through the hepatic
disturbances and the gastro-duodenal catarrh which are associated with
it.Attacks of hepatic colic are extremely frequent in the malarial
regions of the West and South.It may be, however, that this malady is
frequent rather in consequence of the diet of pork than of climatic
causes, for it is probable that indulgence in such food plays an
important part in the formation of biliary concretions (Harley).Due
allowance made for diet, climate is yet, no doubt, an influential
factor.In warm, especially in malarial, regions the functions of the
liver are taxed to compensate for the increased action of the skin and
lungs; but this organ is, besides, affected by the poison of malaria,
and to the congestion caused by it is superadded a catarrhal state of
the bile-ducts and of the duodenum.A {1065} pathological condition of
the bile itself is first induced; then the fermentative changes set up
by the mucus cause the separation and crystallization of pigment and
cholesterin.Certain seasons favor the formation of biliary concretions, because
then the special influences which operate at all times are more active
and persistent.These seasons are fall, winter, and early spring, and
gall-stones are more numerous then in consequence of the activity of
the malarial poison, the character of the diet then employed, and the
lessened oxidation due to the more sedentary life.Climate is a factor
of some consequence, but not in the direction that might have been
supposed.Gall-stones are more common in temperate than in tropical
climates--a statement confirmed by the observation of the physicians of
India.They are, according to Harley, quite common in Russia, where
also they attain to extraordinary dimensions; but these circumstances
are not due to the climatic peculiarities of that country, so much as
to the diet habitually consumed, consisting so largely of fatty
substances.Of all the conditions which favor the production of gall-stones, none
are so influential as the bodily state and the associated dietetic
peculiarities.Those troubled with these concretions, as they have
occurred under my observation, have been either obese or have had a
manifest tendency in that direction.They have had a strong inclination
for the fat-forming foods, also for starchy, saccharine, and fatty
articles, such as bread and butter, potatoes, beans and peas, pork,
bacon, and fat poultry, etc.Harley thinks indulgence in bacon (p.Thudicum rejects this notion on chemical grounds,
for obesity and the free consumption of fat cannot be concerned in the
production of these bodies, because cholesterin is an alcohol.[163] The
agency of a fatty diet has been so strongly indicated in clinical
observations, and the relation of cholesterin to the fats so obvious,
that it can hardly be doubted the free consumption of fat in food
contributes directly to the formation of calculi.A catarrhal state of the duodenal mucous membrane
existing, and the bile excluded by swelling and obstruction of the
bile-ducts, fats are decomposed, and the fat acids, absorbed into the
portal blood, contribute to those chemical changes in the bile which
result in the precipitation of cholesterin.Beneke[164] traces a
connection between atheromatous degeneration of the vessels and the
formation of biliary concretions.A general increase in the amount of
fat in the body is usually coincident with the atheromatous change, and
at the same time the relative proportion of cholesterin in the bile
becomes greater.[Footnote 163: _A Treatise on Gall-stones_, p.Indulgence in the starchy and saccharine foods plays a part in the
formation of gall-stones not less, if not more, important than the
consumption of fats.A diet of such materials is highly fattening, and
if the necessary local conditions exist they readily undergo
fermentation, and thus cause or keep up a catarrh of the mucous
membrane.Too long intervals between meals, Frerichs[165] thinks, is more
influential than errors of diet in causing concretions.The bile
accumulates in the gall-bladder, and the condition of repose favors the
occurrence of those changes which induce the separation and
crystallization of cholesterin.{1066} Obstacles to outflow of every
kind have the same effect.The largest calculus in my possession was
obtained from a case of cancer of the gall-bladder which compressed,
and finally closed, the cystic duct.Sedentary habits have the same
mechanical effect, but, as already pointed out, insufficient air and
exercise act by lessening oxidation.Corpulent persons indulging in
rich food and avoiding all physical exertion, those of such habits
confined to bed by illness or injury, the literary, the well-to-do,
self-indulgent, lazy, are usual subjects of this malady.Any condition
of things which causes a considerable retardation in the outflow of
bile will have a pathogenetic importance, especially if the causes of
chemical change, the lessened quantity of taurocholic and glycocholic
acid, and an increased quantity of cholesterin, coexist.Moral causes,
as fear, anxiety, chagrin, anger, etc., have seemed to exercise a
causative influence in some instances (Cyr).[Footnote 165: _A Clinical Treatise on Disease of the Liver_, Syd.To the causes of retardation of the bile-flow mentioned above must be
added catarrh of the bile-ducts.This acts in a twofold way--as an
obstruction; a plug of mucus forming the nucleus.It has already been
shown that fermentative changes may be set up by the mucus, which plays
the part of a ferment, an acid state of the bile resulting.Situation of Gall-stones, and their Destiny.--The gall-bladder is, of
course, the chief site for these bodies, but biliary concretions and
masses of inspissated bile may be found at any point in the course of
the ducts.Single stones may be impacted at any point in the cystic,
hepatic, or common duct, or masses composed of numerous small calculi
may take the form of a duct and branches, making a branching calculus
of the shape and size of the mould in which it is cast.Such casts may
be hollow, thus permitting an outlet to the bile, or they may
completely close the tube, and a cyst form, the walls of which grow
thicker with connective-tissue deposits.Stones of very large size may
be thus enclosed, Frerichs having seen one the size of a hen's egg
formed about a plum-seed, which was the nucleus.In some rare instances
the major part of the larger tubes have been filled with inspissated
bile, through which the fluid bile could only be slowly filtered.Calculi are not often found in the hepatic duct, since they can only
lodge there in descending from the smaller tubes, and hence are too
small to become wedged in.The usual site, as has been sufficiently
explained, is the gall-bladder.At the entrance to the cystic duct and
at the terminus of the common duct in the duodenum are the points where
migrating calculi are most apt to be arrested.Spontaneous disintegration of gall-stones sometimes occurs.Cholesterin
being dissolved off of the corners and edges, the cohesion of the mass
is impaired and it falls apart in several fragments.By very slight
mechanical injury air-dried calculi will be broken up.In the
gall-bladder two factors are in operation to effect the disintegration
of the contained calculi: the movements of the body, by which the
corners and the borders are crumbled; the solvent action of the
alkaline bile on the cholesterin.When, however, these concretions are
made up of lime and pigment, their integrity can be impaired only by
the process of cleavage; no solvent action can take place.Various changes occur in the ducts or in the gall-bladder in
consequence of the presence of these concretions.Whilst a catarrhal
state of the mucous {1067} membrane of the ducts is an element of much
importance in the process by which concretions are formed, on the other
hand the presence of these bodies excites catarrh, ulceration,
perforation, and, it may be, abscess of the liver.When concretions
form or are deposited in the ducts, they cause inflammatory reaction,
the walls yield, and the neighboring hepatic structures may also be
affected by contiguity.The dilatation of the tube is usually
cylindrical, much more rarely sacciform.The neighboring connective
tissue may undergo hyperplasia and a more or less extensive sclerosis
occur.More frequently the calculus ulcerates through, and an abscess
is produced which will take the usual course of that malady.Very
rarely a calculus is found enclosed in a separate sac and surrounded by
healthy hepatic tissue (Roller).[166]

[Footnote 166: _Berliner klin.42, 1879; _ibid._, Nos.16, 17, and 19 for 1877, Fargstein.]As the gall-bladder is the usual place for the formation and storage of
gall-stones, the changes in connection with this organ are the most
important.The calculi may be so numerous or so large as to distend the
gall-bladder and cause it to project from under the inferior border of
the liver, so as to be felt by palpation of the abdominal wall.The
stones may be few in number and float in healthy bile, or they may fill
the bladder to the exclusion of fluid, the cystic duct being closed
permanently; or there may be, with one or more concretions, a fluid
composed of mucus, muco-pus, serum, and bilious matter.The mucous
membrane may be in a normal state, but this is rare; usually it is
affected by the catarrhal process, and atrophic degeneration has taken
place to a less or greater extent; the rugae are obliterated, the
muscular layer hypertrophied.When attacks of hepatic colic have
occurred, more or less inflammation of the peritoneal layer of the
gall-bladder and cystic duct is lighted up, and organized exudations
form, changing the shape and position of the organs concerned.It is
usual in old cases of hepatic colic to find the gall-bladder bound down
by strong adhesions, the cavity much contracted or even obliterated,
the cystic duct closed, and the neighboring portion of the liver the
seat of sclerosis.Such inflammatory exudations about the gall-bladder
may become the seat of malignant disease--of scirrhus.Several examples
of this have been reported, and one has occurred in my own practice.The contact of a gall-stone, especially of a polyangular stone, may
cause ulceration of the mucous membrane.This is the more apt to occur
if the muscular layer of the gall-bladder is hypertrophied, especially
if certain fasciculi are thickened and overacting, leaving intervening
parts weak and yielding to the pressure of the stone forced in by the
spasmodically contracting muscles.Finally yielding, the stone and
other contents of the gall-bladder escape into the cavity of the
abdomen.Adhesions to neighboring parts may prevent rupture.Such
adhesions are contracted with the colon, the duodenum, the stomach, and
other organs.In some rare instances the closed gall-bladder has
undergone a gradual process of calcification, the mucous membrane
losing its proper structure, the muscular layer degenerating, and a
slow deposit of lime salts taking place, the ultimate result being that
the biliary concretions are enclosed in a permanent shell.As above indicated, biliary concretions may remain where deposited for
an indefinite period.Very often they migrate from the point of
formation, the gall-bladder, into the duodenum, producing
characteristic {1068} symptoms called hepatic colic.As the size of the
ducts increases from above downward, obviously but little vis a tergo
is needed to propel the concretions onward.The chief agency in the
migration of these bodies is the discharge of bile.Common observation
shows that the symptoms of hepatic colic usually declare themselves in
two or three hours after a meal--at that time when the presence of the
chyme in the duodenum solicits the flow of bile.The gall-bladder
contracts on its contents with an energy in direct ratio to the amount
of bile present, and with the gush of fluid the concretion is whirled
into the duct.Once there, the cystic duct being unprovided with
muscular fibres, the onward progress of the stone must depend on the
flow of bile; and, as the canal is devious, this may not always carry
the concretion into the common duct.Just behind the neck of the
gall-bladder the duct makes an angle somewhat abrupt, and here also its
folds project into the canal, so that at this point the stone is apt to
lodge; but much depends on the size and shape of the calculus.If it
pass through the cystic duct, the inflammation resulting may close the
canal, several instances of which have fallen under my observation.The
next point where stoppage of the migrating calculus may, and frequently
does, occur is the orifice of the common duct in the duodenum.This
orifice has a funnel shape, the smaller extremity toward the intestine,
the object of this being to prevent the entrance into the duct of
foreign bodies from the intestine.A diverticulum is thereby made
(Vater's) in which a concretion may lodge, partly or wholly preventing
the escape of bile into the bowel.The various forces concerned in the
propulsion of the concretion onward from the common duct into the
intestine are the discharges of bile, the contraction of the few
muscular fibres in the walls of the duct, the respiratory movements,
especially forced expiration, coughing, sneezing, vomiting,
defecation--in fact, all of those acts in which the abdominal muscles,
the diaphragm, and the sphincters are simultaneously brought into
strong contraction.The symptoms produced by the migration and stoppage
of a concretion will vary according to the size and shape of the stone,
and the consequent diminution in the amount of bile discharged or its
complete arrest.In other words, the stone may be firmly wedged in,
completely closing the canal against the passage of bile, or it may lie
loosely in the diverticulum Vateri, acting as a sort of ball valve, now
permitting a gush of bile, and now stopping the passage-way more or
less tightly.The migration of calculi may take place by ulcerating through into
neighboring hollow organs.Usually the first step consists in stoppage
of the bile.To the accumulating bile mucus is added, and the
gall-bladder or the duct--usually the common or cystic duct--dilates,
often to a considerable extent, and, adhesions forming, discharge
ultimately takes place through some neighboring hollow organ.The
routes pursued by such fistulous communications are various.The organs
most frequently penetrated are the stomach, duodenum, and colon, less
often the urinary passages, and very rarely the portal vein.Numerous
examples of external discharge of calculi have been reported.The most
usual, as it is the most direct, is the fistulous connection of the
gall-bladder or common duct with the duodenum.Solitary stones of
immense size have been thus discharged.Murchison[167] gives references
to many interesting {1069} examples, and the various volumes of
_Transactions of the Pathological Society_ are rich in illustrative
cases.The symptoms produced by the migration of calculi by the natural
route and by ulceration into other organs will be hereafter considered.[Footnote 167: _Clinical Lectures on the Diseases of the Liver_, 2d
ed., p.487 _et seq._]

SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF GALL-STONES AT THEIR ORIGINAL
SITE.--Very large calculi or numerous small ones may be present in the
biliary passages without causing any recognizable symptoms.The
migration of these bodies by the natural channel and by ulceration into
the duodenum may also be accomplished without any local or systemic
disturbance.[168] That the retention of calculi may not induce any
characteristic reaction by which they may be recognized is probably due
to the fact that the gall-bladder, in which they chiefly form,
possesses but slight sensibility, and as it is in a constantly changing
state of distension or emptiness according to the amount of bile
present, it is obvious that a foreign body made up of the biliary
constituents, and having nearly the same specific gravity as the bile,
is not likely to cause any uneasiness or recognizable functional
disturbances.Furthermore, the slowness with which biliary concretions
form enables the organ to accommodate itself to the new conditions.The
lack of sensibility which is a feature of the gall-bladder, and which I
have had the opportunity to ascertain by actual puncture in an
individual not anaesthetized, is in some instances supported by a
general state of lowered acuteness of perception.There are great
differences in respect to readiness of appreciation and promptness of
response to all kinds of excitation in different individuals.To what
cause soever we may ascribe the lack of sensibility, the fact remains
that in not a few cases of gall-stones in the gall-bladder there are no
symptoms to indicate their presence.On the other hand, there are some
disturbances that have a certain significance.[Footnote 168: Amongst the numerous examples of this kind to be found
recorded may be mentioned the case reported by M. L. Garnier, Agrege a
la Faculte de Medecine de Nancy (_Archives de Physiologie normale et
pathologique_, No.176): An hepatic calculus, weighing 24.5
grammes, was discharged without any symptoms or even consciousness on
the part of the patient, a man of sixty years.He had had colic and
jaundice, but these subsided entirely, and there was no further
disturbance.As has happened in so many instances, this stone must have
ulcerated through into the bowel without causing any recognizable
symptoms.]The subjective signs are uneasiness--a deep-seated sensation of
soreness--felt in the right hypochondrium, increased by taking a full
inspiration and by decubitus on the left side.Pain or soreness,
sometimes an acute pain, is experienced under the scapula near the
angle, at or about the acromion process, and sometimes at the nape of
the neck.In one case under my observation within the past year a
patient who had had several attacks of hepatic colic, the usual
polyangular stones having been recovered, had from time to time severe
pain over the right side of the neck, shoulder, and scapula,
accompanied by a severe herpes zoster in the district affected by the
pain.This is of course an extreme example, but it is very suggestive
of the relation which may exist between hepatic disturbances and
shingles.Attacks of gastric pain coming on some time after food, and
not soon after, as is the case in true gastralgia, are usual in the
early stage of the disease--are constant, according to Cyr,[169] who
quotes approvingly an observation of Leared on this point.Migraine
{1070} or sick headache and vertigo occur in many cases, but it may
well be doubted whether these symptoms are not due to the accompanying
gastro-duodenal catarrh, which is a nearly constant symptom.Acidity,
flatulence, epigastric oppression, a bitter taste, a muddy rather
bilious complexion, and constipation are symptoms belonging to catarrh
of the gastro-duodenal mucous membrane.Some additional information may be supplied by
palpation.When the gall-bladder is distended with gall-stones, or is
in the enlarged state which occurs when the common duct is obstructed,
it may project beneath the inferior border of the liver far enough to
be felt.In thin persons a grating sound, produced by the friction of
the calculi, may be heard, the stethoscope being applied as palpation
is made over the hypochondrium.It is rare that these symptoms can be
elicited, since the calculous affection of the liver occurs for the
most part in persons of full habit, in whom the abdominal walls are too
thick to allow of the necessary manipulation.There may be also some
tenderness on pressure along the inferior margin of the ribs,
especially in the region of the gall-bladder.[Footnote 169: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE MIGRATION OF GALL-STONES BY THE NATURAL
CHANNELS.--A calculus passing into the cystic duct from the
gall-bladder causes the disturbance known as hepatic colic or bilious
colic, because of the jaundice which accompanies the major part of
these seizures.But jaundice is not a necessary element in these cases;
it is not until the concretion reaches the common duct that the passage
of bile into the intestine is interfered with.The gall-bladder has a
function rather conservative than essential, for its duct may be
permanently closed without apparently affecting the health.The time when an attack of hepatic colic is most likely to occur would
seem to be determined by the flow of bile; for this, as has been
stated, is the chief factor in moving calculi along the ducts.As, no
doubt, the presence of the chyme in the duodenum is the stimulus for
the production of bile and also for the contractions of the
gall-bladder, it follows that a few hours after meals is the time when
the attacks of hepatic colic would a priori be expected.This is in
accord with experience, but there are exceptions.In one of the most
formidable cases with which the writer has had to deal--the diagnosis
confirmed by the recovery of the calculi--the most severe attacks
occurred in the early morning.According to Harley,[170] colic from the
passage of inspissated bile occurs when the stomach and duodenum are
most nearly empty--from ten at night until ten in the morning--and this
he relies on as a means of diagnosis, but the exceptions are too
numerous to assign much importance to this circumstance.[Footnote 170: _On Diseases of the Liver_, p.The onset of pain is usually sudden, but it may develop slowly from a
vague uneasiness in the region of the gall-bladder; or after some pain
and soreness at this point, accompanied by nausea, even vomiting, the
paroxysm will begin with very acute pain.The situation of the pain is
by no means constant, and usually varies in position in the same case.The point of maximum intensity is near the ensiform cartilage, outward
and downward two or three inches, about the point of junction of the
cystic and common duct.From or about this region the pain radiates
through the epigastrium, the right hypochondrium, upward into the
chest, {1071} backward under the scapula, and downward and inward
toward the umbilicus.In some instances under my observation the most
acute suffering was located in the right iliac region, in others in the
lumbar region, and in still others in the epigastrium.The position of
the pain may be such as to draw attention from the liver, and thus
greatly confuse the diagnosis.In a well-defined attack the pain is
intense, shooting, and boring, irregularly paroxysmal; the patient
writhes in agony, screams and groans, rolls from side to side, or walks
partly bent, holding the part with a gentle pressure or rubbing with an
agonized tension of feeling.Meanwhile the countenance is expressive of
the intensest suffering, is pallid and drawn, and the body is covered
with a cold sweat.Nausea presently supervenes, and with the efforts to
vomit a keen thrust of pain and a sense of cramp dart through the
epigastrium and side.Very considerable depression of the vital powers
occurs; the pulse becomes small, feeble, and slow, or very rapid and
feeble.The patient may pass into a condition of collapse, and, indeed,
the pain of hepatic colic may cause death by sudden arrest of the
heart's action.The cases which prove fatal in this way are doubtless
examples of fatty heart, the degeneration of the cardiac muscle being a
result of the action of the same factors as those which cause
gall-stones to form, if the relation of general steatosis to these
bodies which I have set forth prove to be true.The pain is not
continuously so violent as above expressed: it remits from time to
time, and seems about to cease altogether when a sudden access of
anguish is experienced and the former suffering is renewed, and, it may
be, more savagely than before.The pain of an attack of hepatic colic
has no fixed duration.It will depend on the size of the calculus, on
the point where impacted, and on the impressionability of the subject.The severity of the seizures varies within very wide limits.The attack
may consist in a transient colic-like pain, in a mere sense of
soreness, in epigastric uneasiness with nausea, or it may be an agony
sufficient to cause profound depression of the powers of life--to
destroy life, indeed.The usual attack of hepatic colic is one in which
severe suffering is experienced until relief is obtained by the
exhibition of anodynes.Under these circumstances the subsidence of the
pain may be rather gradual or it may be sudden: in the former case, as
the effects of the anodyne are produced, we may suppose that the spasm
subsides and the stone moves onward, at last dropping into the
intestine: an enchanting sense of relief is at once experienced.Very
serious nervous disturbances may accompany the pain.Paroxysms of
hysteria may be excited in the hysterical; convulsions occur in those
having the predisposition to them from any cause, and in the epileptic.The onset of a severe seizure is announced by chilliness, sometimes by
a severe chill.Now and then the paroxysms commence with the chill, and
the pain follows.It occasionally happens that the attacks in respect
to the order in which the symptoms occur, and in their regularity as to
time, behave like an ordinary ague.In fact, there appear to be two
modes or manifestations of the attacks of hepatic colic in malarious
localities: those in which the phenomena are merely an outcome of the
passage of the calculi; those in which an attack of intermittent fever
is excited by the pain and disturbance of hepatic colic.To the first
Charcot[171] {1072} has applied the phrase fievre intermittente
hepatique.It is supposed to correspond pathogenetically to urethral
fever produced by the passage of a catheter.On the other hand, the
second form of intermittent can occur only under the conditions
producing ague.A calculus passing in a subject affected with chronic
malarial poisoning, the latent malarial influence is aroused into full
activity, and the resulting seizure is compounded of the two factors.The truly malarial form of calculus fever differs from the traumatic in
its regular periodicity and the methodical sequence of the attacks,
which occur in the order of an intermittent quotidian or tertian.During the attacks of hepatic colic, when protracted and severe, a
sense of chilliness or distinct chills occur, sometimes with the
regularity of an intermittent; but these differ from the seizures which
the chill inaugurates at distinct times, the intervening period being
free from disturbance.[Footnote 171: _Lecons sur la Maladies du Foie_, p.The fever which accompanies some severe paroxysms of hepatic colic has
a distinctly intermittent character, hence the name applied to it by
Charcot.There are two forms of this calculus fever as it occurs in
malarious localities: one intermittent, coming on during a protracted
case, and immediately connected with and dependent on the passage of
the stone; the other a regular intermittent quotidian or tertian, which
determines and accompanies the paroxysm of colic.A case occurring
under my observation very recently, in which these phenomena were
exhibited and the calculi recovered, proves the existence of such a
form of the malady.In this case with the onset of the pain a severe
chill occurred; then the fever rose, followed by the sweat, during
which the pain ceased, but much soreness and tenderness about the
region of the gall-bladder, and jaundice, followed in the usual way.At
the so-called septenary periods also attacks come on in accordance with
the usual laws of recurrence of malarial fevers.In many instances, probably a
majority, the pulse is not accelerated, rather slowed, and the
temperature does not rise above normal.The inflammation which follows
an attack of hepatic colic will be accompanied by some elevation of the
body-heat, and fever will occur when ulceration of the duct and
perforation cause a local peritonitis; but these conditions are quite
apart from those which obtain in the migration of calculi by the
natural channel.Nausea and vomiting are invariable symptoms of hepatic colic.First the
contents of the stomach are brought up, then some glairy mucus only,
with repeated and exhausting straining efforts; and with the sudden
cessation of the pain there may appear in the vomit a quantity of
bilious matter, the contents of the gall-bladder liberated by the
passage of the stone into the intestine.If bile is present in the
vomit from the beginning, it may be concluded that the obstruction is
not complete.The abdomen may be distended with gas--is
usually, indeed, when constipation exists.Free purgation gives great
relief.The stools are composed of scybalae chiefly at first, afterward
of a brownish offensive liquid, and when jaundice supervenes they
become whitish in color, pasty, and semi-solid.Now and then it happens
that a copious movement of the bowels takes place as the attack is
impending, but during the paroxysm no action occurs.Jaundice is an important, but not an invariable, symptom.It comes on
within the first twenty-four hours succeeding the paroxysm, and appears
{1073} first in the conjunctiva, thence spreading over the body
generally.The intensity of the jaundice depends on the amount of the
obstruction: if complete, the body is intensely yellow; and if partial,
the tint may be very light.The very slight degree of obstruction which
suffices to determine the flow of bile backward has been already
stated.There may be no jaundice, although all the other symptoms of
the passage of gall-stones may be present.Such is the state of the
case when a calculus enters and is arrested in the cystic duct.Under
these circumstances the natural history differs from that which obtains
when the obstruction is in the common duct and ends abruptly by the
discharge of the calculus into the intestine.After the persistence of
the symptoms of hepatic colic for a variable period without jaundice,
this sign of obstruction may appear, indicating the removal of the
stone from the cystic into the common duct.The symptoms accompanying
the jaundice--the hebetude of mind, the slow pulse, the itching of the
skin, the dark- urine--have been sufficiently detailed in the
section on that topic in another part of this article.The duration of the jaundice is different in different cases, and is
influenced by the degree and persistence of the obstruction.When the
obstruction is partial and the stone is soon removed, the jaundice will
be slight and will disappear in a day or two; on the other hand, when
the stone completely blocks the passage and is slowly dislodged, the
jaundice will be intense and will persist for ten days to two weeks.After the paroxysm has passed, if severe, the liver will be swollen,
more or less tenderness will be developed by pressure, and in some
instances, a local peritonitis coming on, there will occur the usual
symptoms of that condition.Although all the symptoms produced by the passage of biliary calculi
may be present, some uncertainty will always be felt unless the body
causing the disturbance is recovered from the feces.A
properly-conducted search is therefore necessary.As this is so often
done inefficiently and the calculus not found, an error of diagnosis
may seem to have occurred.Every stool should be examined in the mode
hereinafter described for a number of days after the attack until the
calculus is found.It should be remembered that only air-dried calculi
float on water.The stool, as soon as passed, should be slowly stirred
up in water sufficient to make a thin mixture, and all solid particles
removed for further examination, the thinner portion poured off, and
more water added from time to time until only solids remain at last.It
should not be forgotten that masses of inspissated bile, biliary sand,
may produce symptoms not unlike those due to gall-stones proper, and
hence all particles having the appearance of this material should be
examined chemically.Place some of the supposed bile on a white plate
and pour over it some drops of strong sulphuric acid, when the
biliverdin will take on a brilliant scarlet color.The discharge of particles of inspissated bile causes symptoms not
unlike those due to the migration of biliary calculi, but there are
points of difference.A strongly-marked case diagnosticated biliary
calculi, and in which masses of inspissated bile were discharged in
great quantity, will furnish the symptomatology to be now described.The onset of the paroxysms of pain is less abrupt than is the case with
gall-stones, and the attacks may occur at any time; the pain also
subsides more gradually, and hardly {1074} ceases at any time, but
revives every now and then, so that several days, even weeks, may be
occupied with one seizure.Jaundice is less apt to follow, and indeed
well-defined jaundice rarely occurs in this affection.There is much
swelling of the liver, also considerable tenderness, and relief is most
certainly afforded by free purgation, anodynes seeming rather to keep
up the disturbance, probably by checking the hepatic secretions.Attacks of hepatic colic may be expected to recur when a calculus with
multiple facets migrates, but the time when its associates may be
expected to move cannot be predicated on any data now available.Single
attacks may happen at intervals of weeks, months, or years.The
migration of one large stone may so dilate the ducts as to facilitate
the passage of those that remain behind, thus ensuring a recurrence of
the seizures at an early period.IMPACTION OF CALCULI AND MIGRATION BY ARTIFICIAL ROUTES.--The point at
which impaction takes place is an element of great importance.The size
of the calculus is far from being decisive as to the certainty of
impaction or as to the untoward results.A not unfrequent accident is
the blocking of the cystic duct at its opening, thus preventing the
influx or outgo of bile from the gall-bladder.If the stone does not
ulcerate through, in this position it does no damage, for the
gall-bladder, as has been stated, may be closed without any apparent
detriment.Just at the bend of the cystic duct, near its origin, is the
point where arrest of a calculus is most likely to take place.The next
most likely point is the duodenal end of the common duct.When
impaction occurs a local inflammation comes on, an exudation is poured
out, ulceration begins, and presently the peritoneum is reached.Adhesions usually form with the neighboring organs, but now and then
perforation takes place, and bile, pus, and the calculus are
precipitated into the peritoneal cavity.A fatal peritonitis follows,
as a rule; but rarely the inflammation is localized, and an abscess
forms which pursues the usual course of such accumulations; or
adhesions may take place about the site of the perforation and prevent
a general inflammation of the peritoneum.In this way a very large sac
may be produced, with the ultimate result of rupture into the general
cavity, although a fistulous communication may be established with some
neighboring organ, permitting safe discharge in this direction.A gall-stone impacted in one of the hepatic ducts or in the main duct,
ulcerating through, may form an abscess not distinguishable from other
solitary hepatic abscesses except by the presence of the concretion
causing the mischief and the absence of the usual conditions giving
rise to these accumulations of pus.It is probable that fatal abscesses
of the liver not infrequently are caused in this way in extra-tropical
countries.Adhesions forming to neighboring hollow organs or to the
external integument, such abscesses discharge, carrying out the
calculus with them.In this way may be explained the discharge by the
intestine of calculi much too large to have passed by the natural route
and unattended by the usual symptoms of hepatic colic.These
gastro-intestinal biliary fistulae extend from the gall-bladder and the
larger ducts to the stomach, to the duodenum, and to the transverse
colon; but of these the communication with the stomach is the least
common.The adhesion of the gall-bladder or common duct to the duodenum
or colon may be direct, exudations uniting {1075} the two parts without
the intervention of an abscess cavity, or such a sac or cavity may be
interposed.In some cases the discharge of biliary calculi is effected
through these routes with so little disturbance as to escape notice, or
the symptoms may be only vague indications of a local inflammation in
the neighborhood of the liver.Biliary fistulae communicating externally, caused by the migration of
calculi, are comparatively common.They have the clinical history, and
are usually treated as cases, of hepatic abscess.Sometimes hundreds of
calculi are thus discharged.In such instances it may be assumed that
communication has been established with the gall-bladder.Hepatic
abscess thus due to the migration of calculi may discharge into the
pelvis of the kidney, into the ascending vena cava, or through the
lung, but these places of outlet are comparatively uncommon.COURSES AND COMPLICATIONS.--Although symptoms cease for the time being
when the calculus passes into the duodenum, and although in most
instances no after unpleasant effects are experienced, there are cases
in which the presence of the concretion in the intestine proves to be
fruitful of mischief.Calculi of very large size--from a pigeon's to a
hen's egg--are also found in the intestine, without the occurrence of
symptoms indicative of their migration.It has been shown that this
silent migration of calculi from the liver-passages to the intestinal
is not uncommon.Hepatic concretions are distinguishable from the
intestinal by their crystalline form and by their composition.The
former are usually polyangular, and are composed of cholesterin
crystallized about a nucleus of bile-pigment, inspissated bile, or
mucus.After entrance into the intestine, lime salts and mucus are
deposited in successive layers, so that the form of the calculus is
modified and its size increased.The solitary ovoid concretion is most
frequently found in the intestine, without previous symptoms of hepatic
source, and, although increased in size in the intestine, it retains
its original shape.A specimen of this kind now in my possession
illustrates these points.It is composed of cholesterin crystallized in
radiating lines and concentric rings about a central nucleus of
inspissated bile.Around the hepatic concretion there have formed
layers of lime and mucus since it has reached the intestine, and after
drying this rind became brittle and was readily detached.The
polyangular calculus is apt to form the nucleus of a scybala-like mass
of feces; hence in the search for these bodies every such mass should
be broken up.An example of this has recently come under my own
observation.Concretions of all sizes, having reached the intestines,
as a rule pass down without creating any commotion, and are silently
discharged.Obstruction of the bowels is one of the results.A great may cases have
been collected by Murchison,[172] as many more by Leichtenstern,[173]
of impaction of the intestine produced by an accumulation of feces
about a biliary concretion.A calculus may be retained in a fold or
diverticulum of the small intestine, and may indeed cause a loop to be
formed which in turn readily twists, becoming an immovable obstruction.This mode of obstructing the bowels is less common than the simple
impaction.It is affirmed by some authorities, especially by Von
Schuppel, that obstruction of the bowels--impaction--is more often
caused by stones that have ulcerated through into the {1076} intestines
than by those that have descended by the common duct; and this
conclusion must be reached if jaundice has not been present.It is not
only the size of the calculus which determines impaction, as has been
stated: several may be agglutinated in one mass, and reflex spasm of
the muscular layer may be induced by their presence in the bowel.Nevertheless, some enormous concretions have been found in the canal,
and others have been discharged without special trouble.Hilton Fagge
exhibited to the Pathological Society[174] of London two gall-stones
passed with the stools, measuring 2-1/2 by 1-1/5 inches in long and
short diameter, and Fauconneau-Dufresne[175] refers to concretions of
the size of a hen's egg.Mention has been made of one in the writer's
possession of the size of a pullet's egg, which, until its discharge,
caused a train of characteristic symptoms.These immense bodies may
have ulcerated through from the gall-bladder or may have grown by
successive deposits of carbonate and phosphate of lime after reaching
the intestine.[Footnote 172: _Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, p.[Footnote 173: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 174: _Transactions of the London Pathological Society_, vol.cit._]

The symptoms caused by the presence of concretions in the intestines
are, when pronounced, sufficiently characteristic.At a variable period
after an attack or attacks of hepatic colic the disturbance begins.The
condition of impaction above referred to does not differ from ordinary
fecal accumulation.It is true that occasionally the intestinal
irritation due to the presence of these bodies in some instances
preceded the symptoms of impaction, but usually there is no evidence to
indicate that the stoppage of the bowel is due to anything else than
feces.The irritability manifested by the intestinal mucous membrane
when gall-stones are present varies remarkably.There may be only some
ill-defined pain which, as a rule, indicates the position of the
calculus, or it may be pain with a feeling of soreness, or it may take
the form of violent colic, with nausea, vomiting, and depression.In my
own cases pain was experienced at or near the ileo-caecal valve, where
one was lodged, and along the descending colon, where the others were;
the pain and soreness ceased when these bodies were discharged.In a few instances gall-stones are brought up by vomiting.The most
remarkable example of this is a case to be found in the _Transactions
of the Pathological Society_ (vol.129): A woman ninety-four
years of age vomited a stone the size of a nutmeg.In the reported
examples violent pain, nausea, and much vomiting preceded the discharge
of the calculus.Like other foreign bodies, a gall-stone may ulcerate through the
intestine, producing fatal peritonitis.Many conditions due to the presence of biliary concretions, and which
arise during their migrations, may be viewed as complications.Many of
those produced directly have been described as a part of the proper
course of the malady; others are local and reflex, and these may with
propriety be considered as complications.First in importance are those
due to obstruction and the local inflammation.The passage of a calculus along the duct excites an inflammation of the
mucous membrane, which by contiguity of tissue invades the peritoneal
layer if the stone is retained for a sufficient time, and especially if
it is immovably lodged.The stoppage in the flow of bile leads to
dilatation of the ducts, and a change takes place in the character of
that fluid, {1077} owing to the admixture of mucus with the bile and to
the pouring out of a pathological secretion: it loses the bilious
appearance and becomes a merely sero-purulent fluid.Serious changes
ensue in the structure of the liver, as was first suggested by O. Wyss
and Leyden, and afterward more especially by Wickham Legg[176] and
Charcot.[177] A ligature to the common duct in animals is followed in
so short a time as two weeks by hyperplasia of the connective tissue
and atrophy of the gland-elements.It has been ascertained that similar
changes ensue in man from the impaction of a calculus in the common
duct.Under these circumstances the size of the liver, as indicated by
the area of hepatic dulness, at first enlarges, and subsequently more
or less contraction, coincident with the atrophy, ensues.When the
cystic duct is obstructed the contents of the gall-bladder increase,
and become ultimately sero-purulent (dropsy).In some instances, the
walls of the abdomen being thin, a globular elastic tumor may be felt
projecting from beneath the liver.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports for 1873_.See also
_Treatise on Diseases of the Liver_, by the same author, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 177: _Lecons_.]Angiocholitis, or inflammation of the duct, is caused by the passage,
especially by the impaction, of a calculus.The inflammation may extend
by contiguity of tissue and involve the surrounding parts.Several
cases have been examined by the writer in which the gall-bladder and
the cystic and common duct were imbedded in a mass of organized
exudation.An extension of inflammation may take place, and be confined
to the hepatic peritoneum.Heavy organized exudations will form,
adhesions be contracted to the diaphragm, to the parietal peritoneum,
and to the neighboring organs, and the capsule, thickened and
contracting, will ultimately induce changes in the structure of the
adjacent part of the liver.When the inflammation extends to the
peritoneum there are the usual systemic symptoms, and locally acute
pain, increased by the respiratory movements and by pressure, and
assuming a constrictive character; nausea and frequent vomiting, and
often a very troublesome hiccough, caused, doubtless, by implication of
some branches of the phrenic nerve; constipation, etc.The relation of biliary colic to cancer of the biliary passages was
first noted by Frerichs, who ascertained the occurrence of gall-stones
in 9 out of 11 cases of cancer of these parts.Hilton Fagge[178]
reports a case of the kind, and the writer can add another from his own
observations.The most important of the reflex symptoms are those pertaining to the
circulatory system.The action of the heart becomes irregular in rhythm
and diminishes in force.The circulation of the bile acids in the blood
causes slowing of the heart's action, as has been set forth in the
section on jaundice; but that is a direct consequence, and is not a
reflex impression.Potain was the first to show that the structure of
the heart is affected.A mitral murmur is a recognized symptom in the
icterus of gall-stones, but Potain[179] has shown that the real seat of
this murmur is the tricuspid, and that the affection of the heart is a
dilatation of the right cavities.The physiological reason for this
condition of the heart is the rise of tension in the pulmonary artery,
which is secondary to irritation of the splanchnic nerves; and to this
factor is also due the reduplication of the first sound and the
accentuation of the second sound--characteristic signs of the cardiac
change in these cases.[Footnote 179: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affec.cit._]

{1078} There are certain reflex nervous troubles in cases of hepatic
colic, some of them of great importance.One of the lesser troubles is
herpes zoster.A very violent attack in the course of the distribution
of the first, second, and third cervical nerves has happened in a case
under the writer's observation.There have been reported from time to
time cases of sudden death during the paroxysms of hepatic colic, in
which a calculus lodged in Vater's diverticulum, at the intestinal
extremity of the common duct, was the cause of the accident.An
explanation of this result is to be found in the intimate nervous
communications between the liver and the heart through the solar plexus
and the large number of ganglia contained in Vater's diverticulum.The
most severe pain is felt as the calculus is passing through the orifice
of the common duct into the intestine, and here also the spasm of the
muscular fibre is most tense.The so-called crushing-blow experiment of
Goltz illustrates how intense suffering, such as the passage of a
gall-stone, can paralyze the heart through the solar plexus.The
depression of the heart's action does not always occur on the instant,
but it may be gradual--several hours, even a day or two, being occupied
in the suspension of activity.Leigh of Liverpool[180] has reported an
example of death in six hours in a female of thirty, previously in good
health; Cornillon,[181] another in a female of fifty-three, who died in
twelve hours from the beginning of the paroxysm; Williamson,[182] a
female of fifty-one years, who expired on the fourth day;
Habershon,[183] two, who died during the paroxysms at a period not
stated; and Brouardel, one which was the subject of a medico-legal
investigation.In the first case the calculus was yet in the
gall-bladder, the appearances indicating that persistent spasms had
occurred to force the calculus into the cystic duct; in the others in
which the position of the stone is mentioned, it was engaged in the
orifice of the common duct or had reached the intestine.[Footnote 180: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1867, vol.[Footnote 182: _The Lancet_ (London), vol.[Footnote 183: _Lectures on the Pneumogastric_, 3d Lecture.]In several instances sudden death has resulted from uncontrollable
vomiting induced by the paroxysms of hepatic colic.Trousseau[184]
mentions a case in which strangulated hernia and death ensued in
consequence of the violent vomiting brought on by the passage of a
calculus.[Footnote 184: _Clinique medicale_.]DIAGNOSIS.--Unless the distension of the gall-bladder is sufficient to
cause a recognizable tumor, gall-stones in that organ do not produce
symptoms by which they can be diagnosticated.If sudden attacks of
violent pain in the right hypochondrium, accompanied by nausea and
vomiting and followed by jaundice, have occurred from time to time,
then the presence of biliary concretions may be suspected if the
symptoms belonging to them are present in the intervals between the
seizures.The migrations of calculi produce symptoms so characteristic
that error is hardly possible.The only disorders with which an attack
of hepatic colic may be confounded are gastralgia and hepatalgia.As
regards the first, the distinction is made by the seat of pain, by the
absence of after jaundice, and by the lack of a concretion passed by
stool.As the diagnosis may depend on the finding a concretion, the
writer must again affirm the importance of a properly-conducted search
of all the stools passed for several days after the paroxysm.{1079} Hepatalgia is diagnosticated with great difficulty, for the pain
has the same seat, the same character, but as a rule it does not
terminate so abruptly, is not accompanied by such severe vomiting and
depression, jaundice is absent, and no stone can be found in the
evacuations.Both gastralgia and hepatalgia occur in the subjects of
neurotic disturbances--in the pale, delicate, and hysterical--whereas,
as a rule, hepatic colic happens to the obese, to the persons of active
digestion addicted to the pleasures of the table.The passage of calculi may be confounded with flatulent colic, with the
pain caused by lead and other mineral poisons, with impaction, internal
strangulation, local peritonitis, and similar causes of sudden and
violent pain.The differentiation is made by attention to the seat and
character of the pain, by the previous history, and especially by the
absence of jaundice and of a concretion.From renal colic the hepatic
is separated by the position of the pain, by the direction taken by it,
and by the retraction of the testicle, the irritability of the bladder,
and the appearance of blood in the urine--all characteristic symptoms
of the renal affection.TREATMENT.--The treatment of biliary concretions includes the remedial
management for the calculi in position, for the paroxysms of hepatic
colic caused by the migration of these bodies, and for the results and
complications.Treatment of the Calculus State: Of Inspissated Bile.--As the particles
of inspissated bile are deposited along the larger hepatic ducts, and
form in consequence of a deficiency in the amount of glycocholate and
taurocholate of soda, two methods of treatment are to be carried out:
free purgation by an active cholagogue to wash out the offending
substance, and the exhibition of a soda salt to promote the alkalinity
of the bile and the consequent solution of the bile-pigment.Harley's
method, which he strongly urges, consists in the administration of "one
or two drachms of sulphate of soda in a bitter infusion every morning
before breakfast, or from twenty to thirty grains of bicarbonate of
soda, along with a drachm of taraxacum-juice in a bitter infusion,
every night at bedtime at regulated intervals for a month or so,
according to the constitution of the patient and the severity of the
symptoms."As persons who suffer from inspissation of the bile are naturally
bilious, it is of the first importance in the prophylactic treatment to
regulate the diet.Indulgence in malt liquors, in fatty and saccharine
articles of food, must be forbidden.Acid fermentation in the course of
duodenal digestion should be prevented by withholding the starches and
sugars.Peptonized foods, given with an alkali, are highly useful.Milk, fresh meat, and the succulent vegetables are the proper
constituents of a diet for these subjects.Bread is one of the most
offending articles, and should be restricted in amount as much as
possible.Next to a suitable diet, systematic exercise is a measure of the
highest utility in these cases.A daily morning sponge bath of a weak
alkaline water not only maintains the skin in a healthy state, but also
promotes the oxidation processes of the body.The alkaline mineral
waters of Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, and other States, especially
of the Bethesda Spring of Wisconsin, may be drunk with great advantage
to accomplish the same purpose.{1080} We possess direct means for preventing inspissation of the
bile--remedies which act in the physiological way by increasing the
proportion of glycocholate and taurocholate of soda.Harley prefers the
sulphate and bicarbonate for this purpose, but my experience is in
favor of the cholate and phosphate of sodium, especially the latter;
for, whilst it plays the part of a soda salt, it exerts a decided
cholagogue action, thus effecting the results achieved by the combined
use of sulphate of soda and taraxacum.A cure may be confidently looked
for in this malady by the persistent use of sodium phosphate--drachm j
ter in die.It seems to act more efficiently when given dissolved in
hot water.The paroxysms of hepatic colic due to the passage of inspissated bile
are to be treated in the same way as when this condition of things is
caused by the migration of formed calculi.The action of cholagogue
purgatives is more decidedly beneficial in the attacks due to the
passage of inspissated bile.Biliary Calculi in Situ.--Notwithstanding their crystalline form and
firmness of texture, it is possible to effect the gradual solution of
biliary calculi.Outside of the body it is easy to dissolve a calculus
in chloroform, in Durande's remedy, etc., if time enough be given, but
the problem is a far more difficult one when the calculus is in
position in the gall-bladder or in a hepatic duct.As Trousseau[185]
has wisely observed, it is not safe to apply to conditions within the
body conclusions reached by experiments in the laboratory.Nevertheless, facts are known which justify the belief that an
impression may be made on concretions in the gall-bladder.The motion
of respiration and the voluntary actions of the abdominal muscles cause
more or less attrition and breaking off of the angles and margins of
the crystals, thus permitting the solvent action of the bile.If,
however, the bile continues in the state in which it was at the time of
the crystallization of the cholesterin, it will make no impression on
this substance.We have now the means of restoring its power to
dissolve crystallized cholesterin.As a necessary preliminary, fracture
of the crystals must be effected.This may be accomplished, when the
natural forces have failed to effect it, by manipulation of the
gall-bladder through the walls of the abdomen, but especially by
faradization.Excellent results have been achieved by this
last-mentioned expedient, but no satisfactory explanation has been made
of its methodus medendi, unless we accept the mechanical effect of the
muscular movements.In applying the faradic current an electrode is
introduced into the rectum, and the other, a sponge well moistened, is
placed over the gall-bladder.An interrupted galvanic current is
indicated, the electrodes in the position just mentioned, when a
migrating calculus is stopped on its way.Such an application has
rendered important service in a few cases.[Footnote 185: _Clinique medicale de l'Hotel Dieu de Paris_.]Except that calculi have been found in a state of decay, their angles
and edges broken, divided by cleavage, there is no evidence that they
have undergone solution when in situ, except the clinical evidence
which consists in a disappearance of the symptoms.The remedy of
Durande, which consists in a mixture of ether and turpentine--three
parts of the former and two of the latter--has been celebrated since
the close of the last century, and is yet much employed in France,
notably at Vichy.It {1081} is preferred by Cyr,[186] who advises its
administration in capsules taken immediately before meals.Chloroform
readily dissolves calculi out of the body, and hence it has been
proposed, and indeed much used, for the purpose of effecting their
solution in the gall-bladder; but, as Trousseau urges, there is no
warrant for the belief.Corlieu,[187] who first proposed its use, and
afterward Bouchut,[188] maintained that chloroform does exert this
solvent action, and reported cases in confirmation; but there are so
many sources of fallacy that such evidence must be viewed with
suspicion.It has usually been administered in small doses (five
minims) three times a day for a long period.That it is beneficial by
stimulating the flow of pancreatic secretion and by allaying spasms is
probably true, but that any quantity which can be administered in
safety will act as a solvent of cholesterin concretions cannot be
believed.[Footnote 186: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 187: _Gazette des Hopitaux_, 1856, June 19.][Footnote 188: _Bulletin gen.If solution of hepatic calculi is possible under any circumstances, the
most rational mode of effecting it would seem to be to restore that
condition of the bile which in the normal state maintains cholesterin
in the state of solution.Cholesterin is precipitated and crystallizes
about a nucleus when the glycocholate and taurocholate of soda are
deficient in amount.The agents most effective in restoring the solvent
power of the bile are the salts of soda, of which the sulphate is
preferred by Harley.In 1873 the cholate of soda was brought forward by
Schiff, who prescribed it in doses of 50 centigrammes (8 grains nearly)
three times a day, to be gradually increased until digestive or
circulatory troubles arose.This remedy, which is eminently rational
from the point of view above indicated, has apparently been of decided
service in many published cases and in the writer's experience.It will
be found, however, that five grains three times a day is as large a
quantity as can be easily borne.Another soda salt which in my own hands has proved in a high degree
effective is the phosphate.As has been explained when referring to its
use in cases of disorders due to inspissated bile, it has a distinct
cholagogue action, but the chief sources of its utility in this
affection are its chemical and resolvent powers.The usual quantity is
one drachm three times a day, dissolved in sufficient warm water.Bile itself, in the form of inspissated ox-gall, was formerly much
used, a scruple to a drachm being given three times a day, and not
without good results.It was also prescribed with chloride of ammonium.For the gastro-duodenal catarrh and the accompanying catarrh of the
bile-ducts this combination is sometimes useful.I have recently proposed a new expedient for effecting the solution of
hepatic calculi.This method consists in puncture of the gall-bladder
with a fine exploring-trocar, and the injection through the canula,
after withdrawing the stylet, of a suitable solvent.Durande's remedy,
chloroform, and other solvents can be introduced in this way without
injury to the parts.I have punctured the gall-bladder, removed its
contents, and explored its interior without damaging the organ in any
way and without leaving after traces.The measure proposed offers no
special difficulties in its execution.The Paroxysms of Hepatic Colic.--The pain of hepatic colic being {1082}
the most acute suffering known to man--in its severest form at
least--the most powerful anodynes are required.The measures employed
for relief of pain happen to be the most efficient for promoting the
expulsion of the calculus and for limiting, if not preventing, the
subsequent inflammation.As soon as the character of the seizure is
manifest a hypodermatic injection of morphine and atropine--1/8 to 1/2
grain of the former and 1/200 to 1/80 grain of the latter--should be
given; ether administered by inhalation if necessary; and by the
stomach chloroform, chlorodyne, or chloral.As the stomach is usually
exceedingly irritable, the subcutaneous injection of remedies is a
precious resource: this failing or contraindicated, relief may be given
by the rectal injection of laudanum or chlorodyne.As relief is often
afforded by the act of vomiting, the attempts to empty the stomach
should be encouraged, and to this end large draughts of warm water
should be given.Hot fomentations and mustard plaster should be applied
over the right hypochondrium, and an entire warm bath may be used if
available.Great relief is usually afforded by the action of purgatives.The
irritability of the stomach forbids the employment of drastic
purgatives, yet podophyllin resin is warmly commended by Dobell.It
must be given in small doses, and preferably dissolved in spirit.Calomel in one-grain doses, every four hours until it purges, allays
nausea and lessens the after-uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, but
mercurial treatment given with a view to a supposed cholagogue effect
only does evil by prolonged administration, especially if ptyalism is
induced.If evidences of portal congestion are present, such remedies
as euonymin, iridin, baptisin, and others of the cholagogue group give
good results.The most effective of the remedies of this kind is
ipecacuanha, given in purgative doses: the emesis induced by it favors
the extrusion of the stone, and the powerful cholagogue effect relieves
the portal congestion.Twenty grains at once, and repeated if need be
in three hours, is a suitable quantity.The various complications which may occur, and the results which follow
the migration of the calculus, require treatment adapted to the
conditions existing, and will be mentioned in the sections devoted to
these topics.Occlusion of the Biliary Passages; Stenosis of the Ductus Communis
Choledochus.DEFINITION.--By occlusion of the biliary passages is meant an
obstruction, internal or external, of the hepatic, cystic, or common
duct.The causes of the obstruction are various, but the results are
quite uniform; hence the term includes a complexus of symptoms of a
very distinctive type.Occlusion may be congenital or acquired: it is
the latter with which we have especially to deal.Stenosis signifies a narrowing which in its extremest form produces a
nearly complete obstruction; when the canal is entirely closed the term
occlusion is applied.Stenosis also may be congenital or acquired.PATHOGENY.--The conditions producing narrowing of a hepatic duct or its
complete obstruction are numerous, and some of them complex in their
relations.As regards the ducts themselves, the interference may {1083}
be entirely within the canal, or it may affect the walls, or it may be
wholly extraneous; as, for example, when a cancer of the pancreas
encroaches on the common duct.It will be convenient to consider the
causes of stenosis and obstruction from these points of view: 1,
internal; 2, of the duct walls; 3, extraneous.The most usual situations for the occurrence of those changes that lead
to occlusion by inflammatory adhesions are the beginning of the cystic
duct, obstruction of which is of little moment, and the end of the
common duct, which finally proves fatal.The passage of a large polyangular calculus may cause such irritation,
abrasion of the epithelium, and subsequent inflammatory exudation as to
effect a direct union of the opposing sides of the canal.This takes
place at the beginning of the cystic duct especially, since, owing to
the spasm of the gall-bladder and the absence of muscular fibres in the
walls of the duct, the stone crushes into, without passing through, the
canal.The inflammatory exudation thus excited may close the duct.Not
unfrequently the gall-bladder, full of calculi, is thus shut off from
the liver permanently.In one instance the writer has seen a calculus
wedged into the orifice of the cystic duct, whilst just beyond the
lumen was permanently obstructed by an organized exudation.Permanent
closure of the cystic duct is of far less consequence than of the
common duct, and may, indeed, be a conservative condition, as in the
case above mentioned, where numerous polyangular calculi may have
migrated, except the closure of the passage.The most usual point of obstruction in the course of the common duct is
the intestinal end, but various processes are employed to effect it.The first in importance is catarrhal inflammation.This seems the more
credible when it is remembered that to a simple catarrh of the mucous
membrane is due the temporary stoppage of the duct, producing jaundice
in much the largest proportion of cases.When the epithelium is
detached and granulations spring up from the basement membrane,
adhesions of the surfaces will readily take place, and the union may be
so complete as that all traces of the duct will disappear.It is
probable that in many, if not in most, of these cases the initial
condition of the canal is that of simple catarrh, the more positive
changes in the mucous membrane arising from peculiarities in the
tissues of the individual affected, or from local injury caused by the
passage of a concretion or irritation of pathological secretions of the
duodenum.Stenosis, and finally occlusion, of the common duct may arise from the
cicatrization of an ulcer.They
may result from catarrhal inflammation of a chronic type, much new
connective-tissue material forming, and in the process of
cicatrization, with the contraction belonging to it, the lumen of the
canal is so far filled up that the passage of bile is effectually
prevented.They may be produced in that state of the tissues which
accompanies certain cachectic and profoundly adynamic conditions, as in
severe typhoid fever.Such ulcers may also be due to the mechanical
injury effected by the migration of a gall-stone.In cicatrizing, a
tight stricture, impermeable to the passage of bile, may result, or the
lumen of the canal be entirely obliterated.In the latter case the duct
itself may disappear and leave no trace.An ulcer situated at the
duodenal end of the common duct and extending into the {1084} duodenum
may also in the process of healing so contract as to render the orifice
impermeable to bile.The same effect may follow the cicatrization of an
ulcer of the duodenum in the immediate vicinity of the orifice of the
common duct.Without the intervention of an ulcer as a means of explaining closure
of the common duct, this accident may be caused by a catarrhal
inflammation which effects denudation of the basement membrane, and
thence union may be produced by the mere contact of the
freshly-granulating surfaces.Congenital occlusion of the bile-ducts or
obstruction occurring in a few days after birth, it is probable, is
effected in this way, but no direct evidence of the process has thus
far been offered.During intra-uterine life, as at any period in
after-life, it seems necessary to the production of such changes that a
peculiar constitutional state must exist; otherwise, such a result
might happen to every case of catarrhal inflammation of the bile-ducts.The extent of the changes is further evidence in the same direction;
for not only are the walls of the duct in permanent apposition and
adhesion, but the duct degenerates into a mere fibrous cord, and in
some instances is nearly, even entirely, obliterated.[189]

[Footnote 189: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.The cystic or common duct--the latter to be chiefly considered--may be
occluded by the retention in its lumen of some foreign body.The
impaction of a biliary calculus has already been repeatedly referred
to, but there are some additional points demanding consideration.The
larger concretions may be stopped in the neck of the gall-bladder;
those small enough to enter the canal may be arrested at its bend
behind the neck, and the very entrance of the cystic duct may be
blocked, as in a case examined by the writer.The hepatic duct is very rarely permanently occluded.As the calibre of
this canal continuously enlarges downward, there is no point at which a
stone is likely to be arrested; nevertheless, it occasionally happens
that such an obstruction does occur.An example has occurred under the
observation of the writer, but the cause was a gunshot wound of the
liver.The most usual, and for very obvious reasons the most important, of the
sites where occlusion occurs is the common duct and at the termination
of the duct in the small intestine, the intestinal orifice.Just behind
and to the right of its orifice the duct is dilated into a fossa--the
diverticulum Vateri; and here concretions of a size to pass along the
common duct are stopped.It is not essential that the stone fit the
canal: it may do so and prevent any bile passing into the duodenum; it
may be a polyangular body, and, though wedged in, leave spaces through
which more or less can slowly trickle.Again, the diverticulum may contain numerous concretions,
which distend the canal greatly, but through the interstices of which
some bile can flow.Other foreign bodies very rarely close the intestinal end of the ductus
communis; thus, for example, a cherry-seed, a plum-seed, a mass of
raisin-seeds, may slip into the orifice after the passage of a
gall-stone has stretched it sufficiently.A much more common cause of
occlusion is an intestinal parasite, which crawls in and is fastened.The common round-worm is the most frequent offender, and much less
often liver-flukes find a lodgment there.{1085} The ductus communis choledochus may be closed by agencies acting
from without.They are various, but the most common are the
carcinomata.Primary cancer of the gall-bladder and gall-ducts,
although not of frequent occurrence, is by no means rare.It develops
in connection with the connective-tissue new formations produced by the
inflammation following the migration of large calculi.A very
instructive example has been examined by the writer.The patient, a
woman aged forty-eight, had had numerous paroxysms of hepatic colic,
and after death, which followed a protracted stage of jaundice by
obstruction, a large ovoid calculus, filling the gall-bladder, was
found, and an extensive organized exudation of inflammatory origin was
the seat of carcinomatous disease involving the cystic and common ducts
and closing the lumen of both.Cancer of the pylorus, of the duodenum,
of the pancreas, of the right kidney, and of the liver itself, not
unfrequently by exterior pressure permanently occlude the common duct.To this category of obstructing causes must be added enlarged lymphatic
glands of the transverse fissure, large fecal accumulations, tumors of
the ovaries and uterus, aneurisms of the abdominal aorta, and
especially aneurism of the hepatic artery, several examples of which
have been reported, and one has occurred in a case seen by the writer.The effects of obstruction are much less important when the cystic duct
is closed.The contents of the gall-bladder accumulate, constituting
the condition known as dropsy of the gall-bladder.A catarrhal state of
the mucous membrane is set up; the muco-pus formed mixes with the bile,
and the mixture undergoes fermentative changes which further alter its
character and impart to it irritating qualities, in consequence of
which the mucous membrane becomes more decidedly inflamed, and a still
more purulent fluid forms, so that ultimately the contents of the
gall-bladder are entirely purulent, and that organ may attain to
enormous size.Instead of a catarrhal inflammation leading to
suppuration, the mucous membrane may pour out serum abundantly, the
biliary contents and mucus disappear by absorption, and finally the
gall-bladder will be moderately distended by a serous-like fluid.No
further disturbance ensues, and the gall-bladder, thus shut off from
participation in the hepatic functions, ceases to give trouble.The results are far different when the obstruction occurs in the
hepatic or common duct, for then the bile can no longer perform its
double function of secretion and excretion--of contributing materials
necessary to digestion and assimilation, and excreting substances whose
removal is necessary to health.The liver continuing to functionate
after closure of the duct is effected, obviously the secretion of bile
continues to accumulate, and the irritation of the mucous membrane
causes a catarrhal state; mucus is poured out, and serum escapes from
the distended vessels.If the hepatic duct only is obstructed, the
dilatation will not involve the cystic duct and gall-bladder, but as
the common duct at its termination is occluded, usually the whole
system of tubes will be affected by the ensuing changes.The
alterations already described as occurring in the gall-bladder take
place in all the hepatic ducts.The bile-elements are absorbed, and the
fluid distending the whole system of hepatic tubes becomes finally a
semi-transparent serum or a very thin sero-mucus, having in bulk a pale
sea-green color.Although an intense jaundice {1086} coexists with the
obstruction, no portion of the bile escapes into the ducts.At the
beginning of the obstruction more or less bile is in the tubes, and
then the fluid will have a distinct biliary character; but as it
accumulates, first the bile-constituents disappear, then the
mucus--which at the outset was formed freely--is absorbed, and at last
only a colorless serum remains.This fluid, which has been examined
chemically by Frerichs, is found to be slightly alkaline, to have only
2 per cent.of solids, and to present no trace of any biliary
constituent.As the fluid accumulates the gall-bladder and ducts
dilate, sometimes to an enormous extent, the fluid they contain
amounting to several pints.The walls of the ducts grow thinner, and
may finally give way with the pressure or from external violence, the
fluid exciting an intense and quickly-fatal peritonitis.Important
changes occur in the structure of the liver also.With the first
retention of bile the liver conspicuously enlarges, and may indeed
attain to twice its normal size, but it subsequently contracts, and may
lessen in as great a degree as it had enlarged.Changes begin in the
glandular structure as pressure is brought to bear on the cells by the
enlarging ducts.The liver-cells become anaemic and the protoplasm
cloudy, but granular and fatty degeneration does not take place.Even
more important as an agency affecting the condition of the hepatic
cells is the hyperplasia of the connective tissue, which ensues very
promptly when an obstruction to the flow of bile arises from any cause,
as has been shown by Legg[190] and Charcot.[191] The liver on section
has a rather dark olive-green color, and is firmer in texture, owing to
the increased development of the connective tissue; the cells are
bile-stained and contain granules of coloring matter and crystals of
bilirubin, and although they are at first not altered in outline,
subsequently more or less atrophy is produced by the contraction of the
newly-formed connective tissue and the pressure made by the dilated
hepatic ducts.[Footnote 190: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.352
_et seq._]

[Footnote 191: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.205 _et
seq._]

SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms produced by occlusion of the cystic duct are
not sufficiently characteristic to be diagnosticated with any
certainty.When an attack of hepatic colic has slowly subsided without
jaundice, and an elastic tumor, globular or pyriform in shape, has
appeared from under the inferior margin of the liver in the position of
the gall-bladder, dropsy of that organ may then be suspected.As
paracentesis of the gall-bladder may be performed with ease, safety,
and little pain, the diagnosis may be rendered more certain by the use
of the exploring-trocar.Obstruction of the hepatic or common duct is accompanied by symptoms of
a very pronounced and distinctly diagnostic character.Without
referring now to the antecedent symptoms or to those belonging to the
obstructing cause, the complexus of disturbances following the
obstruction is the subject to which our attention must be directed.The
great fact dominating all other considerations is the stoppage of the
bile, whether this has occurred suddenly or slowly.Jaundice begins in
a few hours after the canal is blocked.At first there is yellowness of
the conjunctiva, then diffused jaundice, deepening into the intensest
color in two or three weeks, or, when the obstruction is sudden and
complete, in a few hours.At first the color is the vivid jaundice
tint, a citron or salmon or yellow-saffron hue, but this gradually
loses its bright appearance, grows darker, and passes successively into
a brownish, bronze-like, and ultimately a {1087} dark olive-green,
which becomes the permanent color.Under some moral emotional
influences there may be a sudden change to a brighter tint, lasting a
few minutes, but otherwise the general dark olive-green hue persists
throughout.In a few instances, after some weeks of jaundice, the
abnormal coloration entirely disappears, signifying that the liver is
too much damaged in its proper glandular structure to be in a condition
to produce bile.Such a cessation of the jaundice is therefore of evil
omen.Pruritus, sometimes of a very intense character, accompanies the
jaundice, in most cases appears with it, and in the supposed curable
cases it has persisted after the cessation of the discoloration.The
irritation may become intolerable, destroying all comfort, rendering
sleep impossible, and so aggravating as to induce a highly nervous,
hysterical state.The scratching sets up an inflammation of the skin,
and presently a troublesome eczema is superadded.In some of the cases
a peculiar eruption occurs on the skin and mucous membranes, entitled
by Wilson[192] xanthelasma.It has been carefully studied by Wickham
Legg,[193] who has ascertained the character of the changes occurring
in the affected tissues, and also by Mr.[194] As a rule,
this eruption appears after several months of jaundice, and manifests
itself first on the eyelids, then on the palms of the hands, where it
makes the most characteristic exhibit, and after a time on the lips and
tongue.It occurs in irregular plaques of a yellowish tint slightly
elevated above the general surface, and rarely assumes a tubercular
form.As was shown by Hilton Fagge, xanthelasma occurs more especially
in the milder cases of catarrhal icterus that had been protracted in
duration, but it is also occasionally seen in the jaundice of
obstruction.[Footnote 192: _Diseases of the Skin_, 6th ed., Lond., p.[Footnote 193: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.317
_et seq._]

[Footnote 194: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.According to the stage of the disease during which the examination is
made the liver will be enlarged or contracted; more or less tenderness
may be developed by pressure in the area occupied by the ducts, and a
tumor in a position to effect compression may possibly be detected.The
area of hepatic dulness will be increased in the beginning of all the
cases in which the obstruction is complete, but will remain normal so
long as the flow of bile persists despite the obstruction.When
enlarged, the liver can be felt projecting below the inferior margin of
the ribs, and with it, in most cases, the elastic globular body, the
gall-bladder.The state of the hepatic secretion, and in consequence
the duration of the obstruction, may be ascertained by puncture of the
gall-bladder and withdrawal of some of its contents for examination.The presence of unaltered bile will indicate recent obstruction; of
serum, will prove long-standing interruption of bile-production.The
presence of concretions in the gall-bladder will indicate the character
of the obstructing cause, and an increased amount of bile of a normal
or nearly normal kind will be conclusive evidence that the obstruction
is in the course of the common duct.In a fatal case of permanent
occlusion examined by myself the cystic duct was closed by inflammatory
adhesions and the common duct was stopped up by a calculus.The enlarged area of hepatic dulness will, in a protracted case, not
continue.The proper secreting structure, the hepatic cells, undergo
atrophy, {1088} and the increased connective tissue--to the development
of which enlargement of the organ is mainly due--contracts.The
ultimate result is that the liver becomes sclerosed, and is distinctly
smaller, the area of hepatic dulness diminishing to a greater relative
extent than the area of dulness due to hypertrophic enlargement.The
contraction of the liver goes on at the rate that several months are
required to make the result evident on percussion and palpation.Not
unfrequently, the contraction is too slight to affect the percussion
note of the right hypochondrium, and then, to realize the condition of
the organ, the history and rational signs must be closely studied.Whilst the liver thus varies in size, the gall-bladder remains enlarged
and projects from the under surface of the organ, elastic, globular,
and distinctive.The shrinking of the liver from around it makes the
impression of growing size; it may be increasing, indeed, but more
frequently the enlargement is merely apparent.Whether the liver be enlarging or diminishing in size, its functions
are impaired, or indeed entirely suspended.As the digestive canal
receives the bile immediately on its production, it will be best to
begin with the gastro-intestinal disorders which accompany occlusion of
the bile-ducts.The appetite is either wanting entirely and food is
loathed, or an excessive or canine appetite is experienced.The latter
belongs rather to an early stage of the disorder, and comes on after
the first disturbance of the stomach belonging to the immediate effects
of the occlusion.The former is the result of long-standing
interference with the primary assimilation.The tongue is coated with a
thick yellowish fur, which, drying, is detached in flakes, leaving the
mucous membrane beneath red, raw, fissured, and easily bleeding.The
taste is bitter, and the mouth has a pasty, greasy, and unclean
feeling.There is much thirst, and as a rule the patient experiences a
keen desire for acid drinks and for fresh fruits.The stomach is rather
intolerant of food, and nausea comes on as soon as it enters the
stomach.The mucus and stomach-juice accumulating over night, in the
morning there is much retching and nausea until the acid and rather
foul contents of the organ come up.When food is retained it causes
much distress, gases of decomposition accumulate, distending the
stomach and giving prominence to the epigastrium, and eructations of
offensive gas, with some acid liquid, occur from time to time.Similarly, in the intestines the foods undergo decomposition instead of
normal digestion; gases of putrefaction are evolved, the abdomen
generally is swollen, and flatulent colic results.Very irritating fat
acids are liberated by the decomposition of the fatty constituents of
the food, which, with the acid products of the fermentation occurring
in the starch and sugar of the diet, cause a sensation of heat and
distress through the abdomen.Usually, the bowels are torpid, but in
some cases the stools are relaxed, having the consistence and
presenting somewhat the appearance of oatmeal porridge.They may be
firm, moulded, even hard.The gas discharged and the stools are
offensive, with a carrion-like odor.Sometimes decomposing articles of
food can be detected in the stools by very casual inspection--always,
indeed, when the examination is intimate.An excess of fat is also a
characteristic of the condition induced by occlusion of the ducts,
especially when the pancreatic duct is closed, as does happen in cancer
of the head of the pancreas.{1089} A significant change in the color of the stools takes place.They lose their normal brownish-red tint and become yellowish or
clay- or white, pasty, or grayish.Sometimes the stools are very
dark, tar-like in color and consistence, or more thin like prune-juice,
or in black scybalae.The most usual appearance of the stools in
occlusion is grayish, mush-like, and coarsely granular.The very dark
hue assumed at times or in some cases signifies the presence of blood.A dark tint of the evacuations may be caused by articles of food, as a
greenish hue may be due to the use of spinach; a clay- tint to
the almost exclusive use of milk; a grayish tint to the action of
bismuth; a bilious appearance to the action of rhubarb; and many
others.When the occlusion is partial, although it be permanent,
sufficient bile may descend into the duodenum to color the stools to
the normal tint, and yet all the other signs of obstruction be present.The bile-pigment, not having an outlet by the natural route, by the
intestine, passes into the blood; all the tissues of the body and the
various secretions and excretions, notably the urine, are stained by
it, constituting the appearance known as jaundice or icterus.This
malady has been described (see ante), but it is necessary now to give a
more specialized account of those conditions due more especially to the
prolonged obstruction of the biliary flow.These are a morbid state of
the blood; changes in the kidneys and in the composition of the urine;
a peculiar form of fever known as hepatic intermittent fever; and a
group of nervous symptoms to which has been applied the term cholaemia.It has already been shown that but little pressure is required to
divert the flow of bile from the ducts backward into the blood.Changes
consequently ensue in the constitution of the blood and in the action
of the heart and of the vessels.The bile acids lower the heart's
movements and lessen the arterial tension; hence the pulse is slower,
softer, and feebler than the normal.Should fever arise, this
depressing action of the bile acids is maintained; and hence, although
the temperature becomes elevated, the pulse-rate does not increase
correspondingly.There are exceptions to this, however, in so far that
the heart and arteries are in some instances little affected, but it is
probable under these circumstances that there are conditions present
which induce decomposition of the bile acids.The most important result of the action of the bile on the constitution
of the blood is the hemorrhagic diathesis.Soon after the occlusion
occurs in very young subjects--at a later period in adults--the
occlusion having existed for many months, in some cases only near the
end, the disposition to hemorrhagic extravasations and to hemorrhages
manifests itself.From the surface of the mucous membranes, under the
serous, in the substance of muscles, the hemorrhages occur.Epistaxis,
or nasal hemorrhage, is usually the first to appear, and may be the
most difficult to arrest.The gums transude blood, and wherever
pressure is brought to bear on the integument ecchymoses follow.The
conjunctiva may be disfigured and the eyelids swollen and blackened by
extravasations, and the skin of the cheeks and nose marked by stigmata.Haematemesis sometimes occurs, but the extravasations into the
intestinal canal more frequently--indeed, very constantly--take place
in a gradual manner, and impart to the stools a dark, almost black,
tar-like appearance.In the same way the urine may contain fluid blood
and coagula, or it may have a merely smoky {1090} appearance from
intimate admixture with the blood at the moment of secretion.Both the bile-pigment and bile acids exert an injurious action on the
kidneys.In cases of prolonged obstruction not only are the tissues of
the organ stained by pigment in common with the tissues of the body,
but the epithelium of the tubules, of the straight and convoluted
tubes, are, according to Moebius,[195] infiltrated with pigment.In
consequence of the size and number of the masses of pigment, the tubes
may become obstructed and the secretion of urine much diminished.Other
changes occur, due chiefly to the action of the bile acids, according
to the same authority.These alterations consist in parenchymatous
degeneration.The urine contains traces of albumen in most cases, and,
according to Nothnagel,[196] always casts of the hyaline and granular
varieties stained with pigment.As the alterations in the structure of
the kidneys progress, fatty epithelium is cast off, and thus the
tubules come finally to be much obstructed and the function of the
organ seriously impaired.To cholaemia then are superadded the peculiar
disturbances belonging to retention of the urinary constituents.[Footnote 195: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, vol.[Footnote 196: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.326;
also, Harley, _op.One of the most interesting complications which arises during the
existence of obstruction of the bile-ducts is the form of fever
entitled by Charcot[197] intermittent hepatic fever.Although its
character was first indicated by Monneret,[198] we owe the present
conception of its nature and its more accurate clinical history to
Charcot.As has already been pointed
out, the passage of a gall-stone may develop a latent malarial
infection or a febrile movement comparable to that caused by the
passage of a catheter, and known as urethral fever.Charcot supposes
that true intermittent hepatic fever is septicaemic in character, and
can therefore arise only in those cases accompanied by an angiocholitis
of the suppurative variety--such, for example, as that which follows
the passage of calculi.Illustrative cases of this fever, one of them
confirmed by an autopsy, have been recently reported by E. Wagner,[199]
who is rather inclined to accept Charcot's view of the pathogeny.A
remarkable case has been published by Regnard,[200] in which the
angiocholitis was induced by the extension of echinococcus cysts into
the common duct.Whilst there are some objections to Charcot's theory,
on the whole it is probably true that this intermittent hepatic fever
is produced by the absorption from the inflamed surface of the ducts of
a noxious material there produced.It may be likened to the fever which
can be caused by the injection of putrid pus into the veins of animals.[Footnote 197: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.178 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 198: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 199: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.[Footnote 200: _Gazette med.49, 1873, quoted by Wagner,
_supra_.]Intermittent hepatic fever, as its name implies, is a paroxysmal fever,
having a striking resemblance to malarial fever, but differs from it in
less regularity of recurrence, in the fact that urea is below the
normal amount instead of increased, and in the effect of quinine, which
in the case of malarial fever is curative, but not curative in hepatic
fever.The paroxysms are sometimes quotidian, rarely double quotidian,
tertian, quartan, and even longer, and in the same case all of these
varieties may occur; on {1091} the other hand, there may be entire
regularity of the seizures.The severity of the chill, the maximum
temperature, and the amount of sweating vary within considerable
limits; there may be merely a slight sense of chilliness or a severe
rigor; the temperature may rise to 101 degrees or to 104 degrees F.,
and there may be a gentle moisture or a profuse sweat.There does not
seem to be any relation between the extent and severity of the local
mischief and the systemic condition.The period of onset of intermittent hepatic fever, and its duration and
mode of termination, are by no means readily determined.Cyr fixes on
the paroxysms of colic as the beginning, but he obviously confounds the
chill and fever caused by the passage of a calculus with the true
intermittent hepatic fever.In a carefully-observed case, the facts
confirmed by an autopsy, E. Wagner[201] gives the clinical history of a
typical example of this malady: Gall-stones were found in the duodenum,
in the common and cystic ducts, but the most important one was a
polyangular stone obstructing the hepatic duct.There was an ulcer with
thickened margin at the entrance to the gall-bladder, and the mucous
membrane of the common duct near the intestinal orifice had a smooth,
cicatricial aspect of recent origin, indicating inflammatory
ulceration.The conditions favorable to the production of a morbid
material of a kind to induce septicaemic fever were therefore present.The onset of fever occurred ten days after the last seizure, time being
thus afforded for the local changes necessary.The duration of the
fever in this case was five months, but the existence of pulmonary
phthisis with cavities will explain this apparently protracted hepatic
intermittent fever.The duration of the disease in its usual form is
uncertain, and ranges between a week and two months, or even three
months, according to Charcot.[202]

[Footnote 201: _Deutsches Archiv fur klinische Medicin_, Band xxxiv.[Footnote 202: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, p.Suspension of work by the liver necessarily involves retention in the
blood of various excrementitious matters.The attempt of Flint[203] to
establish the doctrine of cholesteraemia has not been supported by the
evidence of contemporary or subsequent physiologists.This theory
denies to the other constituents of the bile any morbific action, and
concentrates those disturbances known as cholaemia on the effects of
cholesterin.As uraemia signifies not merely the presence of urea in
the blood, but of all of the toxic substances excreted by the kidneys,
so the word cholaemia comprehends all the constituents of bile having
power to derange the organism by their presence in the blood.[Footnote 203: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, 1862, p.349 _et seq._]

By cholaemia is meant those disturbances, chiefly nervous, which are
due to the presence of biliary excrementitious matters in the blood,
and not less to the effect on nutrition of the absence of bile from the
process of digestion in the intestine.As the atrophic changes proceed
in the liver, the quantity of urea and uric acid in the urine
diminishes, and presently leucin and tyrosin appear.Amongst the means
of differential diagnosis of hepatic intermittent fever from malarial
fever Charcot mentions the quantity of urea present--in the former
greatly lessened, in the latter much increased.There is, however, a
source of fallacy here not mentioned by Charcot: that is, the
variations in the amount of urea due to destruction of the hepatic
secreting structure.It follows that as changes {1092} occur in the
kidneys, to the condition of cholaemia is superadded the derangements
belonging to uraemia.When the occlusion has existed for some time--a variable period, partly
due to peculiarities of individual structure--there come on certain
characteristic symptoms of nervous origin: headache, hebetude of mind,
dull hearing, obscure or hazy vision, xanthopsia; somnolence and
greatly increasing stupor, leading into coma; rambling and incoherence
of mind, passing into delirium; muscular twitching, subsultus; muscular
weakness, deepening into paralysis; and finally, it may be, general
convulsions.As these derangements of the nervous system develop, a
light febrile movement supervenes, so that the whole complexus has the
typhoid type, or, as it can be more definitely expressed, the patient
thus affected lapses into the typhoid state.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Occlusion of the gall-ducts is an
essentially chronic malady in the greatest number of cases.As a rule,
the causes of obstruction operate slowly, but to this rule there are
exceptions.Permanent occlusion may take place suddenly, as when a
gall-stone is impacted immovably in the common duct, or when a
round-worm makes its way into the duct and is firmly fixed there,
incapable of further movement.When occlusion is once effected the gradual changes occurring in the
liver lead to slow decline of the nutrition; the bile-elements
circulating in the blood poison it and set up alterations in the
structure of the kidney, and ultimately, the brain becoming affected,
the end is reached by convulsions and coma.Although permanent
occlusion, if unrelieved, terminates in death, a small proportion of
cases get well, either in consequence of giving way of the obstructing
cause or from the opening of a new route to the intestine.Thus, a
calculus lodged in the fossa of Vater may suffer such injury to its
outer shell as to yield to the action of solvents, or, suppuration
occurring around it, the stone may be loosened and forced onward, or
ulceration may open a channel into the bowel.An incurable malady
causing the occlusion, the termination in death is only a question of
time.There are several
factors, however, whose value can be approximately estimated.When the
obstructing cause is merely local--as, for example, a gall-stone or the
cicatrix of a simple ulcer--the duration of the case is determined by
the mere effect of the suspension of the hepatic functions.As the
eliminating action of the liver and the part played by the bile in the
intestinal digestion are necessary to life, it follows that the
complete cessation of these functions must lead to death.The rate at
which decline takes place under these circumstances varies somewhat in
different subjects.Probably two years may be regarded as the maximum,
and three months the minimum, period at which death ensues when no
other pathogenetic factor intervenes.DIAGNOSIS.--To determine the fact of occlusion is by no means
difficult: the persistent jaundice, the absence of bile in the stools,
and the appearance of the bile-elements in the urine are sufficient.It
is far different when the cause of the occlusion is to be ascertained.The ease and safety with which the exploring-trocar can be used in
cases of supposed obstruction of the cystic duct enable the physician
to decide with confidence points which before could only be matters of
mere {1093} conjecture.The writer of these lines was the first to
puncture the gall-bladder and to explore, by means of a flexible probe
passed through the canula, the course of the duct.[204] It is possible
in this way to ascertain the existence of gall-stones in the
gall-bladder, to find an obstruction at the entrance of the cystic
duct, to demonstrate the presence of echinococci cysts, and to remove
for microscopical examination pathological fluids of various kinds.More recently, Whittaker and Ransohoff[205] of Cincinnati have
attempted the detection of a gall-stone impacted at any point by the
introduction of an exploring-needle; and this practice has been
imitated by Harley[206] of London, but without any reference to the
pioneer and prior investigation of his American colleagues.The case of
Whittaker and Ransohoff survived the exploratory puncture, but Harley's
case proved fatal from traumatic peritonitis.Notwithstanding this
untoward result, Harley persists in the advocacy of this method.It
must appear to any one familiar with the intricate arrangement of the
parts composing the anatomy of this region a most hazardous proceeding,
and hardly to be justified in view of the superior safety and certainty
of my method.To explore the interior of the gall-bladder an
aspirator-trocar is introduced; any fluid intended for microscopical
examination is then withdrawn, and through the canula a flexible
whalebone bougie is passed.[Footnote 204: _The Cincinnati Lancet and Clinic_ for 1878-79; also, W.
W. Keen, M.D., "On Cholecystotomy," _The Medical News_, Sept., 1884.][Footnote 205: _Lancet and Clinic_, 1884.][Footnote 206: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1884.]When icterus comes on in a few days after birth and persists until
death ensues by convulsions and coma, there can be no doubt regarding
congenital absence or impermeability of the common duct.Permanent
retention-jaundice, accompanied by the characteristic symptoms of that
condition immediately succeeding an attack of hepatic colic, is
probably due to impaction by a calculus.When, at or after middle life,
in a patient with a history of former attacks due to gall-stones, there
begins a fixed pain in the right hypochondrium, and subsequently
retention-jaundice, the existence of a malignant growth in connection
with the cicatricial tissue and ancient organized exudation should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if subsequently a tumor
can be felt.If with a localized pain slowly-developing jaundice,
intestinal indigestion, fats and oils appearing unchanged in the
stools, and a condition of prostration more than is properly referable
to the derangement of the hepatic functions, come on in a man or woman
after thirty-five, cancer of the head of the pancreas should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if a tumor can be
detected in that situation.It should not be forgotten, however, that
in emaciated subjects the head of the pancreas may be so prominent as
to be mistaken for a scirrhous growth.A pulsating tumor of the right hypochondrium, accompanied by jaundice,
may be an aneurism of the hepatic artery.Pulsation may be communicated
to a bunch of enlarged portal lymphatic glands, which will compress the
common duct, but in this case, as the increase in the size of the
glands is due to caseous, amyloid, or cancerous deposits, there will be
found a source whence these morbid products are derived, and will
explain the nature of a tumor thus constituted.The differentiation of hypertrophic cirrhosis from occlusion of a
slowly-forming character is by no means easy.In both jaundice {1094}
gradually appears; in both the liver is enlarged, but in hypertrophic
cirrhosis much more than in occlusion; and in the latter the
gall-bladder is full--may indeed be distended--whilst in the former it
is empty or contains but little bile.The history of the case may
indicate the nature of the symptoms.Previous attacks of hepatic colic,
and the symptoms of occlusion supervening on the last, are highly
significant of calculous occlusion.TREATMENT.--To ascertain the nature of the occlusion is a necessary
preliminary to any exact treatment.In many cases this must remain a
mere conjecture, when, of course, the treatment is only symptomatic.When it is probable or certain that the duct is obstructed by a
calculus, two methods may be resorted to for its removal: one method is
to break up the calculus by mechanical means; the other is to effect
its solution by chemical agents.Fracture of an impacted calculus is not a merely fanciful expedient.If
the site of the obstruction is ascertained, an attempt may be made to
penetrate the calculus by an aspirator-needle passed through the
abdominal walls, according to the method of Whittaker and Ransohoff.The dangers attendant on this mere puncture are great, and a fatal
result has occurred in one of the very few cases in which it has been
done.Less severe and dangerous methods for attempting the
disintegration of a calculus should be first tried, as follows: Make
firm friction with the fingers along the inferior margin of the ribs
and toward the epigastrium and umbilicus, whilst the opposite side
posteriorly is supported by the hand spread out and applied firmly.A
strong faradic current sent through the region of the gall-bladder and
ducts has in several instances seemed to do good--indeed, to remove
obstructions.A calculus impacted may be dislodged either by the
fracture of its surfaces or by the strong muscular contractions of the
abdominal walls and of the muscular layer of the duct.Most calculi are
easily broken, and when the smallest breach is made in the external
crust disintegration follows; and some calculi are so friable as to
yield to slight pressure.Furthermore, the slightest solution in the
continuity of the rind disposes the whole mass to dissolve in suitable
menstrua.Mechanical rupture is so important a step in the process of
disintegration of an impacted calculus that so serious an operation as
section of the abdomen as a preliminary to it should be considered.The
cavity exposed, the obstructed duct is found, and its retained calculus
is mashed without section of the duct.I find one instance[207] in
which this was done as a subordinate part of a cholecystotomy, and the
breaking up of the stone proved to be easy of accomplishment.It is
also the method of Tait, who proposes to mash the calculus by means of
suitable forceps fitted with padded blades.[Footnote 207: Harley's case, _op.cit._]

I have suggested a means of effecting solution of an impacted calculus
which seems, on further reflection, well worthy of consideration.The
proposal is to inject, through a canula introduced into the
gall-bladder, one of the solvents of the cholesterin calculus before
mentioned.I have already used the canula as a duct for the passage of
an exploring-sound, and have by means of it explored the interior of
the gall-bladder.It is quite as feasible to inject through the canula
a solvent, successive charges of which can be thrown in and withdrawn
by the aspirator.{1095} That the usual solvents introduced by the stomach can effect the
solution of impacted calculi has been declared impossible by
Trousseau;[208] and with this conclusion I unhesitatingly agree.I have
already discussed this part of the subject, and need now only refer the
reader to that section.[Footnote 208: _Clinique medicale_, _loc.cit._]

The various causes of obstruction besides calculi do not offer an
inviting field for the exercise of therapeutical skill.Each case must
be treated according to the nature of the obstructing cause; hence to
make an accurate diagnosis is an essential preliminary to suitable
treatment.DISEASES OF THE PORTAL VEIN.Thrombosis and Embolism of the Portal Vein; Stenosis; Pylephlebitis.DEFINITION.--By the terms at the head of this section are meant the
various pathological processes which induce coagulation of the blood in
some part of the portal system.As the portal vein is made up of many
branches coming from the various organs of the abdominal cavity except
the kidneys, and as it empties, so to speak, into the liver, it is
obvious that various and complex derangements will ensue on the
formation of thrombi.CAUSES.--Thrombosis of the portal vein occurs under three general
conditions: the blood is in a readily coagulable state; the action of
the heart is weak and the blood-current sluggish; the circulation
through the vein is impeded by external pressure.The coagulability of
the blood is increased in diseases characterized by an excess of its
fibrin-producing constituents, of which cirrhosis of the liver may be
mentioned as one having this peculiarity.In chronic maladies of a
depressing kind there may be simply a weak action of the heart, or the
muscular tissue of the organ may be affected by a fatty and atrophic
degeneration.The external pressure by which the blood-current through
the vein is impeded may be caused by the newly-formed connective tissue
of Glisson's capsule, by enlarged lymphatics in the hilus of the liver,
or by tumors of various kinds.The first named of these causes of
compression--atrophic cirrhosis--is most frequently acting.Very
rarely, organized exudations of the peritoneum may be so situated as to
compress the portal vein.This result can only happen when the hepatic
portion of the peritoneum is involved.Pylephlebitis exists in two forms: the adhesive and suppurative.The
former results in changes not unlike those of simple thrombosis.The
blood coagulates in the affected part of the vessel, the clot is
organized, and the vessel ultimately forms a solid rounded cord which
is permanently occluded.The suppurative variety is so different in its
origin and in its results that it requires separate treatment, and I
therefore postpone the consideration of it to the next section.{1096} SYMPTOMS OF THROMBOSIS AND ADHESIVE PYLEPHLEBITIS.--It is a
remarkable fact that the biliary function of the liver is not
necessarily affected in cases of occlusion of the portal vein.It is
true, in advanced cases of cirrhosis, when the interlobular veins are
obliterated by the pressure of the contracting newly-formed connective
tissue, the functions of the liver are arrested in so far as the damage
thus caused extends.Notwithstanding the blocking of the portal,
sufficient blood reaches the hepatic cells by the anastomosis between
the hepatic artery and the interlobular veins--an anatomical connection
demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten.[209] So long as this anastomosis
continues bile will be formed, although the portal vein is occluded.[Footnote 209: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxvii.153, "Ueber
Circulationsstorungen in der Leber."]The most significant symptoms of thrombosis of the portal vein are the
sudden formation of ascites, which quickly assumes a very high grade,
and equally sudden passive congestion of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, enlargement of the spleen, and distension of the superficial
veins of the abdominal parietes.When these symptoms succeed to
cirrhosis of the liver, or appear after the formation of a tumor in the
hepatic region, or come on in the course of phthisis or chronic
inflammation of the hepatic peritoneum, the existence of thrombus of
the portal vein may be reasonably suspected.Coincidently with the occlusion of the portal vein the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane becomes the seat of a catarrhal
process, and to the fluid thus produced is added a much more abundant
transudation from the distended capillaries.Nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea result, the rejected matters being serous, watery, and in
many cases tinged with blood.Now and then quite a severe hemorrhage
takes place, and the blood is brought up by vomiting (haematemesis) or
is discharged by stool.Hemorrhoids form, and, in large masses
protruding, much pain is experienced, and free bleeding may result from
rupture of a distended vein.The veins of the abdominal parietes, which in the normal state are
invisible or at least not prominent, and which form anastomoses with
the portal, when the obstruction occurs dilate, sometimes to a
remarkable extent.The most important anastomosis is that between the
femoral and saphena and internal mammary and epigastric veins.When the
hepatic branches of the portal are closed, but the trunk remains
pervious, the parumbilical vein enlarges greatly, and, communicating
with the superficial veins of the anterior part of the abdominal walls,
forms a radiating network of tortuous veins to which is given the
striking title of caput Medusae.The most significant symptom of portal thrombosis is a quickly-forming
ascites.It is true, ascites is a common symptom in advanced cirrhosis,
but the rapid accumulation of fluid and the prompt filling of the
cavity after tapping distinguish that which arises from portal
thrombosis from all others.Besides its excessive extent, the ascites
presents the usual symptoms.Due to the same cause as the enlargement of the superficial veins, the
hemorrhages, the ascites, etc., there occurs considerable hypertrophy
of the spleen in many of the cases.It sometimes happens that the new
compensatory circulation and the hemorrhages from some part in the
{1097} usual route of the portal so dispose of the blood that the
spleen does not enlarge sufficiently to be readily made out.COURSE AND TERMINATION.--It is obvious that a condition such as that
induced by thrombosis of the portal must be comparatively quickly
fatal; but the cases vary in duration as the compensatory circulation
is more or less complete.Whilst the majority of cases terminate within
two weeks, instances of several months' duration are not unknown, but a
fatal termination, sooner or later, is inevitable in all cases.Coming on in the course of some chronic affection of the liver or some
obstructing cause exterior to the organ, there soon follow ascites,
nausea and vomiting, haematemesis, bloody stools of a liquid character,
enlargement of the spleen, distension of the abdominal veins, and the
distressing symptoms produced by an excessive accumulation of fluid in
the peritoneal cavity.DIAGNOSIS.--As there is no symptom of thrombosis of the portal which
may not be caused by advanced cirrhosis, the diagnosis rests on the
rapid production of the attendant phenomena and their conjoint
appearance.TREATMENT.--A symptomatic treatment is alone possible.The highly
irritable and congested intestinal mucous membrane precludes the
employment of hydragogue cathartics.Salines which cause outward
diffusion from the vessels are the only cathartics which can be used
with propriety.Action of the kidneys and of the skin must be
maintained.To this end the resin of copaiba in pilular form and
pilocarpine subcutaneously may be used.If the strength of the patient
will permit, leeches around the anus can be applied, and much relief
may be expected from free bleeding.It is probable that opening a
swollen hemorrhoid would give the same kind of relief as that caused by
a free hemorrhage.In any case the benefit derived from treatment must
be merely palliative and temporary.Suppurative Pylephlebitis.PATHOGENY.--Primary pylephlebitis rarely if ever occurs.On the other
hand, the secondary form is by no means uncommon; it succeeds to
ulcerative or purulent inflammation at some point in the circuit of
origin of the portal radicles.The most frequently-occurring cause is
ulceration and suppuration of some part of the intestinal tube, and
hence the most common result is multiple abscess of the liver.Pylephlebitis has often resulted from typhlitis; from ulcers of the
large intestine, as in dysentery; from such traumatic injuries as tying
hemorrhoids; from proctitis; from ulcers of the stomach and similar
morbid processes elsewhere within the range of origin of the portal
system.The inflammatory or ulcerative action
extends to and involves the walls of the veins, or some morbid material
diffuses through the vein walls.In either case coagulation of the
blood in the vessel ensues, and the clot undergoes a series of changes
resulting in the formation of emboli, which, carried into the main
current, are subsequently lodged in the hepatic capillaries.There are three steps in the morbid process: the changes in the vein
wall; the production and transformation of the thrombus; and the
formation of secondary suppurating foci in the liver.{1098} The appearance of the tunics of the inflamed vessels varies with
the stage at which they are examined.At first the walls of the vessels
are reddish from congestion, succulent, and swollen, infiltrated by
leucocytes and inflammatory exudation and the cellular elements
undergoing proliferation.The intima especially is much altered in its
appearance and structure, becoming thick, opaque, grayish or yellowish
in color, and having adherent to it a thrombus passing through its
characteristic changes.Ulceration of the intima then occurs, and the
purulent elements, with shreds of tissue, mingle with the degenerating
blood-clot, and ultimately there remains a purulent depot lined with
sloughing, even gangrenous, contents.Emboli detached from such
decomposing thrombus are arrested in the vessels of the liver, and
there set up a suppurating phlebitis, ending in an abscess formation,
or a quantity of pus from the original point of ulcerative phlebitis
passes into the portal vein, and is generally distributed through the
hepatic branches, here and there foci of suppuration being established
by the deposit of decomposing emboli.There may be numerous small
abscesses irregularly distributed through the liver, or there may be
one or two larger collections of pus.Very often the vessel whose
occlusion by a suppurating embolus has caused the mischief is
destroyed, and hence no communication with the abscess-cavity can then
be traced.These abscesses are not limited by a line of inflammatory
demarcation or by a limiting membrane, but the hepatic tissue adjacent
is congested and infiltrated with pus.Ulceration, abscesses, or purulent inflammation occurring at any point
within the area of origin of the radicles of the portal vein may induce
pylephlebitis and consequent hepatic abscess.There are two points at
which, suppuration established, secondary pylephlebitis is most apt to
occur: the caecum; the rectum.As respects the former, the symptoms of
typhlitis precede the hepatic disturbance; and as respects the latter,
usually dysentery, or rather proctitis, is the initial disease.In both
sources of the hepatic trouble the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
chiefly concerned--a fact explicable by reference to the sluggishness
of the circulation and the distended condition of these veins, whence
it is that thrombus is very readily induced.Numerous instances of
pylephlebitis following suppurative lesions of the caecum have been
reported.One of the most recent, and at the same time typical,
examples of such conditions is that published by Bradbury[210] of
Cambridge, England.The initial lesion was "an ulcer the size of a
split pea" situated near "the junction of the vermiform appendix and
caecum.""The hemorrhoidal veins and the inferior mesenteric above were
filled with breaking-down clot and pus," and "the liver contained many
abscesses of various sizes, the largest about the size of a lemon,
which had burst through the diaphragm."As is so often the case, the
ulcer of the caecum produced no recognizable disturbance, and important
symptoms were manifest only when the emboli lodged in the liver set up
suppuration, when there occurred the usual signs of hepatic abscess.In
the West and South hepatic abscess due to pylephlebitis, induced by
proctitis, with ulceration of the rectum, is a common incident.Various
examples of this kind have fallen under my own observation.The
relatively greater frequency of this form of pylephlebitis is due to
the fact above {1099} stated, that the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
voluminous, have a sluggish current, and are liable to over-distension
by pressure of feces and by external abdominal bands and clothing.Cases of a corresponding character arise from suppuration and
ulceration elsewhere within the portal circuit.Thus, Bristowe[211]
reports a case in which pylephlebitis resulted from an ulcer of the
stomach, the neighboring veins becoming implicated and the usual
results following.[Footnote 210: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, Sept.450,
"Proceedings of the Cambridge Medical Society."][Footnote 211: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of London_,
vol.When inflammation has begun in a radicle of the portal vein, it may
proceed to the liver by contiguity of tissue, the whole intervening
portion of the vessel being affected.Probably more frequently the
intra-hepatic portion of the portal is inflamed by emboli, and the
adjacent hepatic tissue then undergoes suppuration, as has been already
set forth.SYMPTOMS.--There being two points of disease--the primary lesion of the
peripheral vessel and the secondary results in the hepatic portion of
the portal--the symptomatology must have a corresponding expression.The stomach, the caecum, or the rectum, or some other organ or tissue,
being occupied by a morbid process, there will be a characteristic
complex of symptoms.Taking up the most usual primary disturbance, a
typhlitis or an ulcer of the caecum, there will be pain, tenderness,
and possibly fever, occupying in point of time the period proper to
such a malady and an amount of disturbance of function determined by
the extent of the lesion.The symptoms caused by a single small ulcer
of the caecum, as in the example narrated by Bradbury, may present no
characteristic features and may have little apparent importance, and
yet the lesion is productive of very grave consequences.When from any of the causes mentioned above a thrombus forms in a vein
of the portal system in consequence of the extension of the
inflammation about it, the case, what importance soever it previously
had, now takes on new characters.The onset of the inflammation of the
vein walls and the puriform degeneration of the thrombus is announced
by a chill--a severe rigor, or chilly sensations at least.At the time
of the chill, and sometimes before it, pain is felt, significant of the
lesion in the vein.When proctitis or typhlitis precedes the
pylephlebitis, pain appropriate to the malady is a significant symptom;
but the pain which comes on with the beginning of the inflammation in
the liver is a new sign.The most frequent sites of the pain are the
right hypochondrium and the epigastrium, but it may also be felt in the
left hypochondrium or in either iliac fossa.Unless there be diffuse
peritonitis the pain is accompanied by a strictly-localized tenderness
to pressure.The situation of the pain may afford an indication of the
vein attacked, and when there are two points at which pain is
experienced, one may originate at the first situation of the morbid
action; the other will be due to pylephlebitis.The fever succeeding the chill is decided, and in some cases may attain
to extraordinary height--a manifestation indicative of the pyaemic
character of the affection.The fever intermits or remits, with a more
or less profuse perspiration.The febrile phenomena are similar in
their objective expression to malarial fever, but there is an important
difference in respect to the periods of recurrence of the chills.The
paroxysms are very irregular as to time: there may a daily seizure at
different hours, or there may be several chills on the same day.In
other words, the {1100} paroxysms have the pyaemic characteristics
rather than the malarial.After a time the intermittent phenomenon
ceases, and there occurs a remission merely, the exacerbation being
preceded by chilliness and succeeded by sweating.The sweats are
characteristically profuse and exhausting.During the sweating the
temperature begins to decline, and reaches its lowest point just before
the chilly sensations during the early morning announce the onset of
the daily exacerbation of the afternoon and evening.The thermal line
exhibits many irregularities until the febrile movement assumes the
remittent type, when there occur the morning remission and nocturnal
exacerbation.The maxima may be from 103 degrees F. to 105 degrees,
even to 106 degrees.When the pain and chill come on, disturbances of the digestive organs
ensue.When a large vein of the portal system is occluded, the
remaining veins must be over-distended, and congestion of a part or of
all of the digestive tract will be a result.An acute gastric catarrh
is set up.The appetite is lost, the stomach becomes irritable, and
vomiting is a usual incident.Sometimes the disgust for food is
extreme, and the nausea and vomiting are almost incessant.The vomited
matters consist of a watery mucus mixed with thin bile after a time,
and now and then of a bloody mucus.Thrombosis of a stomach vein may
occur, to be followed by an acute ulcer, and from this considerable
hemorrhage may proceed, when the vomit will consist of blood.Such an
accident, happening to the mucous membrane of the intestine, will be
indicated by bloody stools if the ulceration is low down, or by
brownish, blackish, or chocolate- stools if higher up in the
small bowel.The tongue has usually a characteristic coating in these cases.Large
patches of a rather heavy and darkish fur form, and, cast off from time
to time, leave a glazed and somewhat raw surface.Sometimes there is a
profuse salivary flow, but more frequently the mouth is dry.The lips
are fissured or contain patches of herpes, and the buccal cavity may be
more or less completely lined by patches of aphthae.Diarrhoea is a usual symptom, the stools being dark when mixed with
blood, or grayish and pasty or clay- when there is jaundice.Three-fourths of the cases of pylephlebitis are free from jaundice.This symptom may occur at the onset when the common duct is obstructed
by a calculus, but in other cases it appears when the formation of pus
in the liver exerts sufficient compression of the hepatic ducts to
prevent the passage of the bile.When jaundice occurs, it is accompanied by the usual symptoms.The
urine, previously unchanged, is now  by bile-pigment, and the
alterations in the renal structure and function belonging to jaundice
also take place.It sometimes happens that the obstruction of the portal vein is
sufficient to cause enlargement of the superficial veins of the
abdomen, but the duration of the disease is usually too brief to permit
much deviation from the normal, except rarely.In the cases
characterized by the occurrence of diffuse peritonitis the abdomen will
present a swollen and tense appearance, and there will be acute
tenderness to pressure.The area of hepatic and splenic dulness is not
increased from the outset, but is evident, as respects the spleen, soon
after the obstruction at the liver, and as respects the liver when the
formation of abscesses occurs.{1101} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of pylephlebitis
is compounded of the disturbance at the original point of disease, and
of the secondary inflammation at the several points in the liver where
emboli set up purulent inflammation.There are, therefore, two distinct
symptom-groups, and a short intervening period in which the first is
being merged into the second.The duration is variable, but the extreme
limits are not remote from each other, the condition of pylephlebitis
terminating in from two weeks to three months, the shorter being the
more usual.The termination is death, doubtless invariably; for, as in
true pyaemia arising from other causes, the septic changes in the blood
are such as to preclude the possibility of a return to the normal
condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The main point in the diagnosis consists in the occurrence
of an evident local inflammation, followed by the signs of suppuration
in the hepatic region coming on subsequent to ulceration and
suppuration at some point in the peripheral expansion of the portal
system.Thus, when a proctitis with ulceration of the rectum has been
in existence for some time, there occur pain and tenderness in the
hepatic region, accompanied by an irregularly intermittent fever and by
profuse sweating, it can be assumed with considerable certainty that
emboli have been deposited in some one or more of the terminal branches
of the portal.The evidences of hepatic trouble--swelling of the organ,
jaundice, etc.--and of portal obstruction, which then supervene,
indicate with some precision the nature of the case.TREATMENT.--Although pylephlebitis wears a most unfavorable aspect, the
possibility of a favorable result should always be entertained by the
therapeutist.As absorption of medicaments must be slow--indeed, uncertain--by the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane when there is portal occlusion, it is
well to attempt treatment by the skin and subcutaneous connective
tissue.Gastro-intestinal disturbance--nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea--should be treated by a combination of bismuth, creasote, and
glycerin--remedies acting locally chiefly.Ammonia--the carbonate and
solution of the acetate--is indicated, and should be given for the
purpose of dissolving thrombi and emboli.Corrosive sublimate, carbolic
acid, and quinine can be administered by the subcutaneous areolar
tissue.Quinine may also be introduced by friction with lard, and in
considerable quantity.V. PARASITES OF THE LIVER.Echinococcus of the Liver; Hydatids of the Liver.DEFINITION.--The echinococcus is the intermediate or larval stage in
the development of the Taenia echinococcus--the completed
parasite--whose chief habitat is the intestine of the dog.As the
natural and clinical history of parasites is elsewhere treated of, the
subject is here confined to the development of echinococci cysts in the
liver, its ducts, and vessels.CAUSES.--The presence of echinococcus vesicles in the liver is due to
{1102} the migration of the embryo from the intestinal canal.As
Davaine[212] has ascertained by analysis of all the recorded examples
previous to the publication of his treatise, echinococci are found in
as large a proportion in the liver as in all the other organs combined.This statement is repeated with approval by Cobbold[213] and by
Heller.[214] The embryo, set free in the intestine from the food or
drink containing the ova, starts on its migration.There are several
reasons why the liver is selected for its habitat: it is the largest
accessible organ; the common duct and the portal vein offer the most
convenient roadway for reaching and penetrating its substance.The
exact route or routes of which the parasite avails itself in migrating
have not been definitely settled, although Friedreich has shown that
the portal vein is the medium of transmission of the Echinococcus
multilocularis.The comparative frequency with which the liver is
entered indicates that the portal vein is the favorite route of
migration.[Footnote 212: _Traite des Entozoaires et des Maladies vermineuses,
etc._, par C. Davaine, Paris, 1877, p.[Footnote 213: _Entozoa_, by T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S., London,
1874, p.iii of _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.PATHOLOGY AND SYMPTOMS.--The number of echinococci reaching the liver
varies from one to ten or twelve or more.They increase in size from
the time of their deposit in the organ, and ultimately attain to large
proportions.The rapidity of growth depends somewhat on the character
of the tissue in which imbedded, and the amount of disturbance of
function is determined by the position of the parasite in the organ.Echinococci may be deposited in any part of the liver--in the substance
of the organ, in the ducts, or in the vessels--but the most usual site
is near the capsule, and, developing outwardly in the direction of
least resistance, impart to the outline of the organ an irregular
contour.As the echinococci develop, the adjacent parts of the liver
pressed upon undergo atrophy, but the connective tissue of the organ
contributes to the formation of the dense capsule which envelops them.But as the increase in size is not rapid, although continuous, if the
cysts are situated at the periphery and adjacent to the capsule, they
may be present for many months without causing any distinct symptoms.In a case occurring under my own observation last year the only symptom
which attracted attention was an enlargement of the hepatic region, and
on examination a characteristic elastic, irregular, and painless tumor
could be readily detected by sight and touch occupying the right
hypochondrium and extending into the epigastric and umbilical regions.When the echinococci cysts impinge on the portal vein or on the hepatic
duct, there will be caused the usual results of such pressure--ascites
or jaundice, or both conditions may occur simultaneously, with
obstruction of both vein and duct.When the cysts develop downwardly,
the stomach and intestines will be displaced, and nausea and vomiting,
diarrhoea or constipation, and, it may be, considerable pain of a
colic-like character, will be caused.An upward development of the
cysts gives rise to more pronounced disturbances.The diaphragm is
pushed upward, the heart displaced, and the lungs, especially the
right, compressed.Occasionally the diaphragm is softened and
perforated by the pressure of the enlarging cysts, and the lungs are
ultimately tunnelled, the parasites being discharged by the bronchi.{1103} The growth of an echinococcus tumor may spontaneously cease, and
then retrograde changes take place, leading to its final disappearance.This arrest of development may occur without any obvious cause, but now
and then such a change from the ordinary course of tumors may be
effected by an external injury, as a blow on the abdomen, but more
frequently the death of the parasite is caused by ulceration into a
bile-duct, and the entrance of bile, which is a poison to these
hydatids.It sometimes happens that, opening into a duct of large size,
the daughter and granddaughter vesicles are slowly discharged through
it into the intestine, and thus a cure is effected.Inflammatory action
occurring in the cysts, adhesions may form and rupture into a
neighboring cavity take place.Direct communication may be established
with the intestine, or the cavity of the pleura or peritoneum be
entered, with results entirely disastrous.A necessarily fatal termination must also ensue when the hydatids
penetrate the ascending vena cava, but this accident is, fortunately,
very rare.The passage outward through the abdominal wall is an exceedingly
uncommon but fortunate issue of echinococcus of the liver, for in this
mode the hydatids may be discharged without much difficulty.The echinococcus vesicle is enveloped in a dense, resisting, and
elastic capsule, constructed out of the connective tissue of the part
in which it is deposited.The innermost layer of the vesicle is the
germinative (endocyst), and from its granular surface are developed the
brood-capsules and their scolices--_i.e._ the head with its suckers and
crown of hooklets.[215] Each vesicle may contain not only daughter, but
also granddaughter, progeny, numbering from a dozen up to many
thousands, and they will vary in size from the head of a pin to a
pullet's egg.It follows that the mother vesicles must also greatly
vary in size: they range from a large pin's head to a child's head.The
vesicles or sacs contain a clear, faintly yellowish, or opalescent
fluid, neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction, and holding in
solution a large per cent.of sodium chloride, but free from albumen.The specific gravity of the fluid ranges from 1007 to 1015, according
to the quantity of sodium chloride present.Succinic acid and also
haematoidin are usual constituents, besides the ingredients already
mentioned.[Footnote 215: _Entozoa_, Cobbold, p.273 _et seq._, chapter viii.]Although the form of hydatid or echinococcus cyst above described is
the usual one, there is occasionally produced an anomalous development
of the parasite, which from its resemblance to colloid cancer was
supposed to have this character until Virchow[216] unravelled the
mystery by demonstrating its true structure.This form of the parasite
is designated Echinococcus multilocularis.Its resemblance to colloid
cancer is the more striking because of the tendency of the interior of
the mass to undergo degeneration, to disintegrate, and to break up into
pus-sacs with greenish, cheesy, and bilious contents.An Echinococcus
multilocularis tumor is of almost stony hardness; it has a very dense
fibrous structure, intersected by cavities with thick gelatinous
contents.These minor cavities[217] are sacs of echinococci, but they
depart widely from the typical form, well-defined scolices being seldom
encountered.[Footnote 216: _Archiv fur Anat._, Virchow, vol.[Footnote 217: Carriere, quoted by Davaine, _op.{1104} Echinococci of the liver develop very slowly, and it is
characteristic of them to attain to very large proportions in most
cases without causing any very pronounced symptoms.There are certain
signs common to hydatids in any situation; there are others which are
due to particular circumstances.A hydatid tumor of the liver is smooth but somewhat irregular in
outline, and elastic, when it develops downward, extending below the
margin of the ribs.If, however, it grows upward, the area of hepatic
dulness extends in that direction beyond the usual limits; the
diaphragm is pushed up, the lungs forced upward to the left and
compressed, and the heart also displaced upward toward the left.The
extension of the tumor downward, in the direction of least resistance,
is more usual.If the walls of the abdomen are sufficiently thin, the
tumor large enough, and if made up of many daughter vesicles, there may
be evoked by palpation the very characteristic sign known as hydatid
purring.To produce this effect an oscillation must be caused by a
sudden impulse communicated to the tumor on one side, the hand resting
against the other side.This sensation is likened to the impression on
the eye of the vibration of a bowl of jelly.Even when there is a
well-defined tumor this symptom is comparatively infrequent, but if
present it is pathognomonic, since no other kind of tumor possesses the
property of oscillation and elastic collision of its several
constituents.When the tumor is so situated as to occlude the hepatic or common duct,
jaundice will be a symptom, and when the stomach is pressed upon there
will be epigastric oppression and nausea.If the vena cava is impinged
on or the portal vein, the usual results--ascites and oedema of the
lower extremities and of the scrotum--will be manifest.There is, of
course, nothing distinctive in these results.The Echinococcus multilocularis, situated in the substance of the
liver, causes the usual disturbances of a new formation in such a
position.Much of the hepatic tissue is destroyed by its growth, and
many of the minor ducts closed.Jaundice is an early symptom--the
first, indeed, in many cases--and is also one of the most persistent.It is present, according to Griesinger, in 10 out of 13 cases.The
usual gastro-intestinal disorders belonging to jaundice occur under
these circumstances; also the nervous disturbances of cholaemia.[218]

[Footnote 218: Davaine, _op.Enlargement of the spleen is a very frequent symptom, being present,
according to Davaine, in 11 out of 13 cases, and, according to Heller,
in 25 out of 29 cases, in which this fact was made the subject of
direct inquiry.Pressure on the vena cava causes oedema of the inferior extremities in
a small number of cases; and on the vena porta, ascites.There may
occur thrombosis of the portal, in which event the ascites will form
very quickly, and return as quickly after tapping.The usually placid course pursued by echinococcus of the liver may be
much modified by inflammation and suppuration.Having occurred, the clinical history
corresponds to other cases of hepatic abscess, and the reader is
therefore referred to the section on that topic for fuller information.DIAGNOSIS.--At the outset of echinococcus of the liver the {1105}
differentiation of the tumor from other tumors, and of the disturbances
produced by it as contrasted with the effects of other morbid growths,
becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.The size,
painlessness, elasticity, the purring tremor of the echinococcus tumor,
afford a sure basis for constructing a diagnosis, and as ultimately
developed they become the means of accurate differentiation from other
morbid growths of that locality.All doubt as to the nature of a given
hydatid tumor of the liver may be set at rest by the use of the
aspirator.The discovery of the characteristic hooklets of the scolex
in the fluid withdrawn from the tumor will be conclusive as to the
presence of echinococci.The hooklets may be absent, as in the case of
acephalocysts, but the fluid is characteristic in other respects: it
contains a large quantity of chloride of sodium and is free from
albumen.Very great difficulty is experienced in diagnosticating an echinococcus
tumor developing from the upper surface of the liver, pushing the
diaphragm and lungs upward and displacing the heart to the left.Whilst
the physical signs may be, and are, usually alike when the condition
calling for diagnosis has existed for some time, there are means of
differentiating in the history of the cases and in the initial
symptoms.The origin and growth of the echinococcus tumor are obscure and free
from constitutional disturbance; the onset of a pleuritic exudation is
marked by pain, fever, and hurried respiration and by physical signs of
a characteristic kind.It is true there are cases of so-called latent
pleurisy in which a hydrothorax forms without any well-marked
indications, but it will usually be found that some local pain, hurried
breathing, or other symptoms existed from the beginning.Those cases of
hydrothorax accompanying renal and cardiac diseases are readily enough
associated with their original cause.Echinococcus of the liver may be confounded with abscess of the liver,
but a differentiation can be readily made by attention to a few
considerations, except in the rare condition of the Echinococcus
multilocularis which has proceeded to suppuration.In this latter
condition there are no means of differentiation, since an
abscess-formation has already occurred, nor is there any need to
attempt a distinction without the occasion of a difference.Echinococcus differs from abscess in history, in the character of the
swelling, and in progress.Abscess of the liver is preceded by
paroxysms of hepatic colic, by inflammatory ulceration of some part of
the intestinal tract, or by local injury--traumatism.The onset of a
hydatid tumor is silent and painless.The swelling of the liver when an
abscess forms is not considerable at any time, and appears to be a
uniform enlargement of the organ, except when the pus tends to make its
way through the walls of the abdomen externally.An enlarging
echinococcus tumor is an obvious projection from the surface of the
liver at some point, and it does not have the characteristic
tenderness, the fluctuation of an abscess matured and ready to
discharge, and the constitutional disturbance; but it does have a
peculiar elasticity, and now and then may present that eminently
characteristic sign, the purring tremor.The use of the
exploring-trocar will usually suffice to clear up all doubts by the
withdrawal of the characteristic fluid of the hydatid cyst or of pus.DURATION AND TERMINATION.--The progress of an echinococcus {1106} tumor
is exceedingly slow, and the development of symptoms produced by its
extension is early or late according to its position and to the nature
of the parts impinged on.A spontaneous cure may take place under the
rather rare circumstances of an opening into the hepatic duct or one of
its principal divisions, and the gradual discharge of the cysts by this
outlet into the intestine.Next to this mode of termination, the most
fortunate direction taken by the enlarging cysts is through the walls
of the abdomen externally.When the growth is upward through the lungs,
the symptoms belonging to empyema or hydrothorax, with pulmonary
abscess, ensue, and the termination is fatal after a protracted course.Rupture into the peritoneal cavity is a fatal event.Ulceration into
the intestine, and the discharge of the cysts through the route thus
made, may effect a cure, but more frequently the fistulous
communication becomes a means of forming a fecal abscess.The result in any case of hydatids of the liver is much influenced by
the mode of treatment adopted and the period at which it is undertaken.As these parasites can be readily reached and destroyed by safe means,
obviously the more early the diagnosis is made and the treatment
carried out, the less the injury done to the hepatic structures and
neighboring parts.TREATMENT.--Prophylactic.--As the intestine of the dog is the natural
habitat of the Taenia echinococcus, and as the hydatid is the first
stage in the development of the ovum and the second in the life-history
of the parasite, the means of prophylaxis consist in preventing
contamination of human food and water with the dog's excrement, which
contains the ova of the parasite.In Iceland, where hydatid disease is
very prevalent, dogs and human beings living in the same huts and
obtaining their water-supply by melting the snow just about them,
contamination of food and drink must readily occur.In this country
such conditions cannot exist; nevertheless, cases of hydatids are not
infrequent.The chief, if not the only, source of contamination is
through the consumption of such uncooked vegetables as lettuce, celery,
cabbage, etc., in the folds of which the ova may be retained, and from
which an ordinary washing does not suffice to detach them.It follows
that such articles of food should be minutely inspected and cleansed
before being placed on the table.Boiling and filtration are the means of removing impurities of this
kind from potable waters.Therapeutical.--The remedial management of cases of Taenia echinococcus
is necessarily restricted to that stage in their development when by
increasing size the functions of organs begin to be affected.Internal
medicines given with the view to arrest the growth of the parasite are
useless.Formerly, such attempts were made and successes were claimed,
but it is now known that no medicine can act on organisms enclosed as
these are in a dense capsule.It is needless to occupy space with
therapeutical details of this kind, but mention may be made of the
agents that were supposed to be effective.Laennec held that baths of a
solution of common salt had a distinct curative effect.The internal
use of iodide of potassium and the local application of iodine paint
were believed to cure a case in St.George's Hospital, London, in the
practice of Mr.Kameela was, in Iceland, supposed to
have a curative effect, but notwithstanding this the physicians of that
island resort to very heroical surgical methods in the treatment of
this affection.{1107} The one means of relief consists in the removal of the vesicles,
either by suitable incisions or by compassing the death of the
parasite, after which the power of nature may be adequate to the cure.In Iceland large incisions are made into the tumor at its most
prominent part, and, although accidents are not uncommon, the results
in many cases are eminently satisfactory.The accidents are shock,
hemorrhage, and especially peritonitis.Under favorable circumstances
now no procedure is more satisfactory in its results than free incision
and drainage.The tumor should be prominent, adherent all round to the
peritoneum, and the walls of the abdomen thin to ensure complete
success without accident.At the present time, so great have been the
advances in abdominal surgery, this operative procedure may be
preferable in some few cases presenting the favoring conditions above
mentioned.Very simple expedients, however, suffice in most cases.This is now much practised in Iceland, and, as the
statistics show, with considerable success.Thus, Hjaltelin[219]
reports 100 cases cured in this way, and in his own hands this
expedient proved successful in 41 out of 50 cases operated on.In
Australia, where hydatid disease is also quite common, simple puncture
has effected a large proportion of cures,[220] and is the method of
treatment usually pursued.In England puncture has the approval of some
of the best authorities.[221]

[Footnote 219: Davaine, _op.[Footnote 220: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, August, 1873, p.[Footnote 221: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_ for 1872:
discussion participated in by Gull, Bryant, Greenhow, etc.]The mode of performing this operation consists in the introduction of
an exploring-trocar into the most prominent part of the tumor.It may
be withdrawn at once or be permitted to remain for a few minutes to
several hours.The dangers are suppuration in the sac and peritonitis;
but the former, although sometimes accompanied by severe constitutional
symptoms, is not likely to endanger life, and even formidable
disturbances due to the latter are usually recovered from.The facts
show that puncture very rarely indeed causes dangerous, especially
fatal, symptoms.An eruption of urticaria has been observed to follow
puncture with the trocar, and also aspiration, in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but it has no special significance.Since the introduction of the aspirateur, puncture and withdrawal of
the fluid by means of this instrument has been practised more
frequently, and this appears to be a more effective procedure, than
simple puncture with an exploring-trocar, although in most cases the
escape of the contained fluids suffices to destroy the parasite.The
aspirateur is less likely to permit the escape of fluid into the
peritoneal cavity or the entrance of air into a vein punctured by
accident.If puncture with the trocar or aspiration be practised, shall
all the fluid be withdrawn at once?The answer to this question may be
decided by the character of the sac.Does it contain daughter and
granddaughter vesicles?If so, one puncture may not permit the escape
of much fluid; but in any event it is the practice of the most
judicious and experienced authorities[222] to withdraw as much as
possible of the contents of the cysts at the first operation.Formerly,
a method practised by some French surgeons consisted in successive
tappings, a small quantity of fluid being drawn off each time.[223]
{1108} There is no good reason for this method of treatment now, and it
seems to have been discontinued.[Footnote 222: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 223: Davaine, _supra_.]Yet another method of treatment, but less effective than puncture or
aspiration, consists in injecting into the sac, after the removal of
its contained fluid, certain agents toxic to hydatids.A solution of
the extract of fern, alcohol, solution or tincture of iodine, and bile,
are the chief remedies thus employed.It has long been known that bile
is destructive of these parasites, and cases have occurred of
spontaneous cure in which the opening of the growing cysts into a
bile-duct has secured the entrance of bile and consequent arrest of
growth and atrophy of the hydatids.Several successful cases have been
reported in which the injection of aspidium (male fern) was the
effective agent, but the threatening symptoms produced by it, and the
comparative freedom of other methods of treatment from such
disturbances, do not recommend the injections of fern.In the case
reported by Pavy[224] the extract of fern was mixed with a solution of
potassa.[Footnote 224: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1865.]Injections of iodine in solution or in the form of tincture have been
more frequently practised than of any other material.Davaine,[225] who
finds it less successful than simple puncture and aspiration,
recommends, as affording the best results, a dilute aqueous solution of
iodine.Alcohol, a solution of permanganate of potassium, and various
antiseptic agents have been used to some extent, but none of them
possess any advantages over more simple measures.The latest proposal for the treatment of hydatid cysts, and probably
the most effective consistent with entire safety, is electrolysis.Originally suggested by Althaus[226] to those who first employed the
measure on any considerable scale, it had been mentioned thirty years
before by Budd, and appears to have been first practised in Iceland on
a single case.The first elaborate attempt to establish electrolysis on
a sound basis as a regular procedure was made by C. Hilton Fagge and
Mr.[227] They operated on eight cases, and all were
successful.The method consists in the introduction of two needles
connected with the negative pole, and the application of the
positive--a moistened sponge--on the exterior in the neighborhood of
the hepatic region.The strength of current employed by Fagge and
Durham was that furnished by a battery of ten cells, and which by
previous trial was found to decompose a saline solution.The two
electrolytic needles, connected with wires attached to the negative
pole, were introduced into the most prominent part of the tumor about
two inches apart.The current was allowed to pass about ten minutes
usually, sometimes a little longer, the sponge on the exterior--the
positive pole--being shifted occasionally.The tumor may be rendered somewhat more tense and
appear to be enlarged, but more frequently it becomes softer and is
lessened in size, the increase of size being due to the disengagement
of hydrogen gas, and the diminution caused by the escape of more or
less fluid.In one case
no symptom followed, and in this the result was regarded as doubtful,
although a cure was considered probable.In the others more or less
{1109} constitutional disturbance followed, the symptoms being pain and
fever, the temperature ranging between 100 degrees and 103 degrees F.
The duration of the fever was from two to nineteen days, the latter in
one case only.As has been observed in some of the cases treated by
puncture or by aspiration, a rash appeared on the skin--in some
instances scarlatinous, in others of urticaria.It is a curious
circumstance that an eruption of urticaria is reported to have appeared
in one subject in whom a rupture of the sac into the peritoneal cavity
is supposed to have occurred.[Footnote 226: _On the Electrolytic Treatment of Tumors, etc._, London,
1867.][Footnote 227: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, 1871, p.1 _et seq._]

Although so little change in the tumor occurs immediately after the
operation, yet it undergoes slow absorption, and ultimately disappears.The time occupied in the disappearance of the tumor varies from a few
weeks to many months, the difference being due probably to the
situation of the growth, those occupying the substance of the liver
requiring a longer time to fill up.Fagge and Durham report a case in which simple acupuncture was followed
by a result apparently as good as obtained by electrolysis, and other
similar experiences have been published.If the simple introduction of
a needle suffices to arrest the growth of a hydatid cyst and induce its
atrophy, of course the more complex procedures will be abandoned.The tendency of the treatment of hydatid cysts has constantly been
toward simplicity, and the success occurs in a direct ratio thereto.In
forming an estimate of the relative value of the methods of treatment,
the average of mortality of each plan becomes the most important
factor.Simple tapping and paracentesis, the most frequently adopted
mode of treatment, is not without immediate and remote danger.Of 46
cases carefully tabulated by Murchison,[228] there were 3 deaths
properly attributable to the operation; but the after
results--suppuration of the cyst and its consequences, peritonitis,
etc.--cannot be measured so accurately.About two-thirds of the cases
thus treated result in cure, and in a majority of these a single
operation suffices.The injection of the various substances which have
been employed for that purpose does not seem to increase the proportion
of cures, and their use distinctly enhances the dangers of the
treatment.At present, the decision as to the method of treatment to be
employed in any case should be made between simple tapping,
electrolysis, and acupuncture.Of these, the last mentioned, it can
hardly be doubted, is the method which is most desirable, for although
it has not been employed so largely as the others, thus far the results
have been better: the percentage of recoveries without accident has
been higher relatively than by other methods of treatment.As
acupuncture presents no special difficulties or dangers, and is but
little painful, it may be tried first, reserving more formidable
measures for the failures by this simple expedient.[Footnote 228: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]


Distoma hepaticum and Distoma lanceolatum (Liver-Flukes).The Distoma hepaticum, entitled by Linnaeus Fasciola hepatica, occurs
very frequently in herbivorous animals and occasionally in the biliary
{1110} passages of man.[229] It is, however, less important than the
Distoma lanceolatum, which, although much smaller than the former,
occurs in much larger numbers.[Footnote 229: Davaine, _Traite des Entozoaires_, Paris, 1877, p.240
_et seq._; also, Cobbold, _Entozoa_, p.Distoma hepaticum is a leech-like parasite from 25 to 30 mm.in length,
of a brownish color, smooth to the naked eye, but thickly covered with
minute spikes or spines to be seen with a low power, and provided with
a cephalic (entrance to oral cavity) and an abdominal sucking disk,
which are also organs of locomotion.The Distoma lanceolatum owes its
name to its lancet shape; it is smaller than D. hepaticum, measuring
about 8 mm.in length and half this or less in width; it is unprovided
with spines, but contains two suckers at the side.Both parasites are
hermaphrodite; the ova, according to Cobbold (p.166), have "an average
longitudinal diameter of 1/180, whilst their greatest transversal
measurement is about 1/270."These ova are capable of some movement,
provided as they are with a ciliated envelope.The disease known as the rot in sheep, and a peculiar cachexia entitled
by Davaine la cachexie aqueuse, are caused by the presence of distoma.The ova gain access to man through the use of unwashed cress, lettuce,
and similar vegetables eaten in the raw state, and in drinking-water.The number of reported examples
collected from all sources by the indefatigable Davaine is twelve.[230]

[Footnote 230: _Ibid._, p.253 _et seq._]

The larger distoma passes into the common and hepatic duct and
gall-bladder, whilst the smaller (lanceolatum) enters the finer
ramifications, and, there multiplying, several consequences may ensue.The irritation caused by their presence and development will excite a
more or less severe cholangitis, or, accumulating in sufficient
numbers, an actual obstruction will be induced, and jaundice and
structural alterations of the liver will in turn be brought on.The DIAGNOSIS of such a malady is, in the very nature of the case,
uncertain at best, and in most cases impossible.Nevertheless, it may
be made in rare instances.The existence of the rot may cast suspicion
on the mutton and kitchen vegetables so situated as to suggest the
possibility of contamination with the ova of distoma.Definite and
conclusive information will be afforded by the presence of the ova,
still more of the more or less fully-developed parasite, in the feces
of a patient effected by the symptoms of catarrhal jaundice or
occlusion of the biliary passages.By tapping the gall-bladder
parasites may be withdrawn.The SYMPTOMS are those common to cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts
(cholangitis), catarrhal jaundice, or occlusion of the passages, as may
be.As these have been detailed under their respective heads, it is not
necessary to repeat the observations already made.As regards the TREATMENT, in addition to the methods of management
recommended in such cases it may be stated that the use of certain
parasiticides offers a reasonable prospect of good results.Creasote,
bichloride of mercury, thymol, eucalyptol, oil of wintergreen
(gaultheria), and similar agents are rational remedies and should be
fairly tried.{1111} Parasites in the Portal Vein.The entozoon which by its presence in the blood causes the disease
chyluria also inhabits the portal vein.In some parts of the
world--Brazil more especially--this disease is exceedingly common.It
has occurred also in two or three instances in England, and the writer
has had a case within the past year (1884) in Philadelphia.The
parasites in this case were found in immense numbers in the urine.The blood of the portal vein sometimes is actually filled, and the
liver substance itself is penetrated, by them, but nothing is known of
the alterations they induce in these organs.When cases of haematuria
or chylous urine due to the Filaria sanguinis hominis occur, the
changes are not confined to the urinary organs, but often, doubtless,
involve the liver.There are no signs in the present state of our
knowledge by which the existence of these parasites in the portal vein
and liver can be determined.{1112}

DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS.BY LOUIS STARR, M.D.Until the middle of the seventeenth century the prevalent views upon
the functions and diseases of the pancreas were vague in the extreme.By some the organ was regarded simply as a cushion provided for the
protection of the neighboring blood-vessels and nerves; by others it
was looked upon as the seat of lesion in many very diverse diseases, as
ague, hypochondriasis, melancholia, and so on.In 1642, Wirsung's discovery of an excretory duct demonstrated the fact
that the pancreas was a special organ, and initiated the successful
investigation of the physiology and pathology of the gland.For many
years after this, however, little progress was made, and it is only
comparatively recent investigations that have furnished definite and
reliable information upon the subject.Even now our knowledge of the
clinical and pathological features of diseases of the pancreas is far
behind that of many of the other viscera of the body, the chief reasons
for this being the uncertainty in regard to the physiology of the gland
and the rarity with which its lesions are primary and uncomplicated.ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.--The pancreas is a long, somewhat flattened,
narrow, acinous gland, pinkish-white in color, and of looser texture
than the salivary glands, which it otherwise closely resembles in
structure.It is hammer-shaped, measures from six to eight inches in
length, one and a half inches in breadth, and about three-fourths of an
inch in thickness, and varies in weight from three to five ounces.The
gland is situated in the upper part of the abdominal cavity; the
expanded portion, or head, lies in the concavity of the duodenum;
thence it extends transversely across the epigastric and both
hypochondriac regions on a level with the first lumbar vertebra and in
contact with the posterior abdominal wall.As it passes toward the left
it gradually decreases in size, and the narrowest part, or tail, rests
against the spleen.Behind the organ are the crura of the diaphragm,
the aorta, the inferior cava, the superior mesenteric vessels, and the
solar plexus; in front of it, the stomach and the left lobe of the
liver.Its anterior surface alone is invested with peritoneum, being
covered by the posterior layer of the lesser omentum.The ascending
portion of the head is intimately connected with the duodenum by dense
connective tissue, and at times the descending portion, by extending
backward and outward, forms an almost complete ring around the gut; the
body is loosely attached by connective tissue to the posterior
abdominal wall, and the {1113} left extremity and tail are joined to
the left kidney and suprarenal capsule and to the spleen by loose
areolar tissue.The gland is supplied with arterial blood by branches
springing from the pancreatico-duodenal and splenic vessels; its veins
join the splenic and superior mesenteric veins; its lymphatics
communicate with the lumbar glands; and its nerves are branches from
the solar plexus.The principal excretory duct, the canal of Wirsung,
has at its widest part the calibre of a goose-quill.It begins by the
union of five small branches at the tail, and extends transversely
through the substance of the gland from left to right, nearer the lower
than the upper border, and the anterior than the posterior surface; it
is joined throughout its course by numerous small branches from the
acini, which enter it at acute angles.In the head the duct curves
slightly downward, and as a rule opens with the ductus choledochus into
the ampulla of Vater in the second portion of the duodenum; sometimes,
however, it has a separate opening into the intestine.A second,
smaller, duct runs from the ascending portion of the head, and usually
joins the main duct, but may also open independently.The acini of the gland are from.045 mm.in diameter, and
are composed of a very thin membrane lined with pavement cells.The
thin walls of the excretory ducts are formed of connective tissue and
elastic fibres, and are lined by a single layer of small cylindrical
epithelial cells.The terminal extremities of the ducts form a complete
network around the glandular cells, resembling the intralobular biliary
canaliculi.The acini are imbedded in a mass of adipose tissue which
contains the vessels and nerves.The topographical relation of the head of the pancreas to the ductus
choledochus is of clinical importance.As a rule (fifteen times in
twenty-two, Wyss), the bile-duct descends near the head, toward the
duodenum; frequently it runs through this part of the organ, being
either partially or entirely surrounded by the gland substance.Now,
when the bile-duct merely passes over the pancreas, any enlargement,
unless excessive, would simply push it aside, but when it passes
through the head, a comparatively slight amount of disease is
sufficient to close it entirely and cause jaundice.It is only since the observations of Bernard in 1848 that the
prominence of the pancreatic juice as a digestive fluid has been
recognized.It fulfils several important purposes: in the first place,
it emulsifies the fatty articles of food; secondly, it converts starch
and cane-sugar into glucose; and, finally, it supplements the action of
the gastric juice upon nitrogenous materials and completes their
digestion.Each of these changes is probably brought about through the
agency of a special ferment (Danilewsky).The pancreatic juice is not
secreted continuously.According to the observations of Bernstein,
there are two separate secretory flows following each ingestion of
food--one occurring shortly after the food enters the stomach; the
other a few hours later, corresponding in time to the passage of the
food from the stomach into the intestine, the latter being followed by
a period of rest until the next meal.Both the condition of nausea and
the act of vomiting arrest the secretion.When the vagus is divided and
the central extremity of the cut nerve is irritated, the secretion is
also arrested, and remains checked {1114} for a long time.The arrest
in each instance is attributed to reflex action of the spinal cord and
sympathetic nerve.At the same time, irritation of the mucous membrane
of the stomach caused by the presence of food increases the flow of
pancreatic juice, and so too does simple section of the nerves which
accompany the arteries.It would seem, therefore, that the gland is
under the influence of two sets of nerves from the vagus--one
inhibiting, the other exciting, its secretion.GENERAL ETIOLOGY.--Pancreatic disease occurs more frequently in men
than in women.No period of life is exempt from it, but it is most
commonly met with in the aged.The predisposing causes are
constitutional syphilis, pregnancy, and hereditary tendency.Among the
apparent exciting causes may be mentioned the habitual over-use of
alcoholic drinks, gluttony, the excessive use of tobacco, suppression
of the menstrual flux, the abuse of purgatives, excessive and prolonged
mercurial medication, and mechanical injuries, either prolonged
pressure or blows upon the epigastrium.As a secondary affection,
disease of the pancreas is associated with chronic diseases of the
heart, lungs, liver, alimentary canal, and abdominal glands, and the
organ may be the seat of metastatic abscesses and tumors.GENERAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The objective symptoms are--rapid and extreme
emaciation of the entire body; sialorrhoea; obstinate diarrhoea with
viscid stools; fatty stools; lipuria; and the presence of masses of
undigested striped muscular fibres in the stools.The well-established fat-absorbing and peptonizing properties of the
pancreatic juice furnish a ready explanation of the wasting of the body
which occurs when this secretion is arrested, diminished in quantity,
or altered in quality by disease.Emaciation is not a constant symptom
of pancreatic disease.A number of cases are mentioned by Abercrombie,
Claessen, and Schiff in which, notwithstanding disease of the gland and
complete closure of the duct, revealed by post-mortem examination, the
patients during life were not only well nourished, but even moderately
corpulent.In such instances it is probable that the digestive
functions of the absent pancreatic juice are more or less adequately
performed by the bile and succus entericus.When present, emaciation is
an early symptom; it is at the same time progressive, and is usually
very intense in degree, being most marked in those cases where there is
associated hepatic disease or obstruction to the passage of bile into
the intestine, where the disease of the pancreas interferes
mechanically with the processes of nutrition by pressing upon the
pyloric extremity of the stomach or upon the duodenum, and when the
organ is the seat of carcinomatous growths.In the last-named
condition, in addition to the perversion or arrest of the secretion,
the loss of flesh is attributable to the general causes of malnutrition
attendant upon carcinoma wherever situated.Sialorrhoea, or an excessive secretion from the salivary glands, is
noticeable as a symptom of disease of the pancreas only when there is
an associated lesion of the stomach, either of a catarrhal or cancerous
nature.Under these circumstances a quantity--six or eight
fluidounces--of a colorless, slightly opalescent, and adhesive and
alkaline fluid may be expelled from the mouth at once as an early
morning pyrosis; or by frequent and repeated acts of expectoration,
following a sudden filling of the mouth with fluid, a large bulk of
thin saliva may be expelled {1115} during the day.This hypersecretion
must not be looked upon as any indication of an especial sympathy
existing between the salivary glands and the pancreas, neither can it
be regarded as a pancreatic flux with a regurgitation of the fluid from
the duodenum into the stomach and thence through the oesophagus into
the mouth, since during the nausea that must always attend the passage
of the intestinal contents into the stomach the pancreatic secretion is
arrested, and since the liquid contains salivary, and not pancreatic,
elements.The diarrhoea pancreatica is the least constant of all the objective
symptoms; in fact, constipation is present in many pancreatic
affections, notably carcinoma.The fecal evacuations in this condition
are frequent, thin, viscid, and contain an abundance of leucin.Under
the microscope the leucin appears either in the form of concentrically
sheathed globules, or as small crystalline rods and scales collected
together in the form of wheels or aggregated in clusters.This form of
diarrhoea may be attributed to a hypersecretion from the pancreas.That the presence of fat in the stools is an important diagnostic
symptom of pancreatic disease is proved both by clinical and
experimental observations.The characters of these stools vary
considerably.The fat may appear mixed with the feces in small lumps,
ranging in size from a pea to a hazelnut, yellowish-white in color,
soluble in aether, and easily melted and burned.Again, after the
evacuation has become cool fat may be seen covering the fecal masses,
collected into a thick cake around the edges of the containing vessel,
or, when the feces are liquid, floating as free oil on the surface.Finally, the fat may be in a crystalline form, the crystals being
needle-shaped and aggregated into sheaves and tufts.It may be present only in small quantities, or may
even be entirely absent from the evacuations in those cases in which
the secretion from the pancreas is simply diminished, and the amount is
greatest in those instances where there is a simultaneous arrest of the
pancreatic and hepatic secretions.It must be remembered, too, that
even in health the stools may contain fat; this occurs when an excess
of oleaginous food is consumed and after the administration of castor
oil or cod-liver oil.These conditions must be eliminated, therefore,
in estimating the value of fatty stools as a diagnostic symptom; if,
then, at the same time, coincident disease of the liver can be
excluded, the symptom becomes almost pathognomonic.The appearance of
fat in the stools may be due not only to an arrest of the pancreatic
secretion, but also to pressure upon the large lymphatic trunks,
interfering with the circulation of the chyle and checking the
absorption of fat from the intestine.Usually, the amount of fat expelled is in direct proportion to the
quantity consumed, but occasionally the former greatly exceeds the
latter.In such cases there must be some other source for the evacuated
fat than the food; and it is probable that fat from the adipose tissue
passes into the blood, and thence through the mesenteric vessels into
the intestine.This theory would likewise account in part for the rapid
and extreme wasting, and for another less frequently observed
symptom--namely, lipuria.A case is recorded by Clark of medullary
cancer of the pancreas with nutmeg liver, and another by Bowditch of
cancer of the pancreas and liver in which lipuria was noted.The fat
was observed, after the urine had cooled, floating about on the surface
in masses or globules; differing, {1116} therefore, from chyluria, for
in this condition the fat is present in the form of an emulsion, and
gives the urine either a uniform milk-like appearance, or, after it has
been allowed to stand, rests upon the surface in a creamy layer.When the pancreatic secretion is arrested, most of the animal food
which has escaped gastric digestion will pass unchanged through the
intestine and give rise to another characteristic condition of the
evacuations--namely, the presence in the feces of undigested striped
muscular fibres.The amount of these fibres, and indeed their
appearance at all in any given case, will depend directly upon the
nature of the food consumed.SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS.--The subjective symptoms of disease of the
pancreas are abnormal sensations in the epigastrium, and pain.The abnormal sensations in the epigastrium are weight and pressure,
attended at times by praecordial oppression and discomfort.The feeling
of weight is usually deep-seated, may be intermittent or constant, and
is generally increased or developed by pressure.It is often influenced
by position, the assumption of the erect posture or turning from side
to side giving rise to a stretching or dragging sensation, as if a
heavy body were falling downward or moving about in the upper abdomen.The pain may be due either to an inflammation of the peritoneum
covering the gland or to pressure upon the solar plexus, and
consequently varies in character.When it depends upon localized
peritonitis, it is constant, circumscribed, and deeply seated in the
epigastrium at a point midway between the tip of the ensiform cartilage
and the umbilicus; it is rather acute, and is greatly augmented by
pressure.The second variety occurs in paroxysms, and is neuralgic in
character, the sharp, excessively severe lancinating pains extending
from the epigastrium through to the back, upward into the thorax, and
downward into the abdomen.These paroxysms--in reality attacks of
coeliac neuralgia--are attended by great anxiety, restlessness, and
oppression and a tendency to syncope.That calculi in the duct of
Wirsung, tightly grasped at the position of arrest, may give rise to
paroxysms of pain analogous to biliary colic, cannot be doubted, though
there are no positive facts in support of this view.PRESSURE SYMPTOMS.--When the pancreas becomes enlarged it encroaches
upon the neighboring blood-vessels and viscera, interferes with their
functions, and thus produces prominent symptoms.The ductus choledochus from its close relation to the head of the gland
is especially liable to become obstructed, with the consequent
production of chronic jaundice and the general effects of the absence
of bile from the intestinal canal.Pressure upon the portal vein gives
rise to enlargement of the spleen; on the inferior cava, to oedema of
the feet and legs; and on the aorta, occasionally, to aneurismal
dilatation of the vessel above the point of obstruction and to
subsequent alteration in the size of the heart.By encroaching on the
stomach an enlarged pancreas may cause either displacement of the
viscus or stenosis at its pyloric extremity, attended with occasional
vomiting of large quantities of grumous, fermenting liquid, pain,
constipation, general failure of health, and the distinctive physical
signs of dilatation of the stomach.The duodenum may also be pressed
upon and more or less occluded, and pain and vomiting occur several
hours after food is taken.Occasionally hydronephrosis is {1117}
produced, the accumulation being usually in the right kidney and due to
obstruction of the corresponding ureter.A sufficient number of cases have been collected to show that there is
an intimate connection between disease of the pancreas and diabetes
mellitus.One or other condition may take the precedence, melituria
occurring during the progress of pancreatic disease, demonstrating the
onset of diabetes, and the appearance of fatty stools in diabetes a
secondary involvement of the pancreas.Various theories have been
advanced to account for this association, but the true explanation
seems to be based upon the experiments of Munk and Klebs.By
experimenting upon dogs these observers found that extirpation of the
solar plexus produced either permanent or temporary diabetes, whereas
section of the hepatic and splanchnic nerves, removal of the pancreas,
or ligature of the duct of Wirsung was without effect.From the
intimate anatomical relation of the pancreas to the solar plexus it is
easy to understand how disease of the gland may give rise to
alterations in the nerve-structure, either by direct pressure or by the
extension of inflammation along the nerve-fibres connecting the gland
with the ganglia; and these alterations in time produce diabetes.In
the instances in which diabetes is the primary affection the condition
of the pancreas, as proved by post-mortem section, is usually one of
simple or fatty atrophy; and it may be assumed that a lesion of the
solar plexus is the cause of both diseases, the changes in the pancreas
being produced in a similar way to the atrophy of the submaxillary
gland after section of the vaso-motor nerves in Bernard's experiments.The same nerve-lesion may give rise to bronzing of the skin, and two
cases are recorded in which disease of the pancreas (cheesy
infiltration, cancer) was attended by this symptom.PHYSICAL SIGNS.--To make a successful exploration of the pancreas the
stomach and colon should be as far as possible empty, and the patient
placed in a position, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated and
the thighs drawn up toward the belly, to relax the abdominal muscles;
or if necessary this relaxation must be brought about by the
administration of aether.The knee-elbow position is often preferable
to the dorsal position in practising palpation.The condition of the gland giving rise to physical signs is one of
enlargement, affecting chiefly and primarily its head, and due
generally to the presence of some morbid growth.Inspection reveals either a diffuse bulging of the upper third of the
abdomen to the right of the median line, or a well-defined tumor
situated beneath the right costal border, about the line of junction of
the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions.Often the pancreatic
tumor does not come in direct contact with the abdominal wall, but
presses against and thrusts forward the left lobe of the liver,
producing simply a prominence in the epigastrium.In the first
condition palpation elicits an ill-defined sense of resistance; in the
second, the fingers readily outline a tumor, which is slightly movable,
rounded in shape, firm or fluctuating, with a smooth or nodulated
surface, usually tender to the touch, and often giving a false impulse
transmitted from the aorta lying beneath; and in the third, the smooth
surface and the sharp edge of the left lobe of the liver are easily
distinguishable.{1118} Percussion over a pancreatic tumor is commonly dully-tympanitic,
absolute flatness occurring only when it is very large and comes
directly in contact with the abdominal wall, pushing aside the stomach
and intestines.On auscultation a blowing murmur may, in some instances, be heard over
the tumor.These murmurs are due to pressure upon the aorta, and must
be distinguished from the sound produced in aneurism of this vessel.The various complications of pancreatic disease, such as dilatation of
the stomach, ascites, and secondary lesions of the liver, greatly
modify the physical signs, and sometimes entirely prevent an
exploration of the gland.INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Acute Idiopathic Pancreatitis.It occurs most frequently in males during and
after adult life, and the strumous diathesis appears to predispose to
it.Intemperance, the suppression of normal or morbid discharges, and
traumatism act as exciting causes.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The pathological changes may be divided into
two stages.In the first the gland is deep red in color, intensely
injected with blood, greatly increased in consistence, enlarged to the
extent of two or three times its normal size, and when an incision is
made the divided lobules feel firm and crisp.The interlobular tissue
is sometimes dotted with bloody points, and the same hemorrhagic
changes may occur in the connective tissue surrounding the gland.In
this stage resolution may occur or the inflammation may pass into
suppuration.At the beginning of the second, or suppurative, stage
numerous minute collections of pus are seen scattered throughout the
gland in the interacinous tissue; these gradually collect into a single
large abscess, and at times the whole gland is converted into a mere
pus-sac, the capsule being much thickened.In other instances the
formation of pus is entirely peripancreatic.The pus is usually
inodorous and creamy, but is sometimes grayish-white or greenish in
color; it then has a faint disagreeable odor, and occasionally is very
fetid.When mixed with pancreatic juice it becomes clear and yellowish
in color, and contains numerous minute curd-like masses.In the first stage secondary peritonitis may arise from a simple
extension of the inflammatory process, and bands of lymph are formed,
gluing the pancreas to the neighboring organs.In the second, fatal
acute peritonitis may result from the bursting of an abscess into the
peritoneal cavity.These abscesses also occasionally open into the
duodenum or stomach.Gangrene and peripancreatic sloughing occur very
exceptionally, and are probably due to extensive hemorrhagic changes.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The disease may be preceded for an indefinite
period by symptoms of impaired gastric or intestinal digestion, but its
onset is usually sudden.The attack begins with colic or continuous
{1119} deep-seated pain, starting in the epigastrium and extending
toward the right shoulder or the back, and quickly becoming very
intense.The pain is attended by pallor of the face, great
restlessness, praecordial anxiety, dyspnoea, and faintness.The tongue
is furred or dry and red; thirst is increased; the appetite is lost;
there are frequent eructations, nausea, and constant vomiting of a
clear, greenish, viscid fluid; the vomiting produces no sense of
relief, and even increases the epigastric pain.The bowels are
obstinately constipated.The epigastric region is tense, tumid, and
excessively tender, so that it is usually impossible to elicit the
physical signs of enlargement of the gland.There is moderate pyrexia,
with evening exacerbations, and the pulse is increased in frequency.These symptoms progressively increase in severity, and reach their
maximum intensity in from three to five days.The pulse then becomes
small, compressible, and irregular, the extremities cold, the face
hippocratic, and death takes place in a state of collapse.The fatal
termination is preceded by the symptoms of acute peritonitis in the
cases which are complicated by an extension of inflammation or the
rupture of an abscess into the peritoneal cavity.Recovery is quite possible in the early stage of the disease.On the
other hand, the course may be greatly protracted by a change in the
type of the inflammation, resulting in induration and enlargement of
the gland or in the formation of chronic abscesses.Again, when
peritonitis from extension has been confined solely to the portion of
the peritoneum that covers the gland, and has resulted in the formation
of fibrinous bands binding the pancreas to the adjacent viscera, the
symptoms of pancreatitis will on subsiding give place to those of
obstruction of the stomach, duodenum, or bile-duct.DIAGNOSIS.--The diseases most likely to be confounded with acute
pancreatitis are biliary colic and the catarrhal form of acute
gastritis.From biliary colic it is distinguished by the absence of rigors,
jaundice, enlargement of the liver, and a tender pyriform tumor
corresponding in situation to the gall-bladder and due to its
distension with accumulated bile.The pain in both affections is sudden
in its onset, and very similar in character and distribution; but when
caused by the passage of a gall-stone it usually begins either after a
heavy meal or after some severe muscular exertion or shaking of the
body--circumstances inoperative in the production of the pain of
pancreatitis.The pain, too, in the former condition is less severe at
first, increases gradually in severity, is more paroxysmal, is at the
outset lessened by pressure, and is often temporarily relieved by the
act of vomiting.The attacks at the same time are rarely isolated, and
all doubt is removed when the pain ceases suddenly and a calculus is
discovered in the feces.Acute gastric catarrh is almost always traceable to the ingestion of
some irritant substance, usually alcohol or food of bad quality.This
history, together with the liability of the attack to occur during the
course of chronic dyspepsia, the comparatively trifling severity of the
pain, the headache, the irregularity of the bowels, the condition of
the urine, which is either high- or deposits lithates
abundantly, and the tendency of the affection to become chronic, are
the points of distinction between this and the pancreatic disease.{1120} Acute inflammation of the stomach, or gastritis proper,
resulting from corrosive poisons, presents a train of symptoms entirely
different from those of acute pancreatitis.TREATMENT.--Absolute rest is essential.The diet should consist of milk
guarded by lime-water and of meat-broths, this food being administered
in small quantities--one to two or three fluidounces of the milk and
lime-water or half as much broth--at proper intervals.In the early
stage an effort must be made to reduce the inflammation by the
application of ice to the epigastrium or of leeches to the same region,
or preferably to the anus.The excessive pain demands the free use of
opium.The nausea and vomiting may be relieved to some extent by
directing the patient to swallow small lumps of ice, and by the
employment of iced carbonic-acid water and the effervescing draught;
and the tendency to constipation may be overcome by enemata.Later in
the course of the disease, if the epigastric tenderness permits of it,
light linseed poultices should be placed over the upper abdomen.During
the stage of collapse alcoholic stimulants and the application of heat
to the extremities are necessary.The occurrence of acute peritonitis
or other complications and sequelae demand appropriate treatment.In this condition the pancreas may be the seat of either acute
parenchymatous inflammation or of metastatic abscesses.Acute parenchymatous degeneration of the muscles, kidneys, liver, and
so on is recognized as a frequent lesion in the acute infectious
diseases, particularly typhoid fever; and it is under these
circumstances, and in association always with similar changes in some
of the organs mentioned, that parenchymatous degeneration of the
pancreas takes place.Metastatic suppurative inflammation is very rare: it has been observed
in cases of disease of the testicles after the operation of extirpation
of these organs, and occasionally in puerperal peritonitis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--In parenchymatous inflammation the gland at
first is hardened, swollen, and reddened, and on section presents a
reddish-gray surface, with indistinctness of the glandular structure,
due to the amount of swelling of the acini.Under the microscope the
gland-cells are found to be enlarged; they contain several nuclei,
their protoplasm is infiltrated with fatty granules, obscuring the
nuclei to a certain extent, and their outline is well defined.These
alterations are most marked in the head of the gland.After a time the
hypertrophy of the cells, by pressing upon the blood-vessels, produces
an anaemic condition and the organ becomes pale; in the advanced stages
softening occurs.Metastatic suppurative inflammation leads to the formation of a single
large abscess or to multiple minute purulent collections.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--Parenchymatous degeneration gives rise to no
distinctive symptoms.Its occurrence in typhoid fever or other
infectious disease may be suspected when after prolonged hyperpyrexia
there are enlargement of the liver and spleen and albuminuria.The
appearance of jaundice (from pressure) increases the probability of
involvement of the pancreas in the general gland-change.{1121} The development of rigors, alternating with flushing, during the
course of one of the lesions liable to be attended with metastatic
abscesses in the pancreas might suggest the formation of pus in the
gland, but an absolute diagnosis is impossible.Several cases are on record pointing to the possibility of a metastasis
of mumps from the parotid gland to the pancreas.In these the
disappearance of the parotiditis was followed by symptoms resembling
those of idiopathic pancreatitis--namely, thirst, fever, loss of
appetite, anxiety, and burning in the epigastrium, with deep-seated
pain extending toward the right side; in addition there was diarrhoea,
with numerous, yellowish, watery stools.In one case that resulted
fatally the secondary diarrhoea suddenly ceased and the parotid
swelling reappeared.At the autopsy the pancreas was found to be
swollen, reddened, engorged with blood, and indurated.Such a
metastasis, however, must be very infrequent, and more extended
observations are necessary to establish its course and clinical
features.The first form of acute secondary pancreatitis may be a comparatively
unimportant complication of the acute infectious diseases, or, together
with the parenchymatous degeneration of other organs, may form a
distinct element in the fatal issue of these diseases.Metastatic abscesses are prone to be followed by ulceration and the
formation of fistulous communications with the neighboring viscera.TREATMENT.--The management of secondary inflammation of the pancreas is
regulated solely by the indications derived from the originating
disease.Inflammation of the connective tissue of the gland usually occurs after
adult life, and depends upon a variety of causes.The secondary form, due to long-continued venous engorgement resulting
from lesions of the cardiac valves and from chronic disease of the
lungs or liver, is the most frequently observed.Other causes are closure of the duct of Wirsung, the retained secretion
producing pressure upon the glandular tissue; the extension of
inflammation from adjacent organs, as the bile-duct when there is an
impacted gall-stone, or the stomach and duodenum, especially in cancer
and perforating ulcer, where the floor of the ulcer is formed by the
pancreas; the pressure of tumors, as aneurisms of the abdominal aorta
and coeliac axis; chronic alcoholism; and syphilis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The lesion may be limited to the head or to
isolated portions of the gland, or be uniformly distributed.The
general changes are a hyperplasia of the interacinous connective
tissue, with subsequent contraction and atrophy, or, in extreme
instances, entire destruction of the glandular elements proper, the
organ becoming granular and firmer and tougher than normal.A section
shows a pale surface, studded at intervals with white spots, from which
little cheese-like and fatty masses may be squeezed, and, when there
has been intense hyperaemia, with minute collections of reddish pigment
and small hemorrhagic cysts, indicating previous interstitial
hemorrhages.{1122} When the contraction causes closure of the small excretory ducts
or of the duct of Wirsung itself, the section shows secondary cysts and
beaded canals.In exceptional instances of acquired syphilis the pancreas is the seat
of gummata or sclerosis, but in congenital syphilis hyperplasia of the
glandular connective tissue frequently occurs, being usually associated
with specific lesions of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and general
glandular system.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--As chronic pancreatitis rarely attains a
sufficient degree of development to interfere seriously with the
function of the organ, the disease is usually latent, or masked by the
symptoms of the originating lesion in secondary hyperplasia, or by the
associated diseases of the abdominal viscera in alcoholism and acquired
syphilis.When due to hereditary syphilis, the foetus is stillborn or death takes
place soon after birth, and there are no characteristic symptoms.Occasionally, however, especially when it depends upon a complete
obstruction of the duct of Wirsung, a diagnosis may be made from the
presence of emaciation, fatty stools, and melituria, with epigastric
pain of a neuralgic character, and the discovery of a deep-seated,
dense tumor extending transversely across the epigastrium.The duration is indefinite, and varies greatly with the cause.While a
return to the healthy condition is possible during the early stage of
the lesion, the usual course is similar to that of chronic interstitial
inflammation in other organs.TREATMENT.--The management, when a diagnosis can be made, must be
guided mainly by the etiological indications.The restoration of the
functions of the heart, lungs, or liver when these organs are at fault,
the abstinence from alcohol in the drunkard, and an energetic use of
mercurials or iodide of potassium in syphilis, are of the first
importance in arresting the disease.A persistent course of mild
purgatives and of cathartic mineral waters is serviceable.Pain should
be relieved by belladonna or opium.The diet must be simple and
digestible, and if an arrest of the pancreatic secretion be indicated
by the appearance of fat in the stools, an effort should be made to
supply the deficiency.For this purpose pancreatin, prepared by
precipitation by alcohol from a watery extract of a calf's or pig's
pancreas, may be used.[1] The pancreatin may be given in doses of from
five to fifteen grains, in the form of a pill or in capsules, and at an
interval of two hours after food is taken, or the same quantity of
pancreatin may be added to the food a few moments before it is eaten.Probably the best substitute is a watery infusion of the gland
containing all its soluble principles.To prepare an active infusion
the pancreas must be taken from the animal during the act of digestion.It is then freed from its surrounding fat, and macerated for two hours
in four times its weight of water at a temperature ranging between 25
degrees and 30 degrees C.(58.3 degrees and 61.1 degrees F.).Another
plan is to beat a calf's pancreas in a mortar with six fluidounces of
water until a milk-like fluid is obtained, and strain.One-third of the
infusion obtained by either method is administered after each meal, an
entire pancreas being thus used every twenty-four hours.[Footnote 1: One gramme of pancreatin is sufficient to emulsify fifteen
grammes of fatty substances, to convert eight grammes of starch into
glucose, to digest fifty grammes of fibrin, twenty grammes of
syntonine, and thirty-three grammes of boiled albumen (Raymond).]{1123} The extractum pancreatis,[2] as it is now furnished to the
profession, is a very useful preparation.It may be employed to
peptonize milk, milk-gruel, and broth, or be given in combination with
bicarbonate of sodium at a fixed interval after each meal, as in the
following formula:

  Rx.pancreatis,    drachm j;
      Sodii bicarbonatis, drachm ij;
  M. et.S. One powder to be taken two hours after each meal.[Footnote 2: That prepared by Fairchild Brothers & Foster of New York
has proved the best in my hands.]Peptonized milk is prepared by putting into a clean quart bottle 5
grains of extractum pancreatis, 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
a gill of cool water; shake, and add a pint of fresh cool milk.Place
the bottle in water not so hot but that the whole hand can be held in
it without discomfort for a minute, and keep the bottle there for
exactly thirty minutes.At the end of that time put the bottle on ice
to check further digestion and keep the milk from spoiling.Peptonized milk-gruel is made of equal parts of any farinaceous gruel
and fresh cold milk.To a pint of this combination 5 grains of
extractum pancreatis and 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium are added,
and the whole allowed to stand in a warm place for thirty minutes, when
the process of digestion must be arrested by placing on ice.Peptonized broth is made in the following way: Take one-fourth of a
pound of finely-minced raw lean beef or mutton or chicken, and one-half
pint of cold water; cook over a slow fire, stirring constantly, until
it has boiled a few minutes.Then pour off the liquor, beat the meat to
a paste, and put both into a bottle with a half pint of cold water.Add
30 grains of extractum pancreatis and 20 grains of bicarbonate of
sodium; shake well, and set in a warm place (110-115 degrees) for three
hours, shaking occasionally; then boil quickly.Finally, strain or
clarify in the usual way and season to taste.MORBID GROWTHS OF THE PANCREAS.Cancer is probably the most common of the chronic affections of the
pancreas.It is usually secondary, being due to an extension of
carcinoma of the stomach, duodenum, liver, or abdominal lymphatic
glands, but there are enough cases on record to show that it may be
primary.It has been discovered in the foetus at birth, but the vast
majority of cases occur after the age of forty.Nothing is known as to the influence of inherited
tendency in the production of the disease, and as little of the
exciting causes, though some authors attach much importance to
prolonged pressure upon the epigastrium and to blows and contusions on
the upper part of the abdomen.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--Primary carcinoma may be either {1124}
scirrhous, encephaloid, or colloid, the first being the variety most
frequently observed.The lesion begins in the head of the gland in the form of several small
nodules which gradually coalesce.Sometimes the whole gland becomes
involved in the new formation; again, isolated nodules may be scattered
throughout its substance, and exceptionally the growth is limited to
the tail or middle portion.When the head alone is involved, the
remainder of the gland either remains healthy, undergoes fatty
degeneration, or becomes indurated.The tumor is rounded in outline and
nodular, and varies in size, density, and color according to the form
of carcinoma present.The duct of Wirsung is ordinarily obstructed,
large retention cysts, containing a yellowish-red liquid, are formed,
and the changes already described under the head of Chronic
Interstitial Pancreatitis take place in those portions of the gland
which are free from carcinoma.The disease is very prone to extend to
the surrounding organs, particularly the neighboring lymphatic glands,
the duodenum, and the liver, rarely to the stomach.When the contiguous
organs are not directly implicated in the carcinomatous changes, they
are subjected to pressure by the tumor, and in the case of the stomach
and duodenum adhesions often form, and are followed by perforation.There seems to be a tendency also to infiltration of the adjacent
subperitoneal connective tissue and to hyperplasia of the fibrous
tissue of the viscera, even when they are not secondarily involved in
the morbid growth, leading to narrowing of the aorta, thickening of the
walls of the stomach and duodenum, and a sclerosis of the liver.Obstruction of the common bile-duct, with dilatation of the
gall-bladder from retention of bile, is a frequent result of the
disease.Secondary carcinoma of the pancreas usually first appears in, and is
limited to, the head of the gland.It seldom occurs in isolated
nodules, but the growth is generally continuous with the primary
cancerous mass.The form is either scirrhous or encephaloid.Wagner
records a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma following a simple
epithelioma of the mucous membrane of the duodenum; and a similar
instance has come under the author's own observation;[3] but this
variety of morbid growth is rare.The primary growth is almost
uniformly situated in the stomach, duodenum, liver, or gall-bladder,
though occasionally it may be seated in some distant organ; in such
cases the pancreatic tumor appears as an isolated nodular mass.[Footnote 3: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of
Philadelphia_, vol.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The symptoms may be divided into two
classes--namely, first, those which arise from the lesion of the gland
itself; and, secondly, those which depend upon the effect of this
lesion on the neighboring viscera.The features belonging to the first class are general marasmus, pain,
the appearance of fat and perhaps undigested muscular fibres in the
fecal evacuations and of fat in the urine, and the physical signs of an
abdominal tumor.Loss of flesh is one of the earliest symptoms: it is generally
progressive, and is at times so great that the spine can be distinctly
traced through the abdominal walls.Together with this emaciation there
is debility, often extreme, but sometimes not so marked as might be
expected from the degree of wasting.The skin is commonly pale and dry,
and before jaundice is {1125} developed has the ordinary sallow hue of
cancerous cachexia.The features are pinched, and the face wears an
expression of anxiety and suffering.In cases uncomplicated by
peritoneal inflammation the temperature remains about normal, or it may
be lowered as the general exhaustion increases.The pulse is feeble and
slightly increased in frequency.Pain is the most uniformly present and the earliest symptom.It is
always situated deep in the epigastrium, and from thence extends to the
back, to the right or left side, downward to the umbilicus or lower
part of the abdomen, and upward into the chest.It is generally
continuous, but is subject to remissions and paroxysmal exacerbations.During the remissions sensations of distress, of burning, or of dull
pain are experienced at the pit of the stomach; during the
exacerbations, which may last several days, the pain becomes extremely
acute and lancinating and extended in distribution.The ingestion of
food and pressure upon the epigastrium have no constant effect upon the
pain.Quick movements of the body from side to side often increase it
and excite exacerbations.The suffering is greatest in the erect
posture, and on this account the patient bends his body forward so as
to relax the abdominal muscles.The paroxysmal and neuralgic character
of the pain indicates implication of the coeliac plexus.The appearance of fat in the stools is an important symptom, unless
there be at the same time an obstruction to the passage of bile into
the duodenum, indicated by jaundice.Lipuria has been noticed in a few
cases only.In many instances (nearly one-half of the number of recorded cases)
physical exploration reveals the signs of enlargement of the organ.At
times there is merely a sense of fulness and resistance to the touch,
and a modified tympanitic percussion note in one of the three regions
of the upper segment of the abdomen.But usually when a tumor is
present it is readily mapped out by palpation.The tumor is seated in
the epigastrium, and may extend into the right or left hypochondrium or
downward into the umbilical region.It varies much in size, is rounded,
nodulated, firm, slightly movable or fixed, and tender, though
sometimes painless, to the touch.Percussion yields dulness or a
dull-tympanitic sound.On auscultation a blowing murmur may be heard
when the tumor presses upon the aorta; and when this murmur is present
there is usually also transmitted pulsation.The symptoms belonging to the second class arise when the adjacent
viscera become involved in the cancerous disease, or when their
functional activity is disturbed by the encroachment and pressure of
the enlarged pancreas.From the association of a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane of
the stomach, particularly when the pyloric orifice is obstructed,
several prominent symptoms of gastric catarrh are frequently
observed--namely, sialorrhoea, pyrosis, acid eructations, flatulence,
abnormal sensations, such as burning, weight and oppression in the
epigastrium after taking food, and increased thirst.The tongue varies
in appearance: it may be dry and covered with a brown or yellow fur,
but when the flow of saliva is increased it is peculiarly clean and
moist; and this condition is rather characteristic.The appetite is
also variable; sometimes it remains good {1126} until the end, and
occasionally it is perverted.Hiccough in some cases is an obstinate
and annoying symptom.Nausea and vomiting are late but moderately constant features.Their
relation to the ingestion of food is not fixed.The vomited matter may
consist of food, of glairy mucus more or less tinged with bile, of
colorless liquid, or of a fluid resembling a mixture of bran and water.If there is marked pyloric obstruction with dilatation of the stomach,
large quantities of frothy and fermenting material containing sarcina
ventriculi are rejected at intervals.In the rare cases in which
secondary sarcoma of the viscus is developed the ejecta are bloody or
have the coffee-ground appearance, and the vomiting occurs several
hours after eating, as the new growth is generally situated at the
pylorus.When there is adhesion of the pancreatic tumor to the stomach,
with perforation, both blood and pus are vomited.Dilatation of the
stomach is attended by prominence of the epigastrium and an extended
area of gastric tympany, and in cancer of the pylorus a tumor is often
appreciable on palpation.The fecal
evacuations are hard, and when the biliary secretion is absent from the
intestine they are clay-, and often contain fat.When there is
ulceration of the mucous membrane of the duodenum following secondary
cancer or adhesion, the stools become black and tar-like from the
presence of altered blood.Complete obstipation occurs in mechanical
obstruction of the gut from direct pressure or from bands of lymph.Occasionally, just before death there is diarrhoea, and there may be an
alternation of vomiting and diarrhoea.The symptoms and signs of secondary carcinoma or sclerosis of the liver
may be present, but the most commonly observed indications of impaired
hepatic function depend upon pressure-obstruction of the common
bile-duct.These are jaundice, fatty and clay- stools, and the
appearance of a tumor in the region of the gall-bladder.Jaundice is a
very common symptom.It occurs late in the disease as a rule, is
progressive and persistent, resisting all treatment, and is extreme in
degree, the skin becoming deep-yellow or greenish in color.The tumor
of the distended gall-bladder is pyriform in shape, firm and elastic to
the touch, yields a dull percussion sound, and occupies a position
opposite the extremity of the tenth rib on the right side of the
abdomen.Dropsy occurs in a large proportion of cases (nearly one-half) during
the advanced stages of the disease.It is due to vascular obstruction
occasioned by the pressure of the enlarged pancreas itself or of the
secondarily degenerated coeliac glands, and finally by secondary
lesions of the liver.The dropsy appears either in the form of ascites
or anasarca, is not often extreme in degree, and is subject to
variations, disappearing and reappearing at intervals.Ascites is the
more common form, but both conditions may exist in the same patient.It is impossible in the majority of instances to definitely fix the
date of onset of a pancreatic cancer, but the average duration of the
disease may be stated to be about one year.The uniformly fatal
termination usually takes place slowly from gradual exhaustion or with
the symptoms of an adynamic fever, but death may occur suddenly from
hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The principal features of carcinoma of the pancreas are
extreme emaciation, loss of strength, dyspepsia, pain of a neuralgic
{1127} character in the epigastrium, constipation, obstinate jaundice,
moderate ascites or anasarca, the appearance of fat in the stools,
lipuria, occasional vomiting, and the physical signs of an epigastric
tumor.These symptoms are not pathognomonic, however, and the diagnosis can be
certainly established only when it is possible to exclude primary
disease of the surrounding organs, especially of the stomach and liver.Cancer of the stomach may be excluded by the less-marked character of
the functional disturbances of the viscus; by the absence of frequent
vomiting, haematemesis, and the rejection of coffee-ground material; by
the somewhat different situation and greater immobility of the tumor,
by the seat, distribution, and constancy of the pain; and by the
presence of jaundice and of fat in the stools and urine.Diseases of the liver attended with alterations in the size of the
organ, as cancer, abscess, albuminoid and fatty degeneration, sclerosis
and hydatid tumor, have sufficiently characteristic physical signs and
symptoms to be readily distinguished from cancer of the pancreas.On
the other hand, the tumor of an enlarged gall-bladder is often
confusing.The situation of this tumor opposite the tenth rib and its
pyriform shape are important; other distinguishing points depend upon
the cause of the enlargement.In enlargement from accumulated bile the
tumor is elastic and fluctuating; from accumulation of gall-stones,
hard and nodulated, movable, painless on palpation, and often the seat
of crackling fremitus, produced by manipulation and due to the rubbing
together of several calculi; from cancer, hard, nodular, the size of an
orange, tender on pressure, rapid in growth, preceded by attacks of
biliary colic, and attended by fistulous communications with the
intestines and the passage of gall-stones per anum.In aneurism of the aorta or coeliac axis the tumor may present in the
epigastrium and produce analogous pressure symptoms.But the pain is
more of the character described as wearing, and is usually augmented at
night: on grasping the tumor a uniform expanding pulsation is felt in
place of the to-and-fro movement appreciable in a tumor resting upon a
healthy blood-vessel and receiving a transmitted impulse, while the
constitutional symptoms and course are quite different.The tumor of malignant disease of the omentum, although it appears in
the epigastrium or upper part of the umbilical region, is much more
movable, and is accompanied by ill-defined symptoms very dissimilar to
those of pancreatic cancer.In cancer of the transverse colon the mass may occupy nearly the same
position as a pancreatic growth, but the pain occurs several hours
after food is taken; vomiting is absent, and there is frequently
hemorrhage from the bowels.Chronic pancreatitis is accompanied by symptoms simulating those of
cancer; the enlargement of the gland, however, is not so great, nor are
the indications of pressure upon adjacent organs so prominent.The pain
is less severe, the general failure in health more gradual, the
progress slower, and constipation less common.TREATMENT.--The indications are to maintain the strength of the
patient, to provide a diet that is nutritious and at the same time
easily digested, to allay pain by the employment of narcotics, and to
relieve as far as possible the various symptoms as they arise.The plan
of {1128} administering a calf's pancreas or extractum pancreatis will
prove serviceable when the fecal evacuations contain fat.Nutritious
and peptonized enemata may be of service in some cases.Sarcoma and Tubercle of the Pancreas.Sarcoma of the pancreas occurs with extreme rarity.It is impossible
during life to distinguish it from carcinoma.Tubercle of the gland is infrequently met with.Some pathologists deny
its occurrence, and believe that the cases recorded as such are merely
instances of caseous degeneration of the neighboring glands.When it
does occur, it is always secondary, the primary disease being situated
in the lungs or intestines.The alterations in the gland consist in the
development of cheesy masses or of miliary granulations in the
connective tissue between the acini.The condition gives rise to no
definite symptoms, and its diagnosis during life is impossible.DEGENERATIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Two forms of fatty degeneration occur, either separately or
combined--namely, fatty infiltration and fatty metamorphosis.Fatty infiltration consists of a true hypertrophy of the fat-tissue
normally existing in the gland, or of an increase and extension into
the gland of the peripancreatic adipose tissue.Yellow bands and masses
of fat-tissue appear between the acini, and by constantly increasing in
size lead gradually to a total atrophy of the cells of the acini.The
canal of Wirsung contains a fatty liquid.These changes are found
associated with fatty liver, heart, and omentum, in drunkards
especially.Fatty metamorphosis of the gland consists of a change analogous to
fatty metamorphosis of other organs.When hyperplasia of the
interstitial connective tissue is absent, the organ is flaccid, soft,
and diminished in size; the acinous structure remains distinct, though
the acini and ducts are filled with a fatty emulsion: after this is
discharged or absorbed the gland appears as a flaccid band, and finally
becomes entirely atrophied.Fatty metamorphosis occurs in drunkards, in
diabetes, in advanced age, in cancer, phthisis, and other wasting
diseases.Neither form of fatty disease gives rise to symptoms by which it can be
recognized during life.Albuminoid Degeneration of the Pancreas.This is only found in combination with amyloid change in other organs
of the body, and a diagnosis cannot be made.{1129} Hemorrhages into the Pancreas.Hemorrhages into the pancreas may be divided into three classes.The most common form depends upon passive hyperaemia, the result of
chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, or liver.In this condition the
effusion of blood coexists with chronic inflammatory changes in the
interstitial connective tissue.The appearance at first is of minute
bloody points scattered throughout the areolar tissue; later, these
change into round or oval pigment masses, or spaces containing reddish
serum and surrounded by thickened, rust-, irregular walls.The second class includes the rare cases of hemorrhage resulting from
the rupture of one of the large blood-vessels of the gland, and due to
some pre-existing change in the vessel walls.In these the pancreas is
enlarged, may be converted into a sac containing blood, either fluid or
coagulated or partially crystallized according to the duration of life
after the hemorrhage has taken place, and a ruptured blood-vessel may
be readily discovered on dissection.The condition in which, without any evidence of passive hyperaemia or
gross vascular lesion, the entire pancreas become hemorrhagic,
constitutes the third class.The gland is then dark-red or violet in
color, the meshes of the interstitial tissue are filled with recent or
altered blood, and the acini are stained of a dull-gray hue.The
hemorrhage may extend to the connective tissue surrounding the gland.Finally, the organ becomes soft, the peritoneal covering sloughs, and
fragments of broken-down gland-tissue escape into the peritoneal
cavity.These lesions are so analogous to those which attend thrombosis
occurring in other organs that their dependence upon the same cause
seems probable.The first form of hemorrhage is unattended by special symptoms.In the
second a pulsating tumor may suddenly appear in the epigastrium, and
the ordinary indications of hemorrhage--vomiting, fainting fits, cold
extremities, feeble pulse, and general exhaustion--are present.Death
may occur suddenly or the patient may linger on for months.In the
third condition death usually occurs very suddenly, probably from
pressure upon the sympathetic ganglia.There are no symptoms, and the
rapid termination prevents the development of general peritonitis,
which would otherwise occur from the sloughing of the peritoneum.OBSTRUCTION OF THE PANCREATIC DUCT.Obstruction of the excretory duct is a frequent occurrence in
pancreatic disease, and is due to two classes of causes--namely, 1st,
pressure from without; and, 2d, closure of the canal by catarrhal
swelling of its mucous membrane or by calculi.In the first class may be placed obstruction depending upon contraction
occurring in sclerosis of the gland, upon carcinoma of the head of the
gland, upon peripancreatic adhesions and indurations, upon the {1130}
presence of large gall-stones in the ductus choledochus, and upon
carcinoma of the pylorus and duodenum and enlargement of the
neighboring lymphatic glands.In catarrh of the canal of Wirsung the obstruction results either from
simple swelling of the mucous membrane or from the presence of a plug
of tough mucus.The formation of pancreatic concretions is by no means a rare event,
though these calculi are met with far less frequently than either
gall-stones or salivary concretions.They result from precipitation of
the inorganic ingredients of the pancreatic juice, and are usually
seated in the main duct, although they may be situated in the smaller
branches.They may be single or multiple, as many as twenty having been
counted in one gland.In shape they are spherical, oval, or branched,
with sometimes a smooth, at others a spiculated, surface; their size
varies from that of a minute granule to a small walnut; they are
usually white or grayish-white in color, but may be black; and are
composed of the carbonate of lime or of a combination of the carbonate
and phosphate with oxalate of lime.Coincidently with these calculi it
is common to find concretions in the kidneys and gall-bladder.Concretions composed of insoluble protein substances have also been
found in the pancreatic ducts (Virchow).The most probable causes of the formation of pancreatic calculi seem to
be catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane of the ducts and an
alteration in the chemical composition of the secretion.Whatever the cause, the obstruction, when complete, leads to retention
of the secretion and the formation of retention cysts.When the obstruction is situated at the duodenal extremity of the duct,
the canal and its secondary branches are either uniformly dilated or
sacculi are formed.These sacculi are round or oval, vary greatly in
size, sometimes reaching the dimensions of the fist or of a child's
head; they may be single, or several of them may be present, differing
in size and causing irregular projections of the outer surface of the
gland.When the obstruction occurs at some point in the course of the
duct, the dilatations and sacculi are found only behind the point of
occlusion.The small cysts contain a fluid resembling the pancreatic
juice; the larger, a whitish, chalky fluid, which in old cases may
contain white friable concretions composed of carbonate and phosphate
of lime, and become purulent, or be stained bright red or
chocolate- from the occurrence of hemorrhage.In such instances
haematoidin crystals can be discovered by the microscope.The interior
of the dilated ducts and of the retention cysts is lined by a single
layer of thin flat cells, with irregular edges and with oval flat
nuclei.The walls are thickened, and composed of superimposed layers of
laminated connective tissue separated from one another by flat
nucleated cells.The secreting structure of the gland undergoes atrophy
from pressure, or fatty metamorphosis takes place, and, although the
gland is increased in size from the presence of the cysts, its
functional power is lost.In addition to causing obstruction of the duct of Wirsung and the
changes mentioned, pancreatic calculi may produce induration, atrophy,
acute inflammation, or even suppuration of the surrounding glandular
tissue.{1131} SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The main feature is the presence in the
epigastrium of a rounded, smooth, fluctuating, painless tumor.There
are also indications of the absence of the pancreatic secretion from
the digestive tract--notably, emaciation, general debility, and the
appearance of fat in the stools.Jaundice resulting from a coincident
obstruction of the bile-duct is a frequent symptom, and melituria has
been noted in some cases.It is probable, too, that the passage of a
calculus along the duct may give rise to pain resembling in character
and distribution the pain of hepatic colic.Sometimes the termination is sudden from
the rupture of a cyst into the peritoneal cavity or into the stomach or
duodenum, with hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The absence of pain, of tenderness, and of cachexia,
together with the physical characters of the tumor, distinguishes it
from carcinoma of the gland.Though not likely to be confounded with this disease, both hydatid
tumor of the liver and distension of the gall-bladder must be borne in
mind in making the diagnosis of a fluctuating tumor situated in the
upper third of the abdomen.TREATMENT must be entirely symptomatic.Attention to the general
health, proper regulation of the diet, and the employment of pancreatin
or an infusion of calf's pancreas to supply the place of the deficient
pancreatic juice, are the important steps.Attacks of pancreatic colic
indicate the use of anodynes.In two reported cases in which the cysts were very large paracentesis
for the removal of the fluid contents was resorted to, and there are
two cases on record in which the cysts were extirpated after abdominal
section.Kulenhampff of Bremen records a case of a man, thirty-nine
years of age, in whom, after a succession of severe blows upon the
abdomen, a tumor appeared in the epigastrium.An exploratory incision
was made, and a few ounces of pancreatic fluid evacuated by aspiration.Six days afterward the abdomen was opened, the peritoneum united to the
incision, and antiseptic gauze inserted to produce adhesive
inflammation between the sac and the abdominal wall.Adhesion taking
place after four days, the cyst was opened, a liter of fluid evacuated,
a tent inserted, and an antiseptic dressing applied.For sixteen days
fluid constantly escaped in slowly diminishing quantities, and the
tumor disappeared, a fistulous tract remaining.This completely closed
under the use of tincture of iodine and nitrate of silver at the end of
the seventh week.Thiersch opened a pancreatic cyst and evacuated three
liters of chocolate- fluid; recovery with a fistula followed.From a patient supposed to be suffering from ovarian dropsy Rokitansky
partially extirpated a cyst connected with the tail of the pancreas;
death from suppurative peritonitis occurred on the tenth day.N. Bozeman[4] on December 2, 1880, successfully removed from a woman
forty-one years old a pancreatic cyst weighing, with its contents,
twenty and a half pounds.In this instance also the operation was
undertaken for the removal of a supposed ovarian tumor, the diagnosis
not being established until after the abdomen was opened.[Footnote 4: _New York Medical Record_, Jan.{1132}

PERITONITIS.BY ALONZO CLARK, M.D., LL.D.Italian physicians in the later years of the seventeenth century and in
the early ones of the eighteenth had acquired some knowledge of the
symptoms of the disease we now call peritonitis, but known to them as
inflammation of the intestines.Indeed, it is claimed by some of the
admirers of Hippocrates that there are passages in his writings that
indicate some knowledge of the disease.But this claim will probably be
always received with many doubts as to its validity.In confirmation of the first statement I will transcribe certain
passages from Morgagni's thirty-fifth letter: In inflammation of the
intestines "Albertini had observed the pulse to be low and rather weak,
such as you will find it to have been in general in the foregoing
letter under Nos.He also observed the abdomen to
be tense and hard, the face and eyes to have something unusual in their
appearance."Medical writers, indeed, agree in the tension of the
abdomen, but they add many other symptoms, which prove beyond a doubt
the intestines to be inflamed; yet they mean that evident inflammation
which all may easily ascertain, and not that obscure disorder which we
now speak of, and which few suspect" (gangrene of the intestines)."By
the same writers it is also supposed that there is an obstinate
costiveness and continual vomiting."Morgagni refers to the assistance rendered by Albertini, Valsala, Van
Swieten, Rosa, and others in elucidating this subject.It is singular,
considering the clearness of his perception of the symptoms of
inflammation of the intestines, that he should be so greatly confused
regarding gangrene and sphacelus of the same parts.He looks on these
as the result of inflammation, and when the two classes of cases are
considered and compared, the result is a contrast and not a
resemblance.Yet he supposes that the differences are to be accounted
for by the different modes in which the same disease may be developed
in different persons.Another thing obtrudes itself on the attention in these letters: that
while a number of post-mortem examinations are reported of those who
had died of inflammation of the intestines, of gangrene and sphacelus
of the intestines, of hepatic abscess opening into the peritoneal
cavity, there is no record of finding in the abdomen anything
corresponding to what is now known as the inflammatory effusions from
serous membranes.I have searched his works, not for {1133}
peritonitis, for the word was not in use in his day, but for some
account of inflammation of the intestines or of some disease in the
description of which symptoms are named that distinguish or belong to
peritonitis, and with the single exception of pain the search has been
fruitless.Cullen in 1775 mentions the disease, but says that so little is known
about it that he will not attempt a description of it.Bichat died in 1802 in the thirty-eighth year of his age.I am not able
at present to lay my hand on his _Pathological Anatomy_; I therefore
quote from Chomel's article on peritonitis in the _Dictionnaire de
Medecine_ to show his claim to important studies regarding that
disease: "For a long time peritonitis was confounded under the name of
inflammation du bas ventre with inflammations of the abdominal viscera;
and it is to Bichat belongs the merit of having proved that
inflammation of the peritoneum is a disease distinct, and that it ought
to be separated from enteritis, gastritis, etc., as pleurisy is
separate from pneumonia.The studies of Gasc and of Laennec soon
confirmed the opinion of Bichat, and assured to peritonitis the
important place which it ought to occupy in all nosological tables.It
has become since then a subject of numerous observations and of
interesting researches regarding the causes de sa marche and the
lesions it causes."The references are not given by Chomel, but they are probably these:
Laennec, _Histoire des Inflammations du Peritoine_, 1804; and Gasc,
_Dictionnaire des Sciences Med._, p.Gasc says that the twenty years next preceding his publication
witnessed the first stage of the true history of peritonitis.Walther
in 1786 had contributed some facts, and S. G. Vogel in 1795, but the
rounding off and completing their work was left for Bichat.MORBID ANATOMY.--The first thing that strikes the observer in the
post-mortem examination of a person who has died of this disease is the
tendency of the intestines to protrude through the cut made in the
abdominal wall.This is produced by their dilatation generally, both
small and large, by gas.No gas, under these circumstances, ever
escapes from the peritoneal cavity unless there has been perforation of
the alimentary canal somewhere.While the intestines are in this manner
dilated, the stomach is small and usually empty.On the surface of the intestines there will be found a layer of
coagulated fibrin, often very thin and delicate, requiring a scraping
of the surface of the peritoneum to demonstrate it, but commonly
obvious enough, and sometimes quite abundant.This same false membrane
can be found on the viscera covered by the peritoneal membrane, on its
anterior extension, and most at the point of contact of one coil of the
intestine with another.Incorporated with this new membrane or lying
under it will often be seen blood-spots, thin, translucent, diffused,
and having ill-defined boundaries.The blood-vessels themselves are not remarkably congested.Here and
there may be spots where some redness remains, and the vessels are
larger than natural.But the congestion and redness, which analogy
leads us to {1134} believe belong to the active stages of the disease,
have in great degree disappeared after death.The peritoneal membrane itself has hardly become thickened, certainly
not in marked degree, but it has lost its lustrous surface, is, at
least in parts, of an opaline color, as if it had absorbed diluted
milk, and there is an effusion of serum or slight oedema on its
attached surface.Whatever may be the popular opinion regarding the
termination of inflammation of the bowels in mortification, whatever
the opinion of the older physicians, it is safe to say that gangrene of
the peritoneum has never been the result of uncomplicated, diffuse,
acute peritonitis.Peritonitis from strangulation of the intestine or
analogous causes is of course excepted.But in puerperal peritonitis I
have noticed a fact to which I have nowhere seen an allusion.The
parietal peritoneum is at two points in the abdomen but loosely
attached to the wall.One of these is on the anterior wall, anterior to
and a little above the iliac fossa; the other is above and below the
kidney on each side of the body.In these parts I have seen the
membrane forced off from its attachment to the walls, which with it
made a sac containing pus.Such an abscess, if the patient live long
enough, would doubtless cause the death of the membrane.There is in almost every case of peritonitis more or less of serous
effusion, commonly not seen at first on opening the abdomen, for it has
sunk into the pelvis.It is transparent, of a yellowish hue, and
sometimes flocculi of lymph are found in it.Whether the inflammation of the peritoneum extends to organs covered by
it is a question that has been much discussed; but it is admitted that
these organs, to a shallow depth on their surface, have an unnatural
color; and when it is remembered that the peritoneum is nourished by
vessels not exclusively its own, but running along its attached
surface, and distributed as well to the surface of the organs it
covers, it is easy to admit that to a very limited depth the organs
partake of the inflammatory disease.This supposition gives an easy
explanation of the constipation which is so prominent a feature among
the symptoms of the disease.The manner in which the false membrane is disposed of in those who
recover is an interesting question.Forty or more years ago Vogel
described the process by which the new effusion became a living tissue,
and the manner in which blood-corpuscles and blood-vessels were formed
in it; and another author had found that the time needed to complete
this vascularization was twenty days.But now Bauer and most of the
German writers inform us that the coagulated fibrin is converted into
fatty matter and is absorbed, and that when adhesions occur they result
from the coalescence of a new formation of the connective-tissue
elements built up into granules.The question, then, arises, Will the
chemical constitution of fibrin permit its conversion into oil?If it
will, then the further question presents itself, By what chemical
action is the change effected within the body?I do not intend to
discuss these questions, but propose them by way of expressing some
doubt regarding the accuracy of this statement.I have always supposed that the epithelial layer of the peritoneum was
pushed off by the first of the effusions in peritonitis, and that this
was one of the causes of the lustreless appearance of the membrane.This {1135} opinion I have never attempted to confirm or correct by the
microscope.He says: "The deposition of
fibrin occurs before the endothelium presents any changes.This
fibrinous effusion encloses, primarily, hardly any cellular elements,
and only a few cast-off endothelial cells are to be found in it.The
endothelium itself is swollen and turbid; the cell-body is increased in
size; the contents are granular; multiplication of the nuclei is
apparent; the cells are, in fact, in active division.In the tissue of
the serous membrane itself, soon after the deposition on its surface,
an accumulation of indifferent (?)cells takes place, especially around
the vessels, so that the spaces between the vessels are thus completely
filled up.The fixed connective-tissue corpuscles take part in the
inflammatory process."Delafield says: "If the autopsy is made within a few hours after death,
we find the entire peritoneum of a bright-red color from congestion of
the blood-vessels; but that is all: there is no fibrin, no serum, no
pus; epithelial cells are increased in size and number."For this kind
of peritonitis he proposes the term cellular.He finds it in cases of
local abscess of the abdominal cavity in which inflammatory action has
extended over the whole membrane, and particularly on the omentum also,
in the first two days of puerperal peritonitis."The ordinary form of
acute peritonitis is attended with changes in the endothelium and fixed
connective tissue, and with the production of serum, fibrin, and pus."He describes the migration of white corpuscles of the blood through the
walls of capillaries to become pus-cells, and then says: "Minute
examination shows that two distinct sets of changes are going on at the
same time: first, a production of fibrin, serum, and pus; second,
swelling and multiplication of the endothelial cells.If the
inflammation is very intense, the pus and fibrin are most abundant; if
milder, the changes in the endothelium are more marked."I have said above that the epithelium is early washed off by the
inflammatory effusions.In opposition--or, perhaps better, in
correction--of this idea, Delafield says: "There may be a considerable
amount of pus produced, and yet the layer of endothelium remains in
place.""If, however, the pus and fibrin are produced in large amounts,
the endothelium falls off and leaves the surface of the peritoneum
bare."The connective-tissue cells of peritoneum, he says, undergo but
little change in the first three days of the inflammation, "but by the
seventh day these cells are marked by increase in size and number in
all parts of the peritoneum."Two or three times in my life I have met with a peculiar arrangement of
the false membrane and serum of peritoneal inflammation, of which I do
not remember to have seen a description.It is this: the serum is
enclosed or encysted in bladders, the walls of which are the false
membrane.There may be two or three layers of these bladders, one upon
another, all more or less flattened, and each holding from two to six
ounces of fluid.It would seem that in these cases the inflammatory
activity rose and fell in its progress, early reaching the point at
which coagulable lymph was effused, then falling to the stage in which
serum alone escaped.This serum lifted the false membrane irregularly,
so that several pools were formed.After this the inflammation returns
to the fibrous exudation stage, and gives to these bladders a floor
which blends with the {1136} roof at the edges, and thus makes a
complete sac.Once more the inflammatory action is changed in its
intensity, so that the only effusion is serum; and this serum again
raises the new layer of false membrane into bladders--not always or
generally in the exact position of the first series.Still again, the
inflammation may be so changed as to make a fibrinous flow to this
second series of bladders.I am not certain that I have seen a third
series of these rare productions.They have doubtless been seen by
other persons, and may have been described.I have not been an
exhaustive reader on the subject, but I can well understand how they
may have been called hydatids on examination of the sacs without
looking at the contents.The fluid in the cysts is simply serum, with
no echinococcus sacs, and then the number of these inflammatory sacs
greatly exceeds the probable number of the fibrous sacs of hydatids.Pus in large quantity is not often a product of simple acute diffusive
peritonitis, although it is frequently found in that form of the
disease that attends puerperal fever, septicaemia, or erysipelas.Yet I
have seen it a few times.The pus is not generally pure, but is mixed
with serum in different proportions, and there will be seen at the same
time deposits of lymph attached to the peritoneum or scales of it
floating in the fluid effusion, or both.There is reason to believe
that in the cases of this class a very large proportion are fatal in
the acute stages, but in the cases that live for a few weeks the pus is
disposed to collect in pools and become abscesses by adhesions around
them at their borders.These abscesses are disposed to find an exit
from the body.In one case four abscesses that were found in this way
in different parts of the abdominal cavity had each burrowed toward the
umbilicus, and were actually discharging their contents at this point
when I saw the case.In another case one abscess only was formed, and
in four weeks it had perforated the colon.The opening was nearly an
inch in diameter.Kalantarians says, in eight examinations of the solar and hypogastric
plexus in persons who had died of acute peritonitis changes which he
regards as inflammatory had occurred, with subsequent opaque swelling
of the nerve-cells, ultimate fatty degeneration, brown pigmentation,
and atrophy.In chronic peritonitis the cells are often converted into
amorphous pigment matter, with increase and sclerosis of the ganglionic
connective tissue.Still, it is worthy of notice that these changes do
not express themselves in symptoms in those that recover.ETIOLOGY.--Numerous writers have expressed a doubt whether a
spontaneous acute peritonitis ever occurs, or if it is ever primary its
occurrence in this way is very rare.Habershon[1] has presented the
case with more apparent force than any other writer.He studied the
record of five hundred autopsies of peritonitis made at Guy's Hospital
during twenty-five years, but he "cannot find a single case thoroughly
detailed where the disease could be correctly regarded as existing
solely in the peritoneal serous membrane."[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chirurgical Trans._, vol.In twenty-five years
the records were probably made by a number of different persons, and
persons of varying views and varying capacity and judgment.It is
possible that the quotation may embrace some of the changes already
referred to as the consequences of peritonitis.It does embrace the
cases {1137} "when inflammation of the serous membrane occurs in the
course of albuminuria, pyaemia, puerperal fever, erysipelas, etc."It
also includes "peritonitis caused by general nutritive changes in the
system," as seen "in struma, cancer, etc.," "comprising also those
cases in which the circulation of the peritoneum has been so altered by
continued hyperaemia (modifying its state of growth) that very slight
existing causes suffice to excite mischief, as in peritonitis with
cirrhosis, disease of the heart, etc."With these explanations the statement differs widely from what it would
seem to mean without them.It is far from saying that peritonitis
always follows some abdominal lesion and is caused by that lesion.Habershon's paper was published twenty-three years ago, and during all
these years the curative treatment of peritonitis, to which the paper
itself gave currency, has enabled us to study our cases after recovery
as well as before the sickness, and it can hardly be doubted that a
much larger proportion of the cases are primary and idiopathic than
either Louis or Habershon found reason to admit.That a large number
are produced by preceding lesions and constitutional conditions no one
will be likely to doubt.Among the 500 post-mortem examinations of peritonitis reported by
Habershon, he found preceding disease or injury recognizable in the
abdominal cavity in 261.:

  From hernia, of which 19 were internal obstruction.35
  From perforation of the stomach, ileum, caecum and appendix,
    colon, etc.(other 13 mentioned with hernia, or with caecal
    disease).43
  And leading to fecal abscess (2 otherwise mentioned).17
  From typhoid ulceration without perforation .5
  From disease or operation on bladder and pelvis, viscera, etc.42
  From disease of the liver and gall-bladder.11
  From acute disease of the colon (3 others enumerated with
    perforation).3
  From disease of the caecum or appendix (9 others previously
    mentioned).3
                                                                   ---
                                                                   261

Habershon says that in the (his) second and third divisions of the
cases the causes were as follows:

  From Bright's disease .63
  From pyaemia, 13; erysipelas, 5; puerperal fever, 10; with
    pneumonia, 3.31

I have drawn thus liberally from Habershon's paper because it is the
only paper that I know, in any language, founded on the analysis of a
large number of cases (for five hundred post-mortem examinations is a
large number for a disease no more frequent than peritonitis), in the
belief that he dealt with facts and that his conclusions must be of
great value.He may differ with other physicians regarding what
constitutes strumous disease and in the agency of heart disease.He may
have mistaken coincidence for consequence, but the paper bears the
marks of honesty and good faith from the beginning to the end.In Habershon's second division, under which he ranks the cases of
{1138} peritonitis caused by "a changed condition of the blood," he
ascribes 63 to albuminuria.Every physician knows how often meningitis
or pericarditis or pleurisy may occur under these circumstances,
especially in young persons; but, for myself, I cannot but express
surprise at these figures.In one capacity or another I have been
connected with large hospitals for forty-eight years, and have seen
many cases of albuminuria in private practice, and can recall but few
instances in which kidney disease, excepting cancer and other tumors,
has terminated in peritonitis.In modification of this statement,
however, it is proper to add that the hospital physician cannot know
how half the diseases he treats terminate, on account of the American
plan of interrupted service, and even less can he know of the mode of
death in cases which he sees in consultation.Even with this admission,
from my standpoint it is not easy to believe that one-eighth of the
cases of peritonitis are caused by albuminuria.The word pyaemia used by Habershon, it seems to me, ought to be
replaced by septicaemia, and it has been by many of the profession.Sedillot many years ago proved that laudable pus injected into the
blood-vessels of the dog produced no signs of disease, but that septic
pus, so used, was followed by grave symptoms, even death.Among the
author's cases thirteen were associated with the septic poison.He also
found five which he thinks were independent of erysipelas.One in one
hundred is a proportion hardly large enough to establish the relation
of cause and effect against the chances of concurrence.I can make a remark with reference to the inquiry by C. Dubacy in the
October number (1881) of the _American Journal of Medical Sciences_,
whether diphtheria produces peritonitis.When diphtheria became
epidemic among us in 1860 or 1861 for several years, I saw a great deal
of it, but did not recognize any relation between it and peritonitis.The relations of hernia, injuries, and operations to peritonitis need
no commentary.Perforations of the alimentary canal may require some illustrative
statements.These occur most frequently in the vermiform appendix of
the caecum, and are almost invariably caused by some irritating
substance imprisoned in its tube.In some cases it is a seed of some
fruit, as the orange or lemon; in others, a cherry-pit; in one that I
remember it was a small stone, such as is sometimes found in rice; in
others, a hard fecal concretion; in one, a child, a singular formation:
a strawberry-seed was the centre; around this a layer of fecal matter,
around the fecal matter a calcareous layer, on this, again, a fecal
layer, and so on to the number of six layers, the external one being
calcareous.This body was about one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and
may have been years in forming.In this connection I may state, per
contra, that I am informed that in a pathological museum in Boston is
preserved an appendix that contains, and did contain, a large number of
bird-shot, which did no mischief except to enlarge the appendix.This
was from the body of a man who had shot and eaten many birds.My
observation has led me to the belief that a large proportion of the
cases of peritonitis occurring in children are due to perforation of
the appendix.Of the diseases of the liver producing acute diffuse peritonitis, the
foremost, I think, is abscess, single or multiple.The different modes
in which gall-stones may produce it may be illustrated by the following
{1139} cases: (1) A lady died of acute peritonitis.At post-mortem
examination a large abscess was found, bounded above by the liver, in
other directions by adherent intestines; it contained nearly a quart of
pus: at the bottom of the sac was a single gall-stone, very large and
very black; the gall-bladder was perforated and very much shrunken.The
gall-stone had caused an ulceration of the gall-bladder, but none of
the intestines, in this respect differing from the process known as
painless transit of a gall-stone.So the calculus caused the abscess,
and the abscess caused the general peritonitis.(2) A lady between
fifty and sixty years of age had an attack of gall-stone pains; she had
had them before.In a few hours symptoms of peritonitis were manifest,
and she died.The post-mortem examination showed the ductus cysticus
was ulcerated and perforated.Two gall-stones of large size had been
formed in the gall-bladder, and had been pushed forward into the duct
about halfway to the common duct, leaving it enlarged as they advanced.The foremost one had caused an ulcer on the anterior or lower side of
the duct, and bile had escaped, staining all the right half of the
abdominal cavity, and throughout this half only the parts were covered
with false membrane and stained with bile.John Freeland of Antigua had a
patient, a <DW52> woman sixty-five years of age, who had been
suffering from intermittent fever, gastric disorder, and retching.In
one of the vomiting spells she experienced great pain, which, being
relieved by an opiate, soon returned and was attended by tympanitic and
tender abdomen.The
cavity of the abdomen was found filled with blood and bile, the
intestines inflamed and gangrenous in spots, and there was general
peritonitis.The gall-bladder was empty; the hepatic duct was
lacerated, and contained pouches in which gall-stones were encysted.This laceration was surrounded by
evidences of recent inflammation, and caused the general
peritonitis.[2]

[Footnote 2: The _Medical Record_, Dec.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have been attended by
little inflammation of the peritoneum.Death has followed this accident
in twenty to thirty-six hours.There has been little pain, little
tumefaction of the bowels, little tenderness, but a sense of sinking
and a peculiar feeling at the stomach which the patient finds it
difficult to describe.The ulcers of dysentery do at times perforate all the coats of the
colon, and yet do not with any uniformity cause general peritonitis;
but as the destructive process approaches the outer covering the latter
becomes inflamed, and lymph enough is effused to close the opening and
prevent the escape of the contents of the intestine; so that, while
perforation is not uncommon, I have rarely seen diffuse peritonitis
accompanying dysentery.Habershon reports 5 cases in which incomplete typhoid ulcers of the
intestines caused peritonitis, and 15 from the complete perforation.I
believe that the physicians of this country and those of France have
found the complete perforation much the most common.I do not remember to have seen fecal accumulation in the intestines
produce peritonitis at all general.I did see, years ago, a man of
middle {1140} age in whom fecal impaction in the ascending colon had
caused destruction of all the layers of the abdominal wall on the right
side, so that the contents of the intestine were exposed to view in a
space of three inches by two.This implies that there had been
peritoneal inflammation enough to seal the intestine to the abdominal
wall on all the borders of this extraordinary ulcer.The man recovered
in about six months, and returned to his business.The inconsiderable operation of tapping for abdominal and ovarian
dropsy has sometimes been followed by acute peritonitis.In the early
part of my professional life I met with several such cases, and have
witnessed the same from time to time since.These were mostly cases of
dropsy from cirrhosis of the liver.Habershon found 5 such cases, and 7
in the tapping of ovarian cysts.The rupture of ovarian cysts has produced peritonitis, but in a larger
number of cases such rupture, even when the result of violence, has not
led to inflammation; but the kidney secretion has been greatly
augmented and the fluid absorbed, so that the rupture has been
beneficial rather than harmful.Tumors, particularly those of a malignant character, are apt to grow to
the surrounding structures by adhesions the result of chronic
inflammation, but now and then they provoke an acute attack which
becomes general.Benign tumors may, in rare instances, do this.In one
case a man died of acute peritonitis, and the examination showed that a
tumor noticed before death, a very large serous cyst standing out of
the left kidney, downward-forward, was the only lesion that antedated
the inflammation.Infiltration of urine, in any of the several ways in which it can reach
the peritoneum, is a cause of peritonitis.Pelvic cellulitis may also
be a cause, though twenty or thirty cases in succession may run a
favorable course with no secondary lesions; it is still recognized as
one of the occasional causes of peritonitis.Among the rare causes of diffusive peritonitis is perforation of the
intestine by lumbricoid worms.In such cases the product of the
inflammatory action is apt to be sero-purulent, with but a limited
amount of fibrin.E. Marcus reports such a perforation, and it was
called by Peris ascaridophagie.The worms were apparently not found in
the peritoneal cavity, but in the intestines.The perforation had
bloodless edges, which lay quite close upon one another, as if they had
been separated by a piercing action of the attenuated extremity of the
parasite not eaten through.[3]

[Footnote 3: _N.Y.Lusk finds that certain vaginal injections excite a local peritonitis.Sentey gives the details of a case in which a midwife undertook to
procure an abortion by the douche.She used a tube that was large with
a spreading mouth or opening, which probably received the neck of the
uterus in such a way as to prevent the return of the water.It was, in
consequence, forced into the uterus and through one of the Fallopian
tubes into the peritoneal cavity.By this a rapidly-fatal peritonitis
was developed.It would seem that
this mode of procuring abortion can be frightfully misused, however
safe it may be in skilful hands.There is a word still to be said regarding the difference between
peritonitis produced by wounds, operations, violence, and internal
growths, or {1141} what, with a little liberty, may be called traumatic
causes, and that which arises spontaneously or without recognizable
cause.The first shows a tendency to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of the injury, and more frequently does not become
general; while the latter spreads pretty quickly over the whole extent
of the peritoneum.SYMPTOMS.--There is, perhaps, no grave disease whose symptomatology is
more easily interpreted, in which the diagnosis is more easily made,
than the average case of acute diffuse peritonitis.Yet there are
obscure cases which it is difficult to recognize.In a well-marked case the first symptom is pain.Chomel and even some
later writers believe that chill precedes the pain, but to the best of
my recollection it has not generally so occurred to me; and the
question arises, Have they kept the symptoms of puerperal peritonitis
separated from those of simple peritonitis?The pain is first felt in a somewhat limited space in the abdomen, and
pretty rapidly spreads, so that it is soon felt in every part of the
bowels.It may remain greatest in the part where it first began, but
there are many exceptions to this statement.As the disease advances
the pain and tenderness become more marked, and the patient will try to
diminish the tension of the abdominal walls by lying on his back and by
bending the hip- and knee-joints, often also for the additional purpose
of lifting the bedclothes from his abdomen.Often the patient will
resist the physician's movement to examine his bowel with the hand.In
the last few hours of life the pain ceases.The pulse in its frequency follows the advances in the disease.At the
onset it is not much accelerated, but in two or three hours it may
reach 100 to 120 in the minute.Besides becoming more frequent, it
becomes smaller in volume and more tense.Toward the end of a fatal
case it may reach 140 to 160 in the minute and be very small.In the early hours of peritonitis the bowels begin to swell, and
percussion shows that the swelling is caused by gaseous accumulation.This increases as the disease goes on, so that in some the bowels
become greatly distended--so much, indeed, as to diminish the thoracic
space and interfere with the respiration.As the disease advances the
tympanitic resonance may give place to dulness on percussion on the
sides and lower part of the abdomen.Before the introduction of opium in the treatment of peritonitis the
green vomit was a marked feature of the disease.It occurs in other
conditions, but rarely, and its occurrence in this disease was so
common that it was regarded as almost diagnostic.The fluid vomited is
of a spinach-green color, and the color is probably derived from the
bile; at least, I have examined it repeatedly for the blood-elements,
and have not found them.In these days this symptom of peritonitis is
not often observed.Constipation is absolute in uncomplicated peritonitis of ordinary
severity, and I believe is caused by a temporary paralysis of the
muscular layer of the intestine.It has already been stated that the
blood-supply of the peritoneum is through vessels whose capillaries are
shared by that membrane and the tissues which it covers.Inflammatory
action in the peritoneum of average severity would naturally extend to
this muscular layer and render it inactive.When the inflammation
abates it recovers its contractile power.Thus, the intestines become
entirely insensitive to {1142} cathartic medicines.This fact is not
observed in puerperal peritonitis, probably because the large share
which the uterus takes of the disease may act, in some degree, as a
derivative; and then, so far as I know, the muscular layer of the
intestines does not undergo the change of color and appearance in the
latter disease that has been observed in the former.This obstinate
constipation has been noticed from the first discovery of the disease,
and during forty years in the first part of this century many
physicians believed that if they could overcome it their patients would
recover.The present interpretation of this conviction is that if
catharsis, which was very rarely effected, did precede recovery, the
disease was not of a grave type--if, indeed, it was peritonitis at all.Sometimes peritonitis occurs in the course of a diarrhoea; then the
constipation is not at once established, but the symptoms of the two
diseases concur for one or two days, when the diarrhoea ceases.Abdominal respiration ceases when peritonitis is established, either
because the movements of the diaphragm produce pain or because the
diaphragm is partly paralyzed, as is the muscle of the intestines.Then
the gaseous distension of the bowels obstructs the action of this
muscle.As a clinical fact it is important, and has often helped me in
a diagnosis.Another kindred fact is that all the indications of
peristaltic action cease.I have a great many times placed my hand on
the abdomen and patiently waited for a sensation that would be evidence
of intestinal movements, but did not discover any--have placed my ear
on the surface of the abdomen, and have long listened for the gurgling
which is so constant in healthy bowels, and have listened in vain.In
this respect my observations differ from those of Battey, who reports
that he has heard the friction of the newly-made false membrane in
respiration, while I concur with him in the statement that the
sensation of friction can be felt by pressure of the ends of the
fingers into the abdominal wall so as to produce indentation.It should
be said regarding the friction sound in respiration that Battey has the
support of Chomel, and he in his turn quotes Barth and Roger; so that
there may be in this sign more than I have thus far found.The temperature of the body is not, considering the extent of membrane
involved, remarkably high.I have recently attended a most
carefully-observed case in which the temperature never rose above 104
degrees F. It falls below the temperature of health as the disease
approaches a fatal termination.From the time this disease was recognized as a separate and distinct
affection the countenance has fixed the attention of writers.The face
is pale and bloodless and the features pinched, and the general
expression is one of anxiety and suffering.I do not remember to have
seen a flushed face in peritonitis, although the degree of paleness
differs in different patients.The mind is almost always clear, unless disturbed by the medicines used
in the treatment.Yet cases are recorded in which a mild, and still
more rarely a violent, delirium has been noticed.Subsultus tendinum,
and even convulsions, have been witnessed, but whether these symptoms
belong to the peritonitis or to an accompanying uraemia has not
received the attention of those who have witnessed them.The urine is usually scanty and high-, but it does not often
{1143} contain either albumen or casts.This statement is presumably
untrue of the cases in which Bright's disease preceded the peritonitis
and is supposed to be the cause of it--a variety of the disease with
which I have already declared my scanty acquaintance.The urine is
often voided with difficulty, and sometimes retained, so that resort to
a catheter becomes necessary.The symptoms of this disease are not invariable.In one case the
inflation of the bowels is only enough to be perceptible; in another,
as I have said, it becomes a distressing symptom, while in most the
bowels are obstinately constipated.A case may now and then occur in
which evacuations can be procured by cathartics.Pain is regarded by
all physicians as the most constant symptom, and it has existed in
every case that I have seen, or at least tenderness; but the late
Griscom stated to me that a man once came to his office for advice in
whom he suspected peritonitis; but the man asserted that he had no
pain, and the doctor placed his fist on the abdominal wall and pushed
backward till he was resisted by the spinal column, the man asserting
that the pressure did not hurt him; yet he died the next day, the
doctor declared, of peritonitis.This may be credible in view of the
fact that absence of pain in puerperal peritonitis is not very
uncommon.The green vomit, which was expected in all cases forty years
ago, for the most part, as I have intimated, disappears under the opium
treatment.There are persons in whom peritonitis does not accelerate
the pulse beyond 100 beats in the minute.The pain, in rare cases,
remits and recurs with some degree of regularity, in this respect
resembling intestinal colic.Andral reports such a case; I have also
witnessed it.MORTALITY.--Up to the time when the opium treatment was adopted,
peritonitis was a fearful word; a large proportion of those attacked by
it died of it.In 1832, I began to visit hospitals as a medical
student, and for eight years, at home or abroad, was almost a daily
attendant.The number of recoveries of those that I saw in that time
can be counted on the fingers of one hand.This may be regarded as its
natural mortality, for the treatment of that day seemed to exercise
little or no control over it.(Farther on this matter will be referred
to again.)DURATION.--Chomel believed that the disease might prove fatal in
eighteen hours, while he regards its average duration as seven or eight
days.I very much doubt whether peritonitis, not caused by perforation,
violence, or surgical operation, was ever fatal in eighteen hours.I do
not remember any case of shorter duration than two or three days.Then,
on the other hand, the period of seven or eight days in the fatal cases
appears to me too long.In the early part of my professional life I
remember to have looked for death in three or four days.At present, in
the fatal cases, life is prolonged to double or more than double that
time.In the majority of those that recover at present the duration of
the symptoms is from two days to a week; in a few they have continued
fourteen days; and lately I have assisted in the treatment of a case in
which there was little amelioration for forty days, and yet the
peritonitis was cured.DIAGNOSIS.--When the symptoms are fully developed there are few
diseases that are more easily recognized.It is when these symptoms are
slowly or irregularly manifested, or when some other disease which may
account for many of the symptoms occurs with it or precedes it, that
there {1144} should be any real difficulty.It is customary to regard
the danger of confounding the transit of a renal or hepatic calculus
with peritonitis as worthy of comment.But if the reader will turn to
the articles in this work which relate to these topics, he will find
the symptoms so widely different from those enumerated in this article
as belonging to peritonitis that he will be surprised that this item in
the diagnosis should have occupied so much room.In a case already referred to, in which peritonitis followed gall-stone
pains, the transition was so marked by the rapid acceleration of the
pulse and swelling of the abdomen that each of the three physicians in
attendance at once appreciated the significance of the change.A
physician who resided in the country called on me to report his own
case.He had a little before had a very painful affection of the
abdomen which continued for three days.The pain was paroxysmal,
confined to the region of the liver, back and front, for one day; after
that there was some tenderness over most of the abdomen, but no
tympanitis.His pulse became frequent and his temperature advanced to
103 degrees.His physicians believed that these symptoms justified them
in treating him for peritonitis.Yet his position in bed was constantly
changed, and no one attitude long continued--a restlessness which never
occurs in peritonitis, but is common in calculus transits.Add to this
the absence of gaseous distension and of the green vomit, the
paroxysmal character of the pain (though I remember one case in which
peritoneal pain increased and diminished somewhat regularly, but only
one), and, finally, the sudden cessation of the pain, such as often
happens in calculus transit when the calculus passes into the
intestine,--it is plain that his sufferings were caused by a
gall-stone.The elevation of temperature was the result of a
long-continued worry of the nervous system, and the abdominal
tenderness came from the many times repeated contraction of the
abdominal muscles which occurs in hepatic colic.And then, to make the
diagnosis more complete, this gentleman, after twelve or fourteen hours
of pain, became jaundiced--in the end very much so.There was no
absolute constipation, and the stools were of the color of clay from
the absence of bile.The points of difference between renal colic and peritonitis are even
better defined and easier recognized than those between it and hepatic
colic.In intestinal colic there may be some inflation of the bowels, and if
it continues a day or two there may be some tenderness; but it is for
the most part distinguished from peritonitis by the intermittent or
remittent character of the pain, by its greater severity while it
lasts, by its courting, rather than repulsing, pressure, by the
moderate acceleration of the pulse, by no or only slight elevation of
temperature (exception being made for long continuance), by the absence
of the green vomit, by the absence of the fixed position of
peritonitis, etc.There does not seem to me any need of spending time to distinguish
gastritis or enteritis or neuralgia from peritonitis, their symptoms
are so wholly different; and if, as is said, the mucous inflammation
can penetrate all the coats of the stomach or intestine, and so cause
inflammation of the peritoneal layer, that is peritonitis, and will be
distinguished by the proper symptoms of peritonitis.TREATMENT.--Chomel[4] says: "If general peritonitis is intense, it
{1145} should be attacked by the most powerful therapeutic agents.One
should immediately prescribe a large bleeding from the arm--from 500 to
600 grammes, for example--and repeat according to the need once or even
twice in the first twenty-four hours; apply to the abdomen, and
particularly to the part of it where the pain was first felt, leeches
in large number--fifty, even a hundred--as the violence of the disease
may demand and the strength of the patient will permit."He recommends
baths, presumably tepid, and describes an apparatus by which the
patient can be put into the bath and lifted out of it without pain;
prescribes a fixed posture, gentle laxatives, mercurial frictions,
blisters; conditionally and doubtfully, paracentesis, emetics under
certain circumstances--musk, etc.In the treatment of
general peritonitis there is no reference to opium.The word does not
occur, but it does in the treatment of peritonitis following
perforation.In this condition he would, among other things, give opium
a haute dose, but he does not prescribe any repetition or give any
details.It is probable that the idea was obtained from Graves, whose
first use of opium in this accident was in 1821, although its first
publication appears to have been by Stokes in 1832.[Footnote 4: _Dictionnaire de Medecine_, 1841.]Wardell,[5] who has written the latest treatise on the disease we are
considering, relies greatly on bloodletting, but falls short of Chomel
in the quantity of blood he would take--would bleed, not to withdraw a
certain number of ounces, but to produce certain effects.The
venesection is to be followed by the application of leeches--twenty,
thirty, or forty--to the abdomen; after this turpentine applications to
the bowels.After depletion, he says, opium should be given at once:
"two or three grains may be given in urgent cases."Vesication he calls
"another of our aids."He disapproves of cathartics, but when there is
accumulation in the colon would use injections."Opium in the asthenic
form is the chief agent, and Graves and Stokes were among the first
physicians who gave it very largely.""Two or three grains may at first
be prescribed, and a grain every four or three, or even two, hours
afterward.""In perforation there is sometimes great toleration of the
drug.Murchison has known so large a quantity as sixty grains to be
given in three days with impunity."Mercurials, he thinks, are of
doubtful efficacy.In the paragraph devoted to the treatment of
puerperal peritonitis the word opium does not occur, and it is only by
a very doubtful inference that we can assume that he would ever use it.Chomel makes no allusion to the use of opium in the same disease.[Footnote 5: _Reynolds's System of Medicine_.]For two years (1834-36) I was connected with the New York Hospital as
house-physician or in positions by which that office is reached.The
treatment of acute diffuse peritonitis then and there was formulated as
follows: First, a full bleeding from the arm, commonly sixteen ounces,
then a dozen or more leeches to the abdomen; following this, another
bleeding or not, in the discretion of the physician.Meantime, the
patient would take half a grain to a grain of calomel every two hours,
with a little opium "to prevent the calomel acting on the bowels," of
which there was no danger, in truth.Mercurial inunction was used at
the same time.The belief was that after depletion the most important
thing was "to establish mercurial action in the system;" in other
words, {1146} "to diminish the plasticity of the blood."Under this
plan I saw one recovery in these two years.In 1840, I went to Vermont to give a course of lectures in the Vermont
Medical College, and while there was called by the physicians to see
with them several cases of peritonitis.I found that they were treating
the disease on the Armstrong plan; that is, bleeding freely, and then
administering a full dose of opium, as they said, "to prolong the
effects of the bleeding."In most cases there was a second bleeding and
a second administration of opium.Leeches were also used, and
irritating applications to the abdomen, and in some cases purges.I
found they were getting better results than we were in New York, and I
studied their cases as closely as I could, and reached the conclusion
that opium was the curative agent, and that it would be safe to omit
the abstraction of blood.This conviction grew in strength with every
new case, and I saw, with different physicians, several cases, the
disease being more prevalent among the mountains there than in the
city--at least that year.The idea then formed was that to establish
the narcotic effects of opium within safe limits, and continue them by
repeated administration of the drug, would cure uncomplicated
peritonitis--that a kind of saturation of the system with opium would
be inconsistent with the progress of the inflammation, and would subdue
it.There was no theory to build the treatment on, and no explanation
of the action of the drug in my mind.What I saw of the action of two
full doses of opium was the only foundation for the idea.I had in the
course of two years after those observations in Vermont 9 cases of
general acute peritonitis, 8 of which were cured.All these were
reported in succession, as they occurred, to the medical societies and
in my college lectures.The plan was adopted by many members of these
societies and by others with whom I had opportunity of conversing on
the subject, so that soon there were several--I may say many--workers
in the field; and in all instances where the practitioner had the
courage to carry out the treatment favorable reports were returned.Not
that every case of peritonitis was cured, but the recoveries generally
exceeded those that followed any other plan ever before used.No
physician tried it with a proper understanding of its details, and with
courage to execute them, who if living does not practise it to-day.The treatment of puerperal peritonitis is not allotted to me, and I am
very reluctent to encroach in any degree on the province of the very
competent and highly-esteemed gentleman to whom that disease was
assigned.But the history of the opium treatment is very incomplete
without the statement I am about to make, and I trust to his generosity
to forgive this encroachment; and all the more confidently because he
was not at the time acquainted with the manner in which opium was first
introduced into the treatment of puerperal fever.After the curative action of the drug was demonstrated in general
peritonitis, I was anxious to try it in puerperal fever, of which
peritonitis forms a part.But I had no hospital and no obstetrical
practice.In 1847, I was appointed one of the physicians to Bellevue
Hospital, to which an obstetrical department was attached.After one or
two years a single case occurred and was sent to my division.I gave
her 100 grains of opium in four days, with more or less of calomel--I
have {1147} forgotten how much.She recovered, but after the symptoms
of puerperal fever passed away she had secondary abscesses of the
lungs.In 1840 there was a very fatal visitation of puerperal fever in this
hospital, and on invitation of Vache, who then had charge of the whole
institution, I was a daily visitor and took notes of all the cases.It
was from these notes that Vache compiled his report of the epidemic
published in the _Medical and Surgical Journal_.The disease was
fearfully fatal, although every known mode of treatment was tried in
different cases, including Brenan's plan by turpentine, but all, with
one or two exceptions, with the same result.At this time the opium
plan was on its trial, and I had not acquired a confidence in it that
authorized me to try it in these cases.One woman was sent to me in
whom the disease was well advanced.I instructed my house-physician not
how much opium to give, but what effects to produce by it.I found this
woman dying the next day, and that she had taken only three grains of
opium in three doses.In three or four days seven cases were sent me
from the lying-in wards.One was returned for error in diagnosis, and
six put under treatment.Having found that prudence in my
house-physician was so much more conspicuous than courage, another
house-officer, who combined them both, was selected to be in almost
constant attendance.The instruction I gave him was in these words: "I
want you to narcotize those women to within an inch of their lives."He
did it, and saved every one of them.This gentleman is now known over
the whole land as a learned and distinguished surgeon.I feel called
upon to give his name in this connection, that he may be a witness to
the facts I state, and for the admiration with which his nerve and
prudence impressed me.One of these patients took first two grains,
then three grains, then four, and so on till she took twelve grains of
opium at a dose, the intervals being two hours.The state into which
the patient was to be brought I have denominated a state of
semi-narcotism.The quantity of the drug necessary to produce this
state varied surprisingly in different persons.One of these women was
pretty fully narcotized by four grains every two hours.She was watched
with anxiety; restoratives were kept in readiness, but nothing was done
but to suspend the administration of the medicine and to wait.In seven
hours the consciousness was fully restored, and the improvement in her
condition was wonderful.But in a few
hours more the symptoms recurred, and the same medicine was again given
in three-grain doses, and again narcotism was produced.Taught by the
experience of the day before, we waited, and when she recovered from
this second narcotism her disease was completely cured.She took no
more medicine of any sort.This case was very instructive, as it taught
me that over certain cases of puerperal fever opium has absolute
control.From the time here referred to, so long as the obstetrical service was
maintained at Bellevue Hospital, a large proportion of cases of this
fever, as they occurred, were sent to my wards, and in all these years
I have not lost faith in opium.This statement, however, requires an
explanation.Puerperal fever is a compound disease.Its great
inflammatory lesions are found in the uterus and its appendages and in
the peritoneum.{1148} When the inflammation of the uterus is the
dominant lesion, and is purulent, opium has little or perhaps no
control over its fatality; but in the cases in which peritonitis is the
ruling lesion, if begun early, it will show its power.In this
connection I will only add that in private practice the drug has been
perhaps more curative than in the hospital.I have seen many cases in
consultation, and a decided majority have recovered.In some instances
the patient has fallen into a pleasant sleep, only broken by some
administration, and ending with her recovery.In one instance a very
eminent physician had undertaken to treat a case by the opium plan, but
he had administered the drug so timidly that for fourteen days he had
done no more than hold the disease in check.After trial, I found that
I could not induce him to give the drug in my way, and I asked him to
give me sole charge of the patient for twenty-four hours.To this he
assented, remarking, "If you cure her, doctor, I will have it announced
to the profession that she was the sickest person I ever saw get well."In half the time allowed me I was able to establish the opium symptoms
as given farther on, and the lady slowly recovered.The treatment of any form of peritonitis by opium permits the use of
the drug itself, or of any extract or preparation of it which contains
its narcotic qualities, but it is wise to persevere with that one first
chosen unless there is strong reason for a change.This caution is
based on the fact that we cannot change from one to another and be
certain to obtain the same drug activity.For example, we begin with
laudanum, and find what it will do.We cannot take in its place the
sulphate of morphia with the certainty that we can so graduate it as to
get precisely the same effects.Then the quantity which will be
effectual in one case may be quite inadequate for the next.The
tolerance of opium in different persons varies remarkably, and probably
the disease itself increases the tolerance in all.This will be
illustrated by some of the details of this paper.The drug symptoms to be produced are as follows: Subsidence or marked
diminution of the pain; some or considerable tendency to sleep;
contraction of the pupils; reduction of the breathing to twelve
respirations in the minute; in the favorable cases a considerable
reduction in the frequency of the pulse; a gentle perspiration; an
itchy state of skin, or oftener of the nose; absolute inactivity of the
bowels, and after a time a subsidence of the tumor and tenderness in
them; some suffusion of the eyes.Of these several signs of opiumism there is none more easily observed
and none more valuable than the frequency of the respiration; and while
the physician aims to reduce it to twelve in a minute, there are
chances that he will see it fall to something below that.I have often
counted it at seven, and in perhaps two cases it fell to seven in two
minutes; and yet these cases of marked oppression from opium all
recovered.In the cases in which the respiration has fallen so low
there has been considerable obtuseness of the mind; but in no case
except in the hospital patient already referred to have I seen
unconsciousness.Then the sleepiness, so long as the patient is easily
awakened, is wholly within the limits of safety.As to the quantity of opium to be given, I have known two grains every
two hours do the work, and in other cases many times this {1149}
quantity was necessary to produce this condition of semi-narcotism.The
plan is to begin with a dose that is safe--say two or three grains of
opium or its equivalent of sulphate of morphia--and in two hours notice
its effects.If any of the opium symptoms have appeared, repeat the
dose; if none, increase by one grain, and so on at intervals of two
hours till the degree of tolerance in the patient is ascertained.After
that the case can be treated by a diminished occupation of the
physician's time--two or three visits a day.The dose is to be
increased if the opium symptoms diminish before the disease yields, but
always to be diminished or discontinued if narcotism is approaching.The duration of the treatment will be sometimes no more than two or
three days; it may be a week, or even a fortnight, and in one case
already mentioned the symptoms persisted mildly for forty days, and
then yielded.In this case the medicine used was the sulphate of
morphia, and the enormous dose reached by steady and graduated increase
was one grain and a quarter every forty minutes in a boy ten years old.In some puerperal cases the doses have been so large as to require
witnesses to make the statement of them credible, and the
administration of them criminal had not the effect of each dose been
carefully studied and the amount of each measured by the action or
inadequate action of the next preceding one.Here are the doses given a woman who fell sick October 13, 1857; the
record was made by C. H. Rawson during the treatment, and was kindly
given me two or three years ago: On the first appearance of her
disease, while the diagnosis was uncertain, 10 grains of Dover's powder
gave her a quiet night.The next day the disease was more manifest, and
she took of Magendie's solution (2 grains of sulphate of morphine to a
drachm of water) x minims every hour; growing worse, at night she took
xxx minims every hour; the next day, xl minims every hour, and no
change of symptoms.She took in twenty-four hours 32 grains of sulphate
of morphia; slept, but was awakened by the slightest noise.On the
fourth day 3-1/3 drachms of the solution, and opium as follows: at 4
P.M., 3 gr.; at 5 P.M., 4 gr.; at 6 P.M., 5 gr.; at 7 P.M., 6 gr., and
6 gr.Fifth day, in twenty-six hours
took in opium and morphine the equivalent of 208 gr.of opium; on the seventh day, 221 gr.of opium; on
the eighth, 224 gr.; on the ninth, the same quantity; on the tenth, the
same; on the eleventh, 247 gr., pulse subsiding; on the twelfth, 261
gr., other symptoms better; on the thirteenth, 144 gr.hourly; slept for the first time heavily, all other symptoms
improving, bowels moved freely, ate well, tympanites subsiding;
fifteenth day, 1 gr.of opium every two hours, and at night the last
dose.The woman denied the opium habit, and the
medicines were tested by the apothecary.Such doses can only find their
justification in the demonstrated fact that smaller doses will not
produce the degree of narcotism desired.In Keating's edition of Ramsbotham's _Midwifery_ a case is reported by
myself in which a woman, by pretty rapidly increasing doses, reached
forty-eight grain doses of opium, with the effect of curing her disease
and substituting a temporary active delirium.A word of caution is probably necessary regarding the use of opium in
high doses when peritonitis and Bright's disease coexist.I have {1150}
already said that I have but scanty personal knowledge of such a
concurrence, but in Bright's disease alone I have known a large,
non-heroic dose of an opiate fatal.For example: A young man had a
felon on his finger, and did not sleep, so great was his pain.His
physician prescribed 40 drops of laudanum at bedtime.Not sleeping on
this, he took another portion of 40 drops, and in the morning he was
found in a comatose condition, and in the course of the day he died.A
post-mortem examination revealed Bright's disease, which was not before
suspected.A woman took half a grain of the sulphate of morphine--for
what reason I do not know.I was called to see her when she was in a
semi-comatose state.The time between my seeing her and that of taking
the morphine was fourteen or fifteen hours; its removal from the body
was therefore hopeless.Her limbs were swollen with oedema, and the
urine contained albumen and casts.Although the usual means of opposing
the poisonous effects of opium were resorted to, they were of little
use, and the patient died in the course of the day.These are selected
from a considerable number of similar cases that show a similarity in
their action on the brain of opium and urea.It seems that opium
precipitates the uraemic coma, yet the coma produced by these agents
combined is not so profound as that produced by opium alone.There is
in it some movement of the limbs or body or some imperfect utterances,
yet it seems to be more fatal than the coma of opium unaided.Notwithstanding all this, I have met with several cases of cardiac
disease combined with Bright's--perhaps I should say many--in which
half a grain of morphia sulphate has been taken every night to procure
sleep with only beneficial results.This has been observed several
times when physicians have been the patients.These facts are stated to show the hesitation and prudence that should
control the administration of opium when there is urea in the blood,
whether there is peritonitis or not; but a case in which one form of
Bright's disease preceded, and perhaps caused, peritonitis will be more
instructive: A gentleman sixty-eight years of age was attacked by
peritonitis on Thursday evening.There was a moderate chill at the
onset (this being one of the few cases in which I have witnessed this
occurrence).The diagnosis was then uncertain, and he took quieting
doses of Dover's powder, which gave him sleep.The next day the
diagnosis was easily made.The urine was examined for albumen, and none
found.He took only six-eighths of a grain of
sulphate of morphine in the first twenty hours.It was then increased,
so that in the next twenty-four hours he took two grains of the
sulphate in divided doses--a quantity which has been greatly exceeded
in hundreds of cases with the best results; but in this case coma was
the result.on Sunday he was comatose, but not profoundly;
he could be aroused.The breaths were five in the minute, the pulse
increasing in frequency; secretion of urine next to none.After seven hours, while the respiration was growing
more natural, the pulse grew more frequent and the stupor increased.the breathing was fifteen in the minute, and full and
perfectly easy, but the pulse was running at 140, and the coma
unbroken, and the pupils of good size.The effects of the opiate had
passed off, but those of uraemia were profound.After the alarming symptoms occurred we tried to procure another
specimen of the urine for fuller examination, but {1151} could not.It
was only after his death that we procured the evidences that he had
shown symptoms of contracted kidney for months.The urine contained no
albumen at the time of our examination, as very often happens in that
disease.Regarding other points in the opium treatment there is little to be
said.The bowels should be left
entirely at rest till they recover their muscular tone; then they will
expel first the gas, and then the feces; or if, after the inflammation
is subdued, they do not move of their own accord, injections are
admissible.I have often left the bowels absolutely inactive for
fourteen days without any recognizable consequences.If I meet a
physician who believes that leeches are essential, I yield him his
point, but never advise them.I do this because a moderate bloodletting
will do no harm, and little if any good.The same rule I apply to
irritating applications to the surface of the abdomen.Mercurials, I
think, are harmful, and therefore I object to them.As to food, it
should be milk, fresh eggs beaten up with water and pleasantly
flavored, peptones, etc.selected from among those that leave no
refuse.The testimony of physicians who have adopted this plan within my own
circle is unanimously in favor of it.B. R. Palmer of Woodstock, Vt.,
afterward of Louisville, Ky., who was the first to test it, told me
after a few years' trial that he used to dread peritonitis as he would
dread the plague, but with opium in his pocket he met it cheerfully and
hopefully, as he did a pneumonia.Chalmers of New York, who is known by
many readers of this article, has a very extensive practice, and he
told me lately that he had not had a fatal case of peritonitis in
twenty-two years.From whom did the profession
adopt it?In 1836-37, I visited daily the hospitals of London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, was in frequent intercourse with the physicians
of those cities, and never saw a patient anywhere treated by opium, and
never heard the least allusion to it.I can safely appeal to any
physician who was familiar with the history of the profession before
the year 1840, or for two or three years later perhaps, to inquire
whether anything was generally known regarding this treatment of
peritonitis, or whether he himself ever heard of it.Let the inquiry be
made of Willard Parker of New York or Alfred Stille of
Philadelphia--men of a degree of intelligence and learning that has
made them leaders in the profession--and of all the profession at that
time.I venture to assume that they were as ignorant as I was of what
Graves and Stokes had done.The following fact is significant: In 1843, Graves published _A System
of Clinical Medicine_, the preface of which is dated January, 1843.In
this he says he had previously published essays, lectures, and articles
in several medical journals.In this volume he intends, he says, "to
revise what I have written, and to compress the whole within the limits
of a single volume."There is nothing in the table of contents or
explanatory headings of the several chapters of this volume which
alludes to treating peritonitis by opium.It is fair to infer that the
cases treated in 1823 had made little impression on his mind, and that
he did not think his treatment could take rank as a discovery; and yet
Stokes had made favorable mention of it eleven years before this
publication.Graves, then, did not {1152} publish his cases, and the
first knowledge which the profession could have of them was through
Stokes's paper, published in the _Dublin Journal of Medical and
Chemical Science_, No.Perhaps the reason why Stokes's
paper produced so little impression on the profession may be found in
the fact that first numbers of journals of every sort have few readers.Anyway, it was not till after the opium treatment had attracted much
attention in this country that anybody here knew that Graves or Stokes
had ever had anything to do with it.Besides, Graves and Stokes had
only used opium in cases of perforation, and they had no plan or
symptomatic guide in the use of the drug.There is something new and strange in the following case copied from
the _Medical Record_ of May 12, 1883, under the heading, "Operative
Measures in Acute Peritonitis:" "Dr.Reibel relates the case of a
child, eight years old, suffering from acute idiopathic peritonitis.The disease had resisted all treatment, and the child being,
apparently, about to die, it was determined to open the abdomen with a
view to removing the fluid and washing out the peritoneal cavity with a
solution of carbolic acid.No fluid was
found in the abdominal cavity.In prolonging the incision a loop of the
intestine was punctured, as evidenced by the escape of gas and
intestinal fluid.The wound was washed with carbolic acid and covered
with a layer of antiseptic cotton.The following day the little patient
was nearly free from pain, and was able to retain a little milk.The
temperature had fallen from 104 degrees to 101 degrees, and the
tympanitis was almost entirely gone.The (wounded) loop of intestine
was adherent to the abdominal wall, and there had been no escape of
fluid into the peritoneal cavity.The patient made an excellent
recovery."If the statements of this abstract are true, and the future supports
the practice pursued in this case, acute peritonitis is likely to
become a surgical rather than a medical disease.Reibel thinks that
opening the intestine in the way he did is a better plan than the
punctures with the exploring-needle to relieve the patient of the
tympanitis.But it will require more facts than one to persuade the
profession that this mishap of the scalpel can grow into a rule of
practice.(The _Record_ finds this report in the _Journal de Medecine
de Paris_.)I cannot say that I see the value of a distinction made in 1877 by
Gubler between peritonitis and peritonism.By the latter term is meant
the total of nervous and other symptoms that arise in the course of
peritonitis.Trasour has lately revived this distinction, and thinks it
important, and that a light peritonitis may be attended by a grave
peritonism.He holds that the distinction is important, because "the
treatment of peritonism consists in the administration of alcohol,
chloral, and especially of opium in large doses.Of the latter fifteen
grains may be given in twenty-four hours.""The symptoms [of
peritonism] are produced through the agency of the great
sympathetic."[6]

[Footnote 6: _Med.I cannot say that I have seen great effects follow small causes, but
think that, in general, the effects of peritonitis on the pulse,
strength, nervous tone, etc.are, to some extent at least, a measure of
its severity.CONSEQUENCES OF PERITONITIS.--These are usually nothing.When recovery
takes place it is commonly complete, but cases have been known {1153}
in which the intestines have been left bound to the abdominal wall and
to each other, and so made incapable of their natural action.The
results of this are a swollen, tympanitic abdomen and impaction of the
bowels, but the general health may be very good.A woman at Bellevue
was left in this condition, yet she performed the duties of nurse in
one of the wards for some years, and finally disappeared from the
institution, and I do not know how it ended with her--probably by the
breaking up of the adhesions and a return of the bowels to their
natural condition.In some few cases there remains new tissue, which in time is partly
broken up and remains partly attached.In this manner strings and bands
of considerable strength can be formed, and into these loops the
intestine may pass, so as to form an internal hernia of a very
dangerous character.In some bands are formed across the intestine,
which by contraction flatten the tube and obstruct the fecal movement.There is reason to believe that such bands and bridles are formed by
local inflammation of such imperfect manifestation by symptoms that the
patient knows nothing about it.A very striking case illustrating the
possible sequence of this inflammation came under my observation early
in my professional life: A <DW52> woman about twenty-five years of age
gave a very clear history of a peritonitis from the consequences of
which she had suffered two years before I saw her.About six months
after recovery she began to have constipation and to suffer from small
and frequent discharges of urine.The latter gradually grew milky and
to have a bad odor; the constipation grew more and more, and at length
came to be absolute for many days; then would come a diarrhoea of some
hours' continuance, after which she would have a feeling of relief.She was emaciated, and so feeble as
hardly able to leave her bed.She vomited occasionally, and her
appetite for food was all gone.The urine was heavily loaded with pus,
and was ammoniacal.At post-mortem
examination a firm membrane was found strained across the upper strait
of the pelvis, wholly separating the abdominal cavity from the pelvic.The left posterior border was drawn very
tensely over the colon where it passed into the pelvic cavity,
flattening it down completely and making stricture.To the under or
lower surface the fundus of the uterus and the base of the bladder were
firmly adherent, and in this way both were suspended.The effect of
this unnatural suspension of the inactive uterus did not seem to be
noticeable, but with the bladder it was very different: it contained
three to four ounces of water, ammoniacal and full of pus, and it could
never have emptied itself.During the
peritonitis a false membrane was effused on the pelvic viscera in situ.When the period of contraction which is common to all such structures
came, the new membrane was separated from the greater part of these two
organs, but not from their bases.The firm attachment to the brim of
the pelvis did the rest.So unusual a sequel of peritonitis I think
deserves a record.I should add there were no adhesions above the
pelvis.Such a structure as this, found long after the active symptoms
of peritonitis have passed, as also the bands and cords before spoken
of, does not give support to the doctrine that the false membranes are
broken down into fatty matter, and in this condition absorbed.{1154} The possible remote effects of peritonitis are shown in a case
reported by E. A. Mearns to the _Medical Record_, published Sept.15,
1883: A young man, aged nineteen, four years after he had had acute
general peritonitis was attacked with constipation, which was absolute.He had had before occasional attacks of pain in the bowels and
constipation, which were overcome.He had the
train of symptoms usual in intestinal obstruction.There was no fever
or tympanitis, and this time but little pain.There was a tangle and a constriction of the intestines at the middle
of the ileum, caused by the contraction and hardening of the effusion
of the old peritonitis, and the intestine was very much softened.H. B. Sands reports in another number of the same journal: "The patient
was a man about thirty who had suffered from acute obstruction for a
week.When the abdomen was opened the
intestinal coils were found extremely adherent one to another in
consequence of a former peritonitis.A careful search failed to
discover the nature or seat of the obstruction.The abdominal wound was
closed, and the patient died soon after."There is no part of the gastro-intestinal canal that may not, from one
cause or another, become the seat of ulceration.The jejunum is the
part of the tube long supposed to be an exception to this rule, but
even in it one or two observers have found ulcers.These ulcers often
exist without distinctive symptoms, and may go on to cicatrization
without announcing themselves.In the stomach, however, there are
commonly indications which will admit a conjecture of their existence,
and perhaps a diagnosis.Sometimes these ulcers penetrate all the
tissues of the tube and allow the contents of the intestine to escape
into the peritoneal cavity, or they may have destroyed all but the
external layer, and some succussion, as in coughing, sneezing,
laughing, or perhaps straining at stool, may make the opening complete,
with the same results.In these cases it seems to be inevitable that
inflammation should follow, unless it has preceded, the complete
opening and sealed it up by adhesions.The tendency of such an
inflammation is to be local and limited, but when the contents of
intestines escape into the peritoneal cavity it usually becomes
general.These accidents are usually attended by the sudden development
of local pain, by rapid increase in the frequency of the pulse,
paleness, and prostration.The perforation of the vermiform appendix is
often a partial exception to this statement, for, while the local
symptoms are marked, the sympathy of the general system is not so
quickly awakened.The same can be said of perityphlitis.The symptoms
are often local for some time--a day or more; sometimes subside, as if
the disease were cured, and then return in full form.This is produced
by the tendency of the inflammation to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of its cause.Lymph is effused at a short distance from
the point of irritation, and seals the parts together, so as to shut in
the offending substance; and though this substance may produce pus in
contact with intestine or appendix, that {1155} fluid is held for a
time, as in abscess.It may be permanently held in its new-made sac
till it burrows into some near part, as the intestine or bladder, or
remain an abscess till opened by Willard Parker's puncture.On the
other hand, the contents of this sac may be increased till it breaks
bounds and causes extension of the peritoneal inflammation or general
peritonitis.In one particular case this process of setting limits and
breaking through them occurred in a young lady four times at intervals
of from one to two days.When the limiting adhesions were established
symptoms would subside, so as to encourage in her physicians the hope,
even the expectation, of recovery; but again and again the fire was
rekindled, and she died eight days after the first attack.In the
greater number of cases the first breaking of the adhesions is followed
by full peritonitis, and this often by death.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have not been
attended by the severe pain described by most authors, but by a sudden
prostration of strength and a feeling of disquiet and sinking at the
stomach; more of collapse than of inflammation in the symptoms; no
tumefaction of the bowels; almost nothing to indicate the nature of the
accident, but a sudden new sensation in the bowels, a rapid increase in
the frequency of the pulse, it growing small as it increases in
rapidity, and a pale and shrunken countenance, and death in from twelve
to thirty hours.Then, on inspection, hardly any signs of peritonitis
are found.The peritoneal vessels are fuller and the membrane redder
than in health, and its surface covered with the thinnest possible film
of lymphy exudation, and some serum in the deeper parts of the cavity.These ulcerations of the stomach are not always fatal by peritonitis.A
few instances are recorded in which adhesions of the outer surface of
the organ to adjoining organs have taken place, so as to protect the
peritoneum almost wholly from the fatal contact with the gastric
fluids, and death has occurred in some other way.I have a remarkable
specimen illustrating this fact.It was taken from the body of a woman
of about middle age who had long had symptoms of dyspepsia, and had
from time to time vomited a little blood.It was not difficult to
recognize ulcer, but the extent and peculiarities of it could be
learned only by inspection.She died suddenly of copious haematemesis.On examination an ulcer two and a half to three inches in its several
diameters was found, beginning near the pylorus and extending toward
the left, which in this large space had destroyed all the coats of the
stomach and exposed an inch and more of the right extremity of the
pancreas and about the same extent of the liver.The liver and pancreas
were both perceptibly eroded when exposed, and in the latter an artery
that would admit the head of a large pin was opened.The stomach,
outside of this extraordinary ulcer, was strongly attached to the
adjacent organs.The ulcerations of typhoid fever penetrate the intestine about three
times in a hundred cases of the fever.This result is reached by the
study of a large number of cases, and appears to be pretty generally
admitted.The point where this perforation occurs is in the ileum, near
the ileo-caecal valve--within a foot or eighteen inches of it in the
great majority of cases, although it has been known to occur
seventy-two inches above the valve, and it has been seen very rarely in
the caecum.The fever itself may be either severe or mild.Suddenly
severe pain {1156} sets in, oftenest in the lower part of the abdomen,
and spreads rapidly; the pulse is quickly accelerated and becomes
small; and it has been lately stated that in this and other intestinal
perforations the gases of the bowels, escaping into the peritoneal
cavity, will give resonance to percussion over the lower part of the
liver.Fetid gas found in this cavity after death is not without
importance; for example, a distinguished Senator at Washington died not
long ago of a very painful abdominal disease which his physicians
declined to relieve with opium, though the patient pleaded for it.Although the distance he had to
travel was many hundred miles, he found the patient alive and still
suffering.He at once gave morphine for the relief of the pain, but the
patient died.Now, this gentleman had diabetes a year or more before
his death, recognized by his physician at home and also by myself.While under my observation the urine ceased to contain sugar and its
quantity became normal, but soon after this albumen was occasionally
found in it.The quantity was generally small, and casts were only
found now and then.This new disease was mild, and seemed to be, within
certain limits, manageable.He went to Washington under injunction that
he was not to let official and professional labors bear with any weight
upon him.This last sickness and the death would naturally enough be
supposed to be some new phase or consequence of the previous illness.But, while a post-mortem examination was not permitted, the family
wished to have the body embalmed.The family physician accompanied the
embalmer, and as the latter made a cut through the abdominal walls
there was a gush of air laden with fecal odor, and he through this
opening saw the intestines covered with false membrane.He satisfied
himself that the intestine was not opened.This fetid gas came from the
peritoneal cavity.An ulcer had perforated the intestine somewhere, and
caused the death.The final disease could be only remotely dependent on
the patient's previous illness, if at all.His impaired health may have
made the ulcer possible.All kinds of perforations in the bowels, except those of the stomach,
caecum, and appendix, even the cancerous, have one history and the same
symptoms; and if treatment is ever successful in such occurrences it
must all be based on one set of rules--absolute rest, no pressure on
the bowels, and no movements of the muscles that will aggravate it;
food that will be wholly digested and absorbed by the stomach; complete
abstinence from cathartic and laxative medicines, and the free
administration of opium or morphine.By these means, I fully believe,
numbers have already been saved from the fatal consequences of
peritonitis caused by perityphlitis and perforation of the vermiform
appendix--some under my own observation and others under that of my
friends.A boy fourteen years of age was brought to bed by a pain in
the right iliac fossa.After a few hours his father, a physician,
desired me to see him.There was already a perceptible fulness, with
dulness on percussion, in the fossa, and some febrile excitement.I
gave a portion of morphine, and promised to call the next morning.In
the morning a message came from the father stating that the boy was
better and there was no need of further attendance.The pain had returned, and had spread over most of the
bowels.He took tincture of opium, of which
I believe the largest dose was 100 {1157} drops, reached after three or
four days of gradual but steady increase of dose.From that point the
patient got better, and the quantity of the medicine was
correspondingly reduced.There were a relapse and a repetition of the
treatment, and again the disease yielded.During convalescence, about
fourteen days from the attack, the boy, after emptying his bladder, was
suddenly pressed to continue the discharge.Now he voided what appeared
to be blood, two or three tablespoonfuls.It was, however, pus with
blood enough to color it.This purulent discharge from the bladder
continued for about three weeks, the boy steadily recovering his
health.This occurred twenty or more years ago, and that boy is now a
well-known physician.In 1850, or thereabout, I attended a physician through an attack of
typhoid fever.In the third week there was a sudden outbreak of
peritonitis.The opium treatment was resorted to, and he recovered, and
had good health for twenty years after.Peritonitis occurs rarely in
typhoid fever from any other cause than perforation, and its occurrence
in this case at this time, when perforation is more likely to occur,
renders it probable, at least, that this attack was produced by that
cause.March 3, 1883, autopsy of Wm.Fletcher, age 59, iron-worker.23d, he was attacked with pain in the region of the right
iliac fossa; it was severe.There was no chill, but little fever, and
only slight acceleration of the pulse.His stomach was a good deal
disturbed, and the bowels were soon distended with flatus.I saw him on
the Tuesday following, with James D. Elliott.The bowels were a good
deal swollen and very resonant on percussion; pulse 84.His stomach was
still greatly disturbed, so that he retained no food, yet there was no
green vomit, but much flatulency.The movements in respiration were
particularly noticeable, being nearly or quite as much abdominal as in
health.There was a short friction sound in inspiration, but an entire
absence of the sound produced by peristaltic action.There was no
dulness on percussing over the iliac fossa, and no pain on pressure
over any part of the abdomen.I was careful in examining the right
fossa, for the first pain was there, and it was severe; but there was
no physical sign by which the perforation could be ascertained.Still,
my mind dwelt on the probability of perforation, and I expressed my
fears to Elliott regarding it.The bowels had not moved for two or three days.The next day Flint was added to the consultation.The symptoms had
changed but little; the pulse was 102; no pain, no tenderness, no
peristaltic action; slight friction at one point only; the abdominal
respiration was as marked as before.Frequency of respiration, 18;
patient sleepy; pupils only slightly contracted.When we were in
consultation I again expressed my fear of perforation, but Flint
expressed the most decided opinion as to its absence, because there was
dulness to percussion over the liver.I had read his paper on the
intrusion of gas between the ribs and liver in cases of intestinal
perforation, and felt as if I were almost reproved for entertaining the
thought without this physical corroboration.Thursday, March 1st, the stomach had become much more retentive; there
were no pain and no tenderness on pressure; pulse 109; no friction
sound, no sound of peristaltic action, no dulness on percussion over
right iliac fossa, but resonance over the whole abdomen, excepting over
the {1158} pubes; there the resonance was not clear; over a small space
there was dulness; this was ascribed to moderate fulness of the
bladder, and, as there had been no difficulty in emptying it, nothing
was said of it.The abdominal respiratory movements were the same as
before.Friday morning, at 3 A.M., no marked change had occurred in the
symptoms, but from this time onward there was a steady sinking of the
vital powers.The pulse grew small and frequent, the hands became cool,
the breathing more frequent, and without any sudden change or new
symptom he died early in the morning.At the last visit there was no
resonance on percussion over the liver.Autopsy, Saturday, March 3d, 2 P.M.The bowels were distended, as they
mostly are in peritonitis, but not extraordinarily.There was now
pretty free resonance over the liver.The section to open the abdominal
cavity was carefully made, with the aim of ascertaining whether there
was air or gas in the peritoneal cavity.When a half-inch opening was
made through the peritoneum, gas was forced out through it for some
seconds with an unmistakable noise.The bowels were not opened by this
cut.The bowels exposed, a very thin film of false membrane was found
on all the middle and upper portions of the intestines, with a fringe
of injection where the folds came in contact.But two or three inches
above the symphysis pubis the section opened a collection of pus which
extended downward into the pelvis.Somewhere hereabout--neither of us
could say exactly where--was found a lump of fecal matter, not
indurated, as large as a marrowfat pea, the intestine still unopened.Search was made for the vermiform appendix.At first it was not
recognized on account of its remarkable shortness.It was found,
however, pointing directly toward the median line of the body, and was
short because a part had been separated from the rest by slough.The
end of what remained was marked by a border, one-eighth of an inch
deep, of a very dark-green gangrenous color.We did not attempt to
measure the quantity of pus.It was
completely bounded and shut in by adhesions.At no time during life was there resonance over the liver, but there
was some at the time of post-mortem examination before the bowels were
opened, due perhaps to the fact that at death the relaxation of the
muscles allowed the gas to rise higher than it did during life.The
unusual median position of the abscess is important in accounting for
absence of dulness, when it is usually found in slough or ulcer of the
vermiform appendix."A Fatal Case of Typhlitis without Recognizable Symptoms."Under this
title Jose M. Fisser published a case of inflammation of the vermiform
appendix causing general peritonitis in a young woman nineteen years of
age.The peculiarities of the case were that the appendix was not
perforated, and consequently there was no tumor in the right iliac
fossa--that the symptoms were all referred to the epigastrium, without
even tenderness in the fossa.She walked the floor and tossed about in
bed; the highest temperature was 103 degrees, and the most frequent
pulse was 120, and these continued but a short time.Of tympanitis
there was none till near death, and then but little.The obscurity in
diagnosis led to the publication of the case.The cause of this disease
was fecal matter, not very hard, in the appendix.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Med.{1159} As much has been said in this article on the diagnosis of
peritonitis, it may be well to introduce a case where that diagnosis
was conjectural, and yet quite another state existed.H----, when her disease was advanced, twice.My impression was that she
had peritonitis, but this opinion was held with grave doubt.After her
death, Smith sent me the following record of the autopsy: "Mrs.H----
died Friday evening at ten o'clock; next day, at three in the
afternoon, we made an autopsy.No gas or fluid in the peritoneal
cavity; the small intestines inflated almost to bursting, with
injection of the capillaries.In the left iliac region we at once
discovered a portion of the intestine almost black, and on examination
found a firm white band encircling and constricting that portion.Upon
liberating the gas the intestines collapsed, and the constricted
portion was released and easily removed.A further examination showed
that two of the epiploic appendages, coming off from the colon above
the sigmoid flexure, had united at their extreme points and formed a
loop two and a half to three inches long, and through this loop or ring
a portion of the ileum had passed, and was there constricted.The
constricted intestine was about four feet in length.This examination
has been gratifying to me.There was a small quantity of bloody serum
in the peritoneal cavity low down in the pelvis.The dark grumous blood
that passed the bowels on the second and third days can now be
accounted for, and corroborates your remark that the hemorrhage looked
like strangulation.This must be a new
cause of strangulation, and one that we could not anticipate."There was, before I saw her, a single vomit of a suspicious fluid, but
the evidence was not strong enough to enable us to pronounce it
stercoraceous.Some of the observers noticed bloody serum in the
peritoneal cavity, and perhaps some shreds of lymph, but that was in
consequence of the strangulation.This may occur anywhere in the broad extent of the peritoneum, and will
be more or less limited in different cases, or may be limited for a
time, and then become general.The
product of the diseased action may be serum or lymph or pus, or all of
them.The cause of this local inflammation is sometimes very obvious,
in other cases wholly unknown.The consequences vary all the way from
harmlessness to death; the symptoms are as variable as the
consequences, making the diagnosis easy in some cases, in others
impossible.Some cases in which it was not difficult to recognize it
have already been recorded--those caused by perityphlitis and
perforation of the vermiform appendix, for example.In such cases the
local pain, the swelling, the dulness or resonance on percussion,
depending on whether the tumor is made by inflammatory exudation or
gas, together with the general symptoms and the history, leave but
little ground for doubt regarding the character of the disease.Perhaps
one-half the local abscesses which form between the folds of the
peritoneum are recognizable during life by the local, associated with
the general, symptoms.When situated in the posterior and upper part of
the abdominal cavity, the hand gives little, {1160} perhaps no,
assistance, as in the most widely-known case of abscess that has been
recorded in all time.While the physicians were giving to the country
hopeful reports day by day, thousands of medical men shook their heads
and spoke sadly of the prospects.The illustrious patient was losing
rather than gaining strength and flesh, his appetite poor, his
digestion poor--a strong man growing helpless--and, above all, a pulse
that for months never fell below 100.With an adequate cause of
abscess, whether there were chills or not, what else could it be?Thus,
in peritoneal abscesses that cannot be felt the general symptoms are of
great importance to the diagnosis.When abscesses tend to discharge
their contents soon or late--sometimes into the intestine, sometimes
into the bladder, sometimes externally: in such cases there is a fair
chance.Sometimes they burst into the peritoneum: such cases are almost
inevitably fatal; even opium will not cure them.The pus of these
abscesses often has the fecal odor, which it acquires by the
transmission of the intestinal gases through the intestinal walls.I
was attending, with the late James R. Wood, a young lady in whom
peritoneal abscess had been recognized.It was anterior to the
intestines.In the consultation, while we were discussing the propriety
of using the trocar, the mother became alarmed at the odor and
appearance of the urine just passed, and summoned the doctors back to
the chamber.The urine
contained pus which gave off the fecal odor strongly.It should be added that these abscesses, as well as those of
the convex surface of the liver and those that are post-peritoneal,
sometimes pierce the diaphragm and produce empyema, or by previous
adhesion of the lung to its upper surface find a way into a bronchial
tube, and so the pus is expectorated.The history of local fibrinous exudations is not as easily told as that
of the purulent.We find from time to time, on the peritoneum, bands,
patches, or cords of false membrane, which were produced in so quiet a
way that we can get no information regarding the time when they were
formed, and perhaps the subject of them was not aware that anything was
wrong with the bowels till he began to have the symptoms of
obstruction.The omentum is found thickened and contracted.The mesentery and
mesocolon are seen in a similar condition, causing wrinkling and
shortening of the bowels.The spleen has on its surface patches or even
plates, or one great plate, of firm fibrinous deposit, often
cartilaginous in density, sometimes calcareous; and we can rarely fix
the time of these occurrences by any symptoms.It is not always so with
the liver.We are acquainted with a perihepatitis which is acute,
attended by pain in the right side, a febrile movement, and, if the
inflammation reaches the under surface of the organ, by jaundice, and
have learned to combat this with cups and opiates, the latter in rather
free but not heroic doses, and to expect recovery in a few days.This
may leave the liver wholly or partly invested with a layer of false
membrane which may have a sequel of importance.Then, again, we find
the organ invested with a thick contractile membrane, but cannot learn
that the symptoms of perihepatitis have ever occurred.The diseased
action which produced this bad investment appears to be analogous to
that which not only covers the organ with a thinner coat of similar new
tissue, but inlays it everywhere with the same material in cirrhosis.This also is {1161} unattended by local pain.The effects that may
result from this encasing of the liver in a strong contractile capsule
may be illustrated by the following case (the late Buck was the
physician): The patient was an unmarried lady of middle age who had
consecrated her life to charitable works.In searching for the
suffering poor she often had to ascend several flights of stairs.The
time came when she found this fatiguing and a tax on her respiration.She observed at the same time that the bowels were enlarged.She called
Buck, and he had no difficulty in discovering ascitic fluid.He was
surprised, as he knew that her habits were perfectly good, and she had
very little the appearance of an invalid.Notwithstanding the proper
use of the usual remedies for dropsy, the fluid slowly increased, and
at length he was obliged to draw it off.He found it to be a clear,
yellowish serum.In the course of about two years she was tapped four
times.I saw her, with Buck, after these tappings, when the fluid had
again been effused in quantity that half filled the peritoneal cavity.The emaciation was not considerable; there was nothing of the
semi-bronzed color of the skin so common in cirrhosis of similar
duration; her appetite and digestion were not materially impaired; the
temperature was natural; the pulse was increased in frequency only a
few beats.The skin over the abdomen was in a soft, natural state, and
there was nothing that suggested a hyperaemic or inflammatory dropsy.The liver on percussion appeared to be reduced in size.Taking all
things into account, and especially the patient's habits and the
absence cancerous cachexia, it seemed probable that the dropsy arose
from atrophy of the liver, and that the atrophy was caused by an
adventitious capsule of the organ, although the patient had never had
symptoms of perihepatitis.From this point the fluid did not increase
or diminish, but remained stationary till she died, perhaps two years
after, of some other disease.Meanwhile, the lady resumed her favorite
charity-work to a limited extent.At the post-mortem examination the
capsule was found investing nearly the whole liver, but not materially
obstructing the gall-duct.The new membrane was thick and strong,
having a thickness of at least one-twentieth of an inch.The remaining
liver structure was of natural appearance.The organ was reduced to
one-half its natural size.I have doubted whether any disease deserving this name really exists
independent of such low inflammatory action as may arise from the
irritations of tumors or heterologous deposits.This statement refers
to general not local peritonitis.I have never seen anything that would
lead me to believe that acute diffuse peritonitis can be deprived of
its acute character and still continue an inflammation.With me it has
always been death or cure.I have already referred to a case in which
after recovery the bowels were greatly disturbed by tympanitis for
years.But this came from adhesions: her general health was good.I
have at long intervals met with cases of ascites in which the
peritoneal membrane was redder than natural, and in which no
obstruction to the portal {1162} circulation was discovered.This,
however, I have regarded as hyperaemia rather than inflammation.Bauer,[8] however, gives to these cases the title latent general
peritonitis, especially when after death an abnormal adhesion is found
here and there.In the cases that I have seen there was a peculiar
state of the surface of the abdomen.The skin there was more or less
scaly and dry, but I do not remember whether there were internal
adhesions.Bauer regards the diagnosis of this form of disease as
difficult, but refers to the constantly present meteorism as well as
serous fluid.I have met with three or four instances in which at the
time of puberty an abdominal dropsy has rather suddenly occurred,
lasting one to three months, and disappearing on the use of diuretics.I have had no reason to attribute this effusion to inflammatory action,
except in one case.A lady of extraordinary symmetry and beauty of
form, in excellent health, whom I had treated for this disorder twelve
years before, applied to know whether there was anything in that
disease that would prevent her having children.She had been married
seven or eight years, and had not been pregnant.The question then
occurred to me, At the time of the dropsy could there have been lymphy
exudation that has since confined the ovaries in an unnatural position?The treatment which Bauer prefers for
his latent peritonitis consists in "painting with iodine, the use of
diuretics, and the regulation of diaphoresis by means of Turkish
baths."[Footnote 8: _Cyclopaedia of the Practice, etc._, vol.Another form of general chronic peritonitis is, according to Bauer,
that which follows acute peritonitis.He quotes several authorities in
support of his views.I must draw on him for a description of it, for,
as I have said, practically I know nothing about it.The symptoms of acute peritonitis are all toned down, but do not all
disappear.Vomiting occurs occasionally; tenderness is diminished, but
is quite perceptible; meteorism diminishes, but fluctuates greatly;
appetite is poor or variable; constipation alternates with diarrhoea or
is followed by dysentery; now there is a febrile heat, and then the
temperature is normal--this fever is most likely to come in the
evening; the pulse is frequent and varying; ultimately extreme
emaciation and anaemia.The most striking feature of this condition
appears to be sacculation of the fluid in the abdomen, wholly or
partially; this fluid then is not freely movable, but will give dulness
on percussion, which may contrast well with intestinal resonance in its
immediate neighborhood.When the tension of the abdominal wall is
diminished these sacs can be felt by the hand as uneven tumors.Colicky
pains occur, and in a case cited it was at one time very severe, at
another only slight.The majority of the cases terminate, after a
protracted course, fatally.Recovery may occur by absorption or
external evacuation of the fluid.Bauer makes still another class of cases of chronic peritonitis--those
arising in the course of old ascites; he, however, does not make much
out of it.He thinks the cases of this kind occur with cardiac and
hepatic disease, and particularly with the nutmeg liver.The symptoms,
he admits, are neither well defined nor severe, and the anatomical
changes consist "in thickening of the serous membrane by a slight
deposit of fibrin, {1163} slight turbidity of the ascitic fluid, and a
few flakes of fibrin suspended in it."He then, strangely, gives, as if
they were illustrations of such a disease, two cases in which death by
acute peritonitis followed the last of many tappings, in one of which a
pool of pus was found encysted in front of the intestines.Probably most practitioners who are in the habit of making post-mortem
examinations have seen the flakes of lymph in the ascitic fluid, etc.,
but the German physicians have been the first, I believe, to regard
such cases as belonging to separate forms of disease.William Pepper has published[9] a case observed by himself and G. A.
Rex which shows non-malignant chronic peritonitis better than any I can
recall to mind.The report forms the sequel to the case of the young
woman on whom he successfully performed paracentesis of the
pericardium.This young woman began to have double pleuritic effusion, and this was
soon followed by ascites three and a half months after the operation.From that time the ascites was better or worse, but did not wholly
leave her, and became considerable before her death.This was sudden,
she having some convulsive movements in extremis.Lesions were found in
the thoracic cavity like those discovered in the abdominal, showing, it
was believed, a special tendency in this person to plastic exudation on
the serous membranes."The lower part of the abdomen was found occupied
by an extensive effusion.There
were few if any signs of inflammation of the intestinal peritoneum, but
marked changes were observed in the parietal peritoneum and in the
capsules of the liver and spleen.The peritonitis was most marked in
the upper segment of the abdomen, while the parietal membrane presented
large patches of irregular thickening.No tubercles were found on any
part of the peritoneum.The capsules of the liver and spleen were
greatly thickened, whitish, opaque, and densely fibrous.The liver was
enlarged and heavy, and so tightly bound by its thickened capsule that
its shape was somewhat altered."The diaphragm, especially that part of it underlying the pericardial
sacs, had undergone marked fibroid degeneration.The muscular tissue
was much atrophied; many fasciculi had evidently disappeared, while
many others were markedly narrowed, some of them shading off to a width
of less than 1/3000 of an inch, and finally disappearing altogether.They retained, however, even in their narrowest dimensions, their
transverse striae."(It may be remarked, in passing, that this substitution of fibrous for
muscular tissue follows the same law that it does in the heart when
that organ is the seat of fibrosis or fibrous degeneration.Here it was
supposed to be the consequence of a low grade of inflammatory action.In the abdomen these observers found nothing which suggested the
possibility of tubercles or any obscure form of cancer.In the
pericardium, on the heart side, were found numerous small nodular
roughnesses.Irregularities of the pericardial false membrane are so
common that nothing but the close and universal adhesions would raise
any question of these relations.But tubercles would hardly be here and
nowhere else.{1164} Delafield says that one form of the chronic disease is the
continuance of his cellular peritonitis.In this, he says, the surface
of the omentum is covered with cells which look as if they were derived
from the endothelium and connective-tissue cells, although they differ
from the normal shape of these.The new cells are for the most part
polygonal, of different size, with one or several nuclei, and
giant-cells--large granular masses filled with nuclei.Although these
new cells are produced over the entire surface of the peritoneum, yet,
as a rule, they are more numerous in little patches here and there.These little patches may be heaped together in such numbers as to form
nodules visible to the naked eye.There is never any stroma between
these cells.This form of peritonitis occurs most frequently with organic heart
disease, with cirrhosis of the liver, with chronic pulmonary phthisis,
and with acute general tuberculosis.In the two latter diseases he
thinks they have been improperly called tubercles.He describes a form of chronic adhesion of peritoneal surfaces that
occurs without the intervention of fibrin, but, as he supposes, by
coalescence of the branching cells and a production from them of a
fibrillated basement substance, the fibrils crossing in all directions.In the midst of these fibrils he finds the nuclei of these cells.He
finds also in the immediate neighborhood of these adhesions thousands
of branching cells that are attached one to another and float free in
the water, the fixed end being attached to the peritoneum.He regards
such a peritonitis with adhesions as a more advanced stage of the forms
of cellular peritonitis already described, and the new cells are
changed into membrane.Sayre has published an extraordinary case in the _Transactions of the
Pathological Society_.He calls it chronic proliferative peritonitis;
it might be called more aptly the consequence of peritonitis.A large, strong man fell from a hammock, the rope breaking, upon his
shoulders, and felt a severe pain in his stomach, and soon developed
symptoms of peritonitis.About one month after he was tapped, and
240 ounces of serum were drawn.He was tapped one hundred and
eighty-seven times, and 1203-5/16 pounds of fluid were taken from him
during the remainder of his life.The liver and spleen were covered by a
thick layer of false membrane, intestines were glued together in the
upper part of the abdomen, and the stomach was adherent to the lower
surface of the liver.The portal vein was contracted by this membranous
coating.There were numerous other lesions in the heart and pleura, but
these will account for the dropsy.This man was unusually strong and hearty until 1876, when he had an
attack of double pleuro-pneumonia, and in 1878 he slipped on the front
steps and fell, but seemed to recover from the effects of this.The
fall from the swing occurred in July, 1879.[10]

[Footnote 10: _Med.{1165} Tubercular Peritonitis.This form of disease is by no means uniform in its first symptoms or in
its progress.The only things uniformly attending it are tubercles on
the peritoneum and more or less of inflammatory effusion, chiefly lymph
and serum; tumor and hardness of the bowels, general or local; deranged
function of the stomach and intestines; emaciation; and extreme
fatality.In some cases the invasion is acute and marked--a chill followed by
fever, vomiting, early development of meteorism, and in a few days a
point or points of resistance to pressure, but not necessarily dulness
on percussion.In a few days the febrile action and the meteorism may
subside, leaving the symptoms of local peritonitis.But we have not
long to wait for a renewal of them and an evident extension of the
inflammatory action.Remission and relapse alternate at varying
intervals, until the whole extent of the peritoneal surface seems to be
involved in inflammation.With this mode of development meteorism may
not be renewed in the most common way.The lymphy product of
inflammation may so bind the intestines to the posterior walls of the
abdomen that they cannot extend forward, but are pushed upward against
the liver and diaphragm, and so encroach on the thoracic space.But
then the anterior parietes are tense and hard, and do not move in
respiration.The febrile heat may not continue more than two or three
months, but the pulse will be frequent to the end.There will be a
thinning of bowel walls, and here and there a knuckle of adherent
intestines may cause some prominence and give some resonance on
percussion.There will be also occasional vomiting, and the dejections
will be irregular--maybe only deficient or thin; there may be an
alternation of constipation and diarrhoea.Tuberculous ulcerations of the mucous layer of the bowels is not
uncommon in tubercular peritonitis, and these ulcers have in rare cases
perforated and allowed the fecal matter to accumulate in considerable
quantity in a sac limited by previous adhesions.In all forms of
tubercular peritonitis death is caused as often by grave complications
as by what appears to be the primary disease.The affection occurs in
probably every instance in those who had at the beginning, or had
acquired in its progress, what we call the tubercular diathesis.We are
not surprised, therefore, to find on inspection a wide diffusion of
tubercles in the body, particularly on other serous membranes, and in
the lungs.Death may occur, then, from phthisis pulmonalis or from
pleurisy or meningitis, as well as from the exhaustion and accidents of
the peritoneal disease.The effusion serum or turbid serum is very
common in tubercular peritonitis, and can be recognized by the dulness
it produces in part of the cavity, and sometimes by fluctuation.It is
often sacculated, but it is not constantly found after death, it having
been absorbed before, and perhaps long before, that event.In other cases the invasion of the disease is stealthy and deceiving.It comes so quietly that the patient is not conscious of any local
disorder beyond a dyspepsia and irregular action of the bowels.He has
a pulse of growing frequency, but if he knows it he ascribes it to his
dyspepsia.He is slowly losing flesh and strength; this he accounts for
in the same way.At length a perceptible swelling of the bowels
attracts his attention.At this stage the physician finds that the
swollen bowels are tympanitic everywhere or only in the upper, while
there is evidence of fluid {1166} effusion in the more depending,
parts.He discovers some, it may be little, tenderness on pressure, and
a pulse of 85, or maybe 90, increasing in frequency toward evening.The
appetite is poor, the digestion slow, and occasionally there is
vomiting; the complexion is pale and a little dingy; the skin of the
abdomen may be dry and rough or may be natural; some colicky pains have
been or soon will be felt.From this point the disease gradually
advances.The distension of the bowels slowly increases or they are
firmly retracted; the emaciation increases; the strength diminishes;
there is often cough, which is generally dry; the bowels are slow or
diarrhoea alternates with constipation; with the distended bowels there
is always more than natural resonance on percussion, except when there
is fluid effusion, though not often the full tympanitic sound observed
in acute diffuse peritonitis.This resonance is not equal, always, in
different parts of the abdomen; the respiration is embarrassed and
almost wholly thoracic.The abdomen is often as large as that of a
female at full term of pregnancy, and indeed the condition has been
mistaken for pregnancy.This is an inexcusable blunder in a case like
that which I have in mind--a young unmarried woman.She had no dulness
on percussion in the space that would be occupied by the gravid uterus,
but rather resonance.The case might have been a little less clear if
there had been fluid effusion in the abdominal cavity, but if this were
not encysted it would flow from one side of the abdomen to the other
when the patient turned correspondingly in bed; if it was encysted,
there would be small chances that it would have the shape and position
of the gravid uterus; if it had, there would be no chance of hearing in
it the foetal heart or feeling the foetal movements; and after all this
there remains the experimentum crucis--a vaginal examination.Some aid is found,
possibly, in the medical history of the family, in tuberculous
antecedents, yet I remember cases in which no phthisis could be found
in any living or dead member of the family on the paternal or maternal
side as far back as it could be traced.Some aid is found if the
patient himself has any of the physical or rational indications of
pulmonary phthisis, and yet there are recorded cases in which the
abdominal symptoms were the first to appear.The prominent German
physicians attach great importance to the pre-existence of a cheesy
mass or degeneration somewhere in the body as the real parent of
tubercles wherever they appear.The truth of this doctrine, I do not
think, has received anything like universal recognition; and if it had,
as this cheesy degeneration is often, perhaps commonly, only
discoverable after death, it could rarely give any assistance in
diagnosis, so that the early diagnosis is always difficult, and a very
early one often impossible.But as time goes on, and the symptoms are
better defined and show themselves one after another as they are above
described, it seems as if a careful observer could not confound it with
anything except perhaps one of the other forms of chronic peritonitis
or cancerous peritonitis.As to the latter, the cough which exists in
most cases of tubercular peritonitis will assist in the distinction,
but a physical examination much more; for a cough does not always
attend phthisis when this disease exists; for example, I visited a
daughter of one of the distinguished gentlemen of Vermont.She had had
the bowel symptoms that indicated tubercular peritonitis for eight or
ten months, and the diagnosis was not {1167} difficult.Remembering
Louis's opinion that if tubercles invade any other part of the body,
they are likely to be found at the same time in the lungs and in a more
advanced condition, I examined the lungs, and found in the upper part
of the right a cavity so large that it could have received a fist.I
was only surprised by the fact that she did not cough, and had not
coughed.She herself assured me of that (she was twenty-one years old);
her physician, who was present at the visit, had never heard her cough,
and had no suspicion of any pulmonary complication; but, more than all,
her mother, who had walked with her, slept with her, eaten with her,
travelled with her, and from the beginning of the illness had not been
out of her company more than twenty minutes in any twenty-four hours
since the disease began, had never heard her cough.Here, then, the
nervous deviation to the abdomen, or whatever else it may have been,
had so benumbed the sensibility of the pulmonary nerves that the
alarm-bell of phthisis had never been sounded; but the cavity, had
there been any doubt whether the bowel disease was cancerous or
tuberculous, would have almost fully settled the question.But more of
the peculiarities of cancerous peritonitis a little farther on.The lesions of this disease (or its pathological anatomy) differ
considerably, but the differences are in the amount of tuberculous
deposit and the secondary results, not in the real nature of the
disease.Lebert has published among his plates of pathological anatomy
one which shows the peritoneum thickly sprinkled over with small
tuberculous grains, and represents each particular grain surrounded by
a little zone of inflammatory injection.There is yet no exudation, but
that would soon follow.A fibrinous exudation will soon come over this
primary deposit, and undergo a kind of organization, or at least get
blood-vessels, which in their turn can furnish the material for a new
crop of tubercles.These again provoke a new layer of fibrous tissue,
which also becomes studded with tubercles, and so on, till a thick
covering is formed over the intestines.But the same material is
interposed between their folds, separating one from another and
compressing them and diminishing their calibre; at the same time this
agglomerated mass is firmly adherent to the abdominal walls everywhere.The new material may have a thickness of half an inch or even more.I
remember how surprised and confused I was when I made my first
inspection of such a case.The abdominal walls were cut through, but
they could not be lifted from the intestines, but were firmly adherent
to something.They were carefully dissected off and the bowel cavity
(?)exposed; there was apparently an immense tumor filling the whole
space: no intestines, no viscera, could be seen.A section was made
through this mass from above downward, and another parallel with it and
an inch distant from it, and this part removed.It appeared like a
large, hard tumor, through which the intestine made several
perforations.The new material appeared to be fibrous, with
grayish-white tubercles sprinkled in through it everywhere, and pretty
abundantly.In another case this fibro-tubercular material may occupy
one part of the abdomen, and a large serous cyst or serous cysts
another.The tuberculo-fibrous material may be found in markedly less
quantity than is so far described, till there will be no more than in a
case from Ziemssen's clinique, quoted by Bauer: "In the peritoneal
cavity about four liters of yellowish-brown, slightly turbid fluid.Omentum {1168} thickened, stretched, adherent to the anterior wall of
the abdomen and beset with hemorrhages; the same was true of the
parietal peritoneum; between the hemorrhages whitish-yellow and
entirely white tubercles occur, varying in size from the head of a pin
to a lentil.The
intestines intensely inflated; a number of ulcers on the mucous
membrane, one approaching perforation.Covering of the liver thickened
by fibrinous deposition."The lungs and serous membranes generally will, in all probability, show
more or less of tubercular deposit, the pericardium less frequently
than the others.The result in this affection, after it is fully established, is
believed to be uniformly fatal, and at its commencement the difficulty
of diagnosis may lead one to doubt whether his apparent success is
anything better than apparent.Still, a plan which I have relied on is,
I believe, worth announcing.As soon as the disease is recognized the
patient is put upon the use of the iodide of potassium and the iodide
of iron, in full average doses, and a solution of iodine in olive oil
is applied to the whole surface of the abdomen by such gentle friction
as will produce no pain; and after a minute or two of such friction the
oil is brushed thinly over the surface and the whole covered with oiled
silk.The quantity of iodine to
an ounce of oil will vary considerably in different persons; for some,
seven to ten grains will be enough; for others, thirty will be needed.The iron is to make the application moderately irritating, and if it
produce pinhead blisters or blisters a little larger, all the better.When the application becomes painful the oil is washed off, and the
application is not renewed for two or three days.In this manner it may
be continued for two or three months.Meantime, the patient is put upon
the diet and regimen of the consumptive, the appetite encouraged; he
takes sustaining food, with plenty of milk and cream, or cod-liver oil,
as much fresh air as possible, and friction is applied to other parts
of the body with dry flannel.Benign tumors of the abdomen are not frequently the cause of general
peritonitis, and when they are, the grade of the disease is acute
rather than chronic.They very often provoke local inflammation and
become adherent to the neighboring structures.The same is true of
malignant growths in the abdominal cavity, except that the adhesions
are earlier formed and more likely to occur.Localized cancer, of
whatever variety, is not very prone to produce general peritonitis,
even though there be multiple developments of it.But when the disease
takes the disseminated form, and is sprinkled over the whole extent of
the peritoneum, then inflammation is almost certain to occur--not of
high grade, and yet deserving the name subacute rather than chronic.A
case which illustrates this statement has come under my observation
within the last year.I will recite it with sufficient detail to make
it intelligible.A lady about forty years of age had, up to the summer of 1881, enjoyed
very good health, though she was never robust.At that time she felt
her strength abating and her stomach disordered.She sought {1169}
health in various places, and took professional advice in September.It
availed her little; the bowels were gradually swelling and fluctuation
could be felt.There was not a
cachectic countenance, but the features were growing sharp.She had
suffered but little from pain till October.At that time she was at the
family country home.Then she began to suffer from a severe pain in the
left thigh; and this, it was noticed, increased as the accumulation in
the bowels increased, and at length her physician felt compelled to tap
her--not so much on account of great distension of the bowel as in the
hope of relieving the pain.He drew off nine quarts of gluey, viscid
fluid, and her pain was wholly relieved.Twelve or fifteen days after
this she was brought to her city home, and her city physician, seeing
that her case was a grave one, sought the aid of a distinguished
gynaecologist.She was then again tapped to give him a more
satisfactory examination.He found the ovaries considerably enlarged
and hard.They could not, however, be felt by pressing the fingers into
the pelvis from above--only by the vagina.I saw her on the 10th of
November.The fluid had again made considerable tumefaction of the
bowels, and she was again suffering great pain in the region of the
right kidney and in the leg of the same side, together with cramps.The
relief given by the first tapping induced us to propose its repetition.It was, however, delayed till the 14th, that the physician who had
tapped her before might be present and assist.The quantity of water
drawn was again nine quarts, and again the pains and spasms were
quieted.It was
nearly clear, reddish, of syrupy flow and consistence, and so viscid
that while a portion of it had remained on the slide of the microscope
long enough for the examination of its constituents the thin cover
became so firmly attached to the slide that it could not be removed
without breaking or long maceration.The albumen was so abundant that
the fluid was completely consolidated on boiling.Fibrinous threads
were running through it in great numbers, and here and there was a cell
of large size, round, granular, but not plumped up with granules, with
a nucleus barely less in size than the cell itself; its outer border
within, but only just within, the boundary or wall of the cell.It was
the nucleus that was granular, for there was little room for granules
between the nucleus and the cell wall.The vial containing the fluid
had been standing three or four hours for a sediment.This in a vial
four inches high occupied the lower half, and gave nothing to the
dropping-tube till the sedimentary matter was drawn into it by suction.This matter consisted of fibrillated fibrin in large quantity; a great
number of the cells just described, some grouped, but most separate or
single.There were pus-cells in moderate quantity, each having the
amoeboid movements, and a considerable number of red blood-corpuscles,
some of natural form, some crenate.Immediately after the tapping the flaccid condition of the abdominal
walls admitted an examination.A solid, hard mass was found running
across the upper part of the bowels, a nodule of which was lying on the
stomach at the point of the ensiform cartilage.A harder mass of
irregular shape was also found just above the pelvis on the right side,
extending upward and to the right.This was in extent two by three
inches.The ovary, however, could not be detected by pressure from
above {1170} downward.The diagnosis up to this time was hardly
doubtful, but these revelations made it complete, and crushed any
lingering hope of the patient's recovery.While the pain and spasm ceased after the tapping, the oedema of the
left leg, which came on some time before the last tapping, did not
diminish.The hard spot near the right iliac fossa was tender on
pressure, but otherwise hardly painful.While the fluid did not exceed
six quarts or so, she had little pain anywhere.There were no external
glandular swellings.Her appetite was poor, and she took but little
food.She vomited very little till the end was approaching.The urine
contained a few globules of pus, some pigment matter, two or three
hyaline casts, but no trace of albumen.For sixteen days following
November 14th the patient was comfortable, but the fluid was slowly
filling the bowels again.At that time the pains already referred to
began to return.On December 5th they required another tapping, and
preparations were made for it, but vomiting, rather severe, led to its
postponement to the next day.The quantity of fluid drawn was nine and
a half quarts.It was of the same syrupy consistence as that previously
drawn, and under the microscope showed exactly the same constituents
and gave the same quantity of albumen.The next day stercoraceous
vomiting commenced, with no movement of the bowels, except what was
produced by 10 grains of calomel given on the second day of this
vomiting.She after
this took no food by the mouth, but milk and beef-tea were injected
into the rectum.Still, the fecal vomiting returned, and she died on
the 15th.The post-mortem examination was made on the 17th by William H. Welch.His report is complete as to the main features of
the case, though it does not furnish an explanation of the spasms and
the oedema of the left leg, regarding which Welch was not informed.The
pain and spasm were doubtless due to backward pressure of a diseased
part on a nerve or nerves, and the oedema to a narrowing of the iliac
vein by pressure or constriction by fibro-cancerous matter on its outer
sides."The peritoneal cavity," he says, "contained somewhat over a
gallon of clear, yellow serum.Both the visceral and parietal layers of
the peritoneum were thickened, in some places more than in others; this
was especially marked on the anterior of the stomach and on the lower
part of the ileum and in the left iliac region.The omentum was greatly
thickened and retracted into a firm mass (or roll), which extended
somewhat obliquely across the body, more to the left than to the right.The mesentery was much thickened and contracted, drawing the intestines
backward.In a few places only was the peritoneal surface coated with
fibrin, and the intestines were mostly free from adhesions.The coils
of the lower part of the ileum, however, were firmly matted together by
organized connective tissue in such a way that they were twisted, often
at a sharp angle, so as greatly to constrict the calibre of the gut.The serous and muscular layers of the intestine at this point were
greatly thickened.By these causes there appeared to be a complete
obstruction at a point about six inches above the ileo-caecal valve.By
careful dissection these coils were straightened out, so as to remove
the main cause of obstruction.The peritoneal covering of the liver was
adherent to the parietal layer.{1171} "The surface of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum was
studded over with hundreds of small, firm, whitish nodules, generally
not larger than a pea, and often not larger than a pin's head.In some
places they had coalesced and made firm patches an inch in extent.This
same material was found in the contracted omentum in considerable
quantity.In a few places, particularly on the uterus, a blackish
pigmented deposit appeared."The ovaries were not adherent, but both were enlarged to the size of a
hen's egg.The outer surface of each was rough and corrugated.The new
growth was deposited on the exterior and penetrated each a quarter to
half an inch.It was of uniform white color and of firm consistence."The stomach wall was thickened nearly throughout its extent, but
particularly in the anterior part, where it amounted to thrice the
normal thickness.This consisted wholly of hypertrophy of the muscular
coat and increase of fibrous tissue in the peritoneal layer.This new
growth was traced, in the interlacing bands, from the surface into the
muscular coat.In the outer layer of the stomach were found three small
white nodules.The mucous membrane of the organ was healthy or a little
pale."The retro-peritoneal glands along the aorta were enlarged, soft, and
of a reddish-gray color.A nodule was found in the wall of the duodenum
outside the mucous membrane, and one in the Fallopian tube."Every organ in the abdomen and chest was examined, but nothing
important found except what is here recorded.Welch concludes his
record with the following diagnosis: "Primary scirrhous carcinoma of
the ovaries.Secondary deposits in the peritoneum, in the outer layer
of the right Fallopian tube, of the stomach and duodenum, and in the
retro-peritoneal glands.This case presents to the reader so accurately the usual course of
cancerous peritonitis, and the inspection its lesions, that a treatise
on the subject is hardly called for.It often happens that cancerous
antecedents in the patient or his relatives will lend an aid to the
diagnosis, which this case did not present.To distinguish this disease
from tubercular peritonitis no question can arise except in its
dropsical form, and then the lungs in every case of the latter that I
have met with have the physical signs of tubercles, though not always
the rational indications.The pulse is much more accelerated in the
tuberculous variety.I omitted to state that the temperature of this
patient was often taken, and till the closing scene was never found
more than one or two degrees above the healthy standard, and the
morning and evening heat did not materially vary; the opposite of both,
then, would be expected in a tuberculous case.The existence of
meteorism is much more common in the tubercular disease; indeed, in the
cancerous case recited there was none of it.The duration of the two is
different--that of the cancerous kind is recorded in months, while the
tuberculous variety may continue two years.The cancerous is more
likely to be attended by alarming accidents, like the complete
obstruction of the bowels, large hemorrhages, and a sudden lighting up
of acute peritonitis.Finally, in the light of the case here recorded,
it seems probable that the examination of the abdominal fluid will
become of great importance.I have never carefully examined the fluid
of tubercular dropsy, but it does not seem probable that it will have
the syrupy {1172} appearance, the large amount of albumen, the
abundance of fibrin-fibres, and the granular large cells with nuclei
only perceptibly less in size than the cells themselves, that were
repeatedly found in this case--found by two observers, and at every
tapping after the first.TREATMENT cannot be curative; it therefore consists of such
administrations as will relieve pain, give sleep, improve the appetite,
increase the flow of urine if it be scanty, and relieve the bowels if
there is a tendency to constipation.It is as much the duty of the
physician to put off the fatal day, when he can, in incurable
affections as it is to cure those that will yield to his prescription
and advice.In the case just narrated opium or an opiate alone produced
such unpleasant after-effects that she was unwilling to take it, but
when the extract of belladonna was given with it she slept pleasantly,
and could take her food the next day.Infantile Peritonitis, or Peritonitis of Childhood.Bauer, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia of Practice of Medicine_, and
Wardell, in _Reynolds's System of Medicine_, have each devoted a
chapter to this form of disease.They refer to the fact that the foetus
may have peritonitis before birth or be born with it, or may have it
when a few days old.They say that this form of the disease occurs most
frequently in lying-in asylums or foundling hospitals, and that it has
been supposed to depend on a syphilitic taint.They say, too, that it
follows erysipelas, scarlet fever, measles, etc.I do not perceive that
the description of either of these authors makes any marked distinction
between this and the same disease in adults, except what may arise from
the inability of the infant to describe its sensations, and the more
rapid course of the disease to a fatal result--in some cases
twenty-four hours.Having myself had no obstetrical practice, or next
to none, I have nothing to add to their statements, and can from my own
knowledge abate nothing.I therefore refer the reader to these
chapters, and to the references given by the first of these authors,
for a fuller knowledge of the matter.Regarding the comparative exemption of children, after the first few
weeks of life, from spontaneous peritonitis, referred to by one of
these authors, I can fully confirm his statement.Though I have
assisted in the treatment of many children suffering from peritonitis,
I have difficulty in recalling to mind a single case in which the
disease was not caused by perforation of the intestine or vermiform
appendix of the caecum, and in much the greatest frequency perforation
of the appendix.B. F. Dawson,[11] after reciting a case in which the liver had
undergone a peculiar degeneration and was attended by peritonitis
before birth, states that Sir J. Y. Simpson observed nine cases in his
own practice "and notes more than a dozen from different sources."These cases seemed to have been caused by the ill-health of the mother
during gestation, or excessive labor, injuries, venereal disease, and
were mostly attended by grave disease; the viscera often, the liver;
but sometimes the mother was perfectly healthy, and the peritonitis was
the primary disease.Death almost always occurred in utero or shortly
after birth.Record_ takes the following from _Schmidt's
Jahrbucher_ for Jan.Oscar Silbermann recognizes two
varieties of peritonitis in the new-born.The non-septic or chronic is
developed usually in the first third of foetal life, and is generally
syphilitic in origin.If the peritoneum covering the intestines be
involved, as well as that over the liver and spleen, various forms of
intestinal obstruction may result.Most frequently there is occlusion
of the anus, less often stenosis or complete stricture of the small
intestine.Of a number of cases of congenital occlusion of the
intestine collected by the author, all ended fatally, only one living
beyond twelve days."The second, acute or septic, form of peritonitis in the new-born the
author divides into two varieties, according as the peritonitis is only
a part of general infection or is the sole manifestation of the septic
poison.In either case the point of entrance of the poison is always
the navel wound.The symptoms, which need not all be present in a given
case, are vomiting, watery stools, meteorism, ascites, abdominal
tenderness, icterus, etc.The pulse and temperature may vary in degree
in different cases.A cure of the septic form is possible; therefore
the treatment should be carefully considered.The navel wound should be
cleansed, and the child is to be isolated from its mother.To control
the fever quinine may be given.Priessnitz's sheet is of value;
vomiting may be checked by chloral (one-half to one grain in water).The strength should of course be maintained by stimulants if
necessary."The accumulation of fluid indicated by this name has already been
referred to in its relations to several causes.There are, however,
conditions producing it which have not been considered or only
considered partially.The most prolific source of abdominal dropsy is obstruction of the
portal circulation on its way to or through the liver.Condensation of
the liver structure in cirrhosis, with destruction of many of the
portal capillaries and compression of many more, is prominent in this
connection.The compression of the liver caused by an adventitious
external covering, referred to under the head of Local Peritonitis,
acts similarly, whether it compresses the vein at its entrance into the
liver or not, although it is not known to produce any destruction of
the portal capillaries.Some enlargements of the organ are attended by
the same result, but they are always associated with a hardening of its
structure.The disease lately called waxy liver, now often denominated
lardaceous, belongs to this class, as does that condition in which the
organ is enlarged, hardened, and fissured, regarded as syphilitic
liver.That both these diseases may have a syphilitic and mercurial
origin is not a point now under consideration.They both harden the
hepatic structure and obstruct the portal circulation, while they may
not in equal degree hinder the progress of arterial blood.This is
explained when we remember the diminished force that propels the portal
blood.Neither of these diseases produces dropsy early in its progress,
but, as I have seen it, always before it reaches its fatal termination.Fatty liver has not, in my observation, produced dropsy, {1174}
although I have seen livers made very large by that disease, and the
absence of dropsy when the liver has been large has aided me in
distinguishing it from the waxy disease.Cancer of the liver in some
instances does, and in others does not, produce dropsy of the bowels.It is only certain to have this result when a tumor is in position to
press upon and obstruct the portal.Hypertrophy of the liver, caused by
mitral regurgitation or other disease of the heart, does not generally
produce dropsy, but, aided by anaemia or watery condition of the blood,
such a result is possible.In children, however, it is not very rare to
see the bowels distended by dropsy, and to discover that the liver is
enlarged at the same time.It is common in such cases that the dropsy
and the hypertrophy disappear after a few weeks of treatment.This may
occur in a child that is anaemic, but without any disease of the heart.Such a case was brought to me two or three months ago, and after four
weeks of treatment by tonics and diuretics the health was
re-established.There is one point in these cases of some importance.When the child lies on his back, if the abdomen is much distended, the
liver cannot be felt.It has sunk away into the fluid, and in this
position ordinary percussion cannot ascertain its dimensions.In the
July number (1840) of a quarterly journal edited by Swett and Watson, I
published an article in which I reported the conjoined labors of the
late Camman and myself on a new method of combining auscultation and
percussion, with its results, under the heading "Auscultatory
Percussion."By the method described in that article--viz.by placing a
solid stethoscope, or for that Laennec's first stethoscope, a rolled-up
pamphlet, on the chest at a point where the liver has not fallen away
from its walls, and percussing on the abdomen from below upward--a
point is reached whence the percussion sound is brought sharply to the
ear, while half an inch below the sound is dull and distant.The lower
edge of the liver is thus easily recognized, and its upper boundary is
found in a similar manner or by ordinary percussion, so the difficulty
of measurement disappears.In such case, when the dropsy disappears and the liver recovers its
natural dimensions at the same time, the inference is that the
hypertrophy caused the dropsy, and that the hypertrophy was of the kind
called simple.The nutmeg liver is thought to have an agency in
producing dropsy, but as it is for the most part associated with
diseases that have been called dropsy-producing, its bearing on this
effusion may yet be regarded as uncertain.It is common to speak of heart dropsy in such a way as to imply that
disease of the heart alone can produce abdominal effusion.I even doubt whether the heart alone can cause the anasarca that is so
often attributed to it.In following a great multitude of heart
diseases from the time they were recognized to their termination, I
have been struck with the ease with which the patients attend to their
business, sometimes even laborious business, for years--in one instance
fifty years--with almost no complaint, and how rapidly their condition
changes as soon as albumen and casts appear in the urine.I have been
compelled by these observations to ascribe the anasarca and oedema that
makes this last stage of heart disease so distressing to the kidneys,
and not to the heart.Double pleuritic effusion is not uncommon under
these circumstances, but every physician must have noticed the rareness
of troublesome abdominal {1175} dropsy, while there is
sometimes--perhaps often--a little effusion; and when in the
exceptional cases there has been much, it was almost always accounted
for by a dropsy-producing change in the abdominal organs, not, perhaps,
discovered during life; so that for me, while they produce overwhelming
effusions in other parts of the system, they are minor agents in the
production of ascites.Phthisis is occasionally attended, toward its
close, by oedematous legs and albuminous urine, but I cannot report any
important relation between these and peritoneal effusion.I can say the
same of chronic bronchitis.I record this negative testimony regarding
the two last-named diseases, because I find them enumerated among the
causes of abdominal dropsy.Cancer may invade the portal vein, tumors of adjacent parts other than
those of the liver, or an aneurism may compress it and cause dropsy.Diseases of the pelvic organs, both acute
and chronic, may produce it, but then the disease would fall into the
class of those produced by chronic or subacute peritonitis.DaCosta thinks he has lately had a case of chronic peritonitis attended
by ascites.It was in a woman thirty years of age, who had been thrown
with force upon the frame of an iron bedstead, striking the lower part
of the bowels.These were not confined to
the injured part, but extended to the whole abdomen; and there was
menorrhagia.After a time there was fluid effusion in the peritoneal
cavity, which slowly increased till her state demanded relief from
tapping.The pain and
tenderness were constant symptoms all through.She slowly improved, and
at the time the case was reported it was believed that she would soon
be discharged from the hospital.The only doubt which DaCosta finds
regarding the diagnosis is in the facts that the liver was diminished
in size and that the spleen was moderately enlarged, and he admits the
possibility that an adventitious capsule of the liver may have caused
the ascites, but believes that it was dependent on chronic peritonitis.Acute peritonitis subsiding into chronic, with increase of fluid
effusion, as I have already said, I am not familiar with.That
occurring in cancerous and tuberculous peritonitis has already been
considered.But in relation to these some facts regarding frequency of
occurrence, collected by Bristowe, are worth quoting.He says that in
48 cases of tubercular peritonitis, dropsy was found in 12, and that in
22 of peritoneal cancer, 12 had more or less ascites.He further adds,
regarding cirrhosis, that of 46 cases observed post-mortem, there was
dropsy in only 20.This is not surprising, as in all the diseased
conditions of the liver that produce dropsy the anatomical changes must
reach the point at which there is considerable portal obstruction
before the effusion will occur.The amount of fluid found in ascites varies greatly.In some it may
remain for a long time stationary at four or five quarts; in others the
suffering caused by an accumulation of nine or ten quarts will demand
its removal; and in a few cases twenty quarts have been removed in one
operation.It is in cirrhosis that the largest quantity is found, and
it is in this disease and in cancerous peritonitis that the most
frequent tappings are required.The quality of the fluid also varies
markedly: from being almost as clear and thin as spring-water it may be
almost ropy, or in color greenish or yellowish or slightly red; it is
very likely to contain {1176} albumen; and it is probable that a
further study of its microscopic elements may enable us to resolve
doubts regarding the cause of the effusion.It very often contains
blood-corpuscles.Bristowe finds from hospital records that ascites occurs in about equal
frequency in males and females, but, as everybody has noticed, that
hepatic dropsy is much more frequent in men than in women.Ascites, he
says, is most frequent between the ages of thirty and fifty, and next
between twenty and thirty and between fifty and sixty, but is not
uncommon above the latter age; and it occurs in children.SYMPTOMS.--In general, ascites is easily recognized by the swollen
state of the bowels: a well-rounded swelling when the patient stands or
sits, but spread out in the flanks when he lies on his back; the
fulness of the side on which the patient may be lying, and the
flattened condition of the opposite side,--belong to this disease, and
as a group to no other.The results of percussion are significant in
the movement it causes in the fluid, and for the resonance or flatness
it produces.When the patient lies on his back, tapping with the
finger-ends on one side of the abdomen sends a wave of the fluid across
to the other side, where it is perceived as a gentle blow by the
applied fingers of the other hand.If the abdomen is not full, this
wave will be produced at the upper level of the fluid, but not above
that.If this wave cannot be sent across the body, it may be found on
either side by percussing above and feeling for it below; percussion
also teaches where the fluid is, and where it is not, by the dull sound
it produces.It is rare in ascites that the intestines do not float on
the surface of the fluid, at least from the umbilicus upward, and there
give a loud percussion sound, while toward the back, and often toward
the pelvis, it is dull, or even flat; changing the position of the
body, the resonance will be uppermost and the dulness in the most
dependent part.Then the softness or impressibility of the abdomen till
the tension becomes great is noticeable.The changed position of the
fluid as the body is turned from side to side is important.A very
small quantity of fluid can be detected in this manner.The patient is
placed on his right side and percussion is made in the right flank:
there is dulness, while in the left flank there is resonance.The
patient turns on to the left side: dulness now changes position, and is
on the left, and on the right resonance.If it is feared that some
undetected fluid remains in the pelvic cavity, the pelvis may be raised
by pillows and the same examination repeated, or he may be placed in
the knee-and-elbow position referred to by Bristowe, and the percussion
will then be made upward in the umbilical region.In some cases the
contraction of the mesentery will not allow the intestines to rise
through a large amount of fluid and float on it; but such cases are
almost confined to the cancerous and the tuberculous varieties of the
disease; and as in these the symptoms are grave, the physician will
probably have visited his patient many times before this contraction
will embarrass him.Besides, when mesenteric contraction occurs there
is a very strong probability that the omentum will also be contracted,
be rolled up, and lumpy; as this can almost always be felt above the
level of the umbilicus, he has in it an explanation of the absence of
resonance on the fluid.It has happened that oedema of the abdominal
walls or fatty accumulations there have given a delusive though feeble
fluctuation on percussion.In such cases, if the patient make moderate
pressure with the back of a small book in {1177} the course of the
median line, that kind of wave will be broken, while a wave in the
abdominal cavity will not be prevented.When there is considerable
distension of the abdomen by fluid, weak spots in the abdominal wall
often yield and make a tumor.This is very common at the umbilicus,
where a little bladder is lifted half an inch or more above the general
curve of the abdomen.The fluid frequently follows the track of
hernias.In females it has been known to press the anterior wall of the
vagina backward and downward, so as to make it protrude at the vulva.It has, in one of my own cases, by downward pressure caused complete
prolapse of the uterus.It is very often attended by oedema of the
lower limbs.This is accounted for by the pressure of the abdominal
fluid on the veins that return the blood from these parts, or in
cirrhosis by contraction of the ring or notch through which the vena
cava passes in the liver.If there is general oedema, the cause will
probably be found in disease of the kidneys; or if in one limb, in
pressure or thrombosis of one iliac vein.As the disease advances the
accumulating fluid forces the diaphragm upward, diminishes the
breathing room, and threatens the life still more.Then the patient
cannot lie down in bed, but spends his nights as well as days in an
easy-chair, and sleeps leaning forward on a support for his forehead.The veins on the abdominal surface will fix attention.With almost any
large tumor in the cavity they become more or less enlarged.But in
cirrhotic dropsy this becomes more striking than in any other
affection.The enlargement is attended by a reversion of the
blood-current on the lower half of the abdomen.This is early shown by
emptying an inch or two of a vein with the finger, drawing it either
upward or downward, and noticing from which direction it is refilled
when the pressure is removed.The pelvic veins do not readily discharge
their blood by the natural channels, and by anastomosing branches it is
forced over the surface of the abdomen and into the thoracic veins,
these latter becoming in turn greatly enlarged.The appetite is
commonly poor, the digestion flatulent, the pulse accelerated.The urine is commonly scanty, and in
cirrhosis of a reddish hue.The skin is apt to be dry, particularly so
in simple chronic peritonitis.The tongue has no characteristic fur,
and is often, almost always toward the close, dry.The mind is not
affected till near the end; then often the patient is delirious,
commonly mildly.Diarrhoea is not uncommon, and even dysentery has been
observed.The result is almost always unfavorable, or, as has been
said, lethal.When, as in chronic peritonitis
and in tuberculous peritonitis, the fluid is confined in a sac or sacs,
each particular pool will be yielding to pressure, but elastic, and
will give the percussion wave, though it may extend but a short
distance.To distinguish ovarian dropsy--ovarian cysts, as it is now
called--from ascites may require a few words.Ovarian tumors of all
kinds are found to be more prominent on one side when they rise from
the pelvis than on the other.The
uterus and its appendages lie in front of the pelvic intestine, and
when any of them ascend above the pelvis they must occupy the same
relative position.In other words, a large ovarian cyst must lie in
front of the intestines, while intestinal resonance should be found
behind and in the sides.But if the ovarian cyst does not occupy the
whole height of the bowels, intestinal resonance {1178} may exist above
it, and the dulness may be found below, bounded by a portion of a
circle, and sometimes the cyst walls are resisting enough to allow its
boundaries to be ascertained by the fingers.This cyst can also be felt
in the vagina; and the uterus, instead of being pressed down, is
sometimes lifted upward, so that it cannot be reached in the vagina,
but can be felt through the abdominal walls just above the pelvic
bones.A condition more troublesome than this is when ovarian cyst and
ascites occur together.Then the posterior or lateral resonance is lost
when the patient lies on her back, but can be found on one side when
she lies on the other.In that concurrence, in dorsal decubitus it is
possible by pressure or a little blow to send a wave of the ascitic
fluid over the front of the cyst.Should the patient take the knee-and-elbow position, the intestinal
resonance may be restored in both flanks.TREATMENT.--In opening the chapter on the treatment of ascites it is
usually said, Give principal consideration to the diseased conditions
that have caused the dropsy; in other words, cure cirrhosis, cancerous
peritonitis, tubercular peritonitis, heart disease, and the secondary
affections of the abdominal organs, release the liver from the
dangerous compression to which it is subjected, and all will go well.But they do not inform us how these impossibilities--at least in most
cases impossibilities--are to be achieved.It is true that the
physician would not shrink hopelessly from the treatment of simple
chronic peritonitis.But this is one of the rarest causes of ascites.A
physician in a long lifetime may not have seen a case.It is true,
ascites is a symptom, always a secondary, or even a tertiary,
affection; and theoretically there can be no better advice, but
practically it cannot amount to much.Then, if the cause cannot be
removed, it remains to do our best to relieve the patient of his load
and strive to prolong his life to its utmost possible limit.In doing
this the physician will often find himself able to give gratifying
relief, and once in a great while to rejoice in a cure.The three great emunctories, the skin, the bowels, and the kidneys, are
chiefly appealed to for relief in this as in other serous
accumulations.Most physicians prefer to use the diuretics--first,
because if they will act at all, they act so quietly and produce so
little debility that whatever can be gained by them is obtained at
small cost to the system.The form of ascites that most resists
diuretics is that which originates in cirrhosis.Often a full trial of
them, with suitable changes from time to time, is of no avail, yet now
and then the kidneys yield to persuasion and act freely.The saline
diuretics and digitalis are most in favor with some.In the early part
of the present century a pill composed of squill and digitalis in
powder, and calomel, each one grain, given three times a day, was
almost universally chosen.In place of the calomel the blue mass was
often preferred.When this prescription had produced a little ptyalism
the mercurial was omitted and the squill and digitalis continued.It
has often been observed in dropsies of all kinds that diuretics act
better after a little mercurial action is set up in the system.The
diuretic that I most frequently prescribe is made of the carbonate of
potass.ounce ss and water ounce vj; to a tablespoonful of this a
tablespoonful of fresh lemon-juice is added.This is taken every two
hours, and at the same time a dessertspoonful of the infusion of
digitalis or more is taken three times a day.This is an {1179} old
prescription.Sometimes the old sal diureticus is used.It is not always kindly received by the stomach.At Bellevue Hospital the following is much used: viz.infusion of
digitalis, ounce iv; bitartrate of potash, ounce j; simple syrup, ounce
ss; and water added to make a pint.But it
would require many pages to exhaust the diuretics.I will only add that
I have more confidence in the salts of potash and soda, singly or
combined, aided by digitalis and a mercurial, than in any others.The diaphoretics that are most efficient are warm water and steam.A
foot-bath long continued and frequently repeated, the patient covered
with blankets, and the water kept at 90 degrees or warmer, are very
effectual in producing perspiration.Bricks heated or hot water in
bottles, or potatoes heated, and enveloped in damp cloths and laid
alongside of the body and limbs, form an extemporaneous vapor-bath of
considerable efficiency.A vapor-bath can be easily extemporized in the
following way: Have a kitchen vessel furnished by the tinman with a
cover which has an inch tube fitted to this and bent so as reach the
floor six feet from the fire.The pot should have a capacity of a
gallon or more, and should be kept boiling briskly.Meantime, the
patient, in his night-dress, has a double blanket brought over his
shoulders from behind, and another from before, and fastened.Now he
takes a chair (wooden), under which the steam is delivered.The blanket
from behind is kept off his body by the back of the chair, and the
front one by his knees.The steam, shut in in this way, soon brings on
a sweat, and when it is sufficiently active the front blanket is thrown
off, and the patient wrapped in the rear one and put to bed, when the
sweating can be regulated by blankets.This is better than what is
called the alcohol sweat, for in that the patient is bathed in carbonic
acid gas as well as heat.A patient is sometimes enveloped in a hot,
wet blanket with good effect.Pilocarpine has come into use lately as a
sudorific.I have witnessed its effects many times and can testify to
its certainty as a sudorific; but it is too debilitating for common
use.Digitalis has sometimes acted with extraordinary power in this
way, but there are grave risks in administering large doses.Among the cathartics that may be used in ascites, it has seemed to me
that the milder hydragogues are safest.One ounce of Epsom salts with a
drachm of the fluid extract of senna can be taken every second or third
day for months, if need be, with little reduction of strength, and
sometimes with an increase of it.I had charge of a young man in the
hospital in whom cirrhosis was unquestionable, and dropsy at one time
extreme, in whom the abdominal veins had made furrows that would
receive the little finger, who was wholly relieved by a drastic dose of
elaterium every second day.I saw him three years after his discharge,
and then his health was good.Notwithstanding this, I prefer the milder
medicines.Bristowe has seen no cures from either sudorifics, diuretics, or
purgatives.I have seen one or more from each of those agents, all
cirrhotic.He "has seen cures occasionally from mercury, iodide and
bromide of potash, copaiba, and a combination of fresh squills and
crude mercury."I agree with him in his statement that
counter-irritants are useless, making exception for chronic peritonitis
and the early stage of the tubercular variety.He thinks quinia, iron,
and cod-liver oil are useful.{1180} Paracentesis in almost every case will at length become
necessary, and the question comes whether it should be practised early
or late.If it be delayed till the oppression of the breathing makes it
imperative, the walls of the abdomen will be so stretched as to present
little resistance to the reaccumulation of the fluid, and a second
tapping will be required in fifteen to twenty-five days.A bandage is a
poor substitute for muscular contraction.If, on the other hand, the
fluid is withdrawn before the muscularity is not stretched out of the
muscles, then accumulation will be less rapid and the patient will be
spared the suffering which large accumulations cause.But tapping is
not always an innocent operation.It is sometimes followed by acute
peritonitis.By the early tapping this risk is oftener taken.Reginald
Smith suggests the use of a small canula by which only ten or twenty
ounces of the fluid can escape each hour.This mode, he thinks, removes
the danger of syncope and makes the bandage needless.Hemorrhagic Effusion

in the peritoneum is a topic on which there is little to be said.A
primary effusion of this kind probably does not occur.In
haematophilia, where the mucous membrane of the nose and wounds bleed
dangerously, there is no record of spontaneous bleeding into the
peritoneal cavity.The same thing can be said of that very rare disease
which has been called bloody sweat.An unmarried lady applied to me
fifteen years ago with this disorder.The blood would ooze out at
hundreds of points on the inner face of the arm; these would run
together and drop off the arm, or the same thing would occur on the
chest and in the bend of the knee.This would continue for two or three
minutes, and then cease of itself, but to recur in one or more, rarely
several, places.There was no
irregularity of the menses.I could find no visceral disease; there was
no nose-bleed.This kind of
bleeding continued for several years.She is now approaching fifty
years of age, and for the last two or three years has had no recurrence
of the bleeding.There was never anything in this case to lead to the
suspicion of peritoneal or other serous hemorrhage.In the few similar
cases on record there is the same absence of all evidence of internal
bleeding.It has already been said that a certain amount of blood, as shown by
its corpuscles, is to be expected in cancerous ascites, and with less
uniformity in tubercular ascites, and not unfrequently in hepatic
dropsy, as well as in acute peritonitis.This may not deserve to be
called hemorrhage, on account of the moderate quantity of blood that is
effused; but aside from that which results from rupture of
blood-vessels it is about the only kind of it with which we are
familiar.Scurvy, and conditions of the blood analogous to those produced by that
disease, make it almost certain that if pleurisy or pericarditis occurs
while these conditions exist, it will be hemorrhagic.I am not,
personally, acquainted with a single instance in which peritonitis in
this condition has occurred.Copeland, however, says that hemorrhage in
peritonitis has been noticed by Broussais and others.The blood is
mixed {1181} with the serum and stains the surface of the false
membrane, as in hemorrhagic pleurisy and pericarditis, and the disease
is of an asthenic type, "occurring in the hemorrhagic diathesis.""The
symptoms are inflammatory from the beginning, and rapidly pass into
those indicating great depression; the pulse becomes rapid, small, and
soft, death quickly supervening, with convulsions, cold and damp
extremities and surface," etc.Copeland has himself not seen a case, and regards its occurrence as
very rare.Delafield states that "Friedreich describes two cases
occurring in patients with ascites who had been frequently tapped.He
says that both the parietal and visceral peritoneum was covered with a
continuous membrane of a diffuse, yellowish-brown color, mottled with
small and large extravasations of blood.The membrane was thickest over
the anterior abdominal wall.It could be separated into a number of
layers.These layers were composed of blood-vessels, masses of pigment,
branching cells, and fibrillated basement substance.In many places the
extravasated blood was coagulated in the shape of round, hard, black
nodules.The new membrane could be readily stripped off from the
peritoneum, and there were no adhesions between the visceral and
parietal portions of the peritoneum."The erosions of abdominal cancer sometimes open vessels of considerable
size, causing large hemorrhage into this cavity and sudden death.When aneurisms of the abdominal aorta rupture, they sometimes flood the
abdominal cavity; oftener they open into the structures under the
peritoneum on the left side, and make a large flat tumor extending from
the point of rupture downward to the brim of the pelvis, and even
beyond it.A gentleman whose health was usually good, thirty-five years of age,
felt an unwonted exhaustion and feebleness creeping over him.His
countenance became pale, his pulse rapid, growing smaller and smaller.It seemed certain that there was hemorrhage somewhere, but until it was
noticed that the bowels were growing tumid and hard there was nothing
to guide us to its seat.Even then we were left to conjecture regarding
the bleeding vessel.After
death it was found that a small aneurism had been formed on one of the
vessels of the omentum, not larger than a small walnut, and had
ruptured by a very small opening, and that it was by this small opening
that life had oozed away.Bleedings from stabs and other wounds of the bowels, from lacerations
of the liver, spleen, uterus, and sometimes of the kidneys, should be
mentioned in this connection; but as they, for the most part, fall into
the hands of the surgeons, this is not the place to give the details
regarding them.{1182}

DISEASES OF THE ABDOMINAL GLANDS (TABES MESENTERICA).BY SAMUEL C. BUSEY, M.D.DEFINITION.--Tabes mesenterica may be briefly defined to be
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.This definition may seem too
limited, because it recognizes the identity of tuberculosis and
scrofulosis of the lymph-glands, and excludes those hyperplastic
conditions which do not certainly undergo the cheesy degeneration.It
is supported, however, by the absence of any essential difference in
the histological changes which take place in tuberculous and scrofulous
(Wagner) lymph-glands; by the frequent simultaneous occurrence of each
in the same subject; by the secondary development of tubercles during
the course of scrofulous affections; and by the fact that the cheesy
transformation is alike common to both these conditions of new
formations.Schuppel maintains that the presence of tubercles is
necessary to the production of the cheesy metamorphosis of
lymph-glands, and that "scrofulous glands are always tuberculous
glands."In this view Rindfleisch coincides, and expresses the belief
that the inflammatory and hyperplastic changes are secondary to the
formation of the tubercles.Birch-Hirschfeld asserts that cheesy
degeneration of the mesenteric glands is always accompanied by
tubercular formations.This definition is therefore adopted as the expression of the result of
the most recent investigations.It must, nevertheless, be admitted that
a few equally competent observers deny the identity of the tuberculous
and scrofulous new formations in lymph-glands.It must also be conceded
that occasionally hyperplastic processes in the lymph-glands undergo
the cheesy metamorphosis independent of tubercular development.SYNONYMS.--The differences of opinion, especially among the older
authors, in regard to the nature of this disease are very distinctly
indicated in the varying significance of the numerous synonyms, of
which the following list is only a part: Atrophia mesenterica; Atrophia
infantum (Hoffmann); Febris hectica infantum (Sydenham); Scrofula
mesenterica (Sauvages); Paralysma mesentericum (Good); Physconia
mesenterica (Baumes); Mesenteritis chronica (Stewart); Mesenteric
fever, Hectic fever, Marasmus (Underwood); Carreau, Entero-mesenterite
of the French; Darrsucht der Kinder and Gekroschwindsucht of the
Germans; Tubercles of the mesentery; Tuberculous disease of the
abdomen; Phthisis mesenterica; Tabes glandularis; Tabes scrofulosa;
Macies infantum; Paedatrophia; and Rachialgia mesenterica.{1183} Some of these synonyms indicate the theoretical and unsupported
opinions of their authors, and others refer merely to a symptom.The
name carreau refers to a hardness of the abdomen; physconia, to the
presence of a non-fluctuating and non-sonorous abdominal tumor; and
that of entero-mesenterite presupposes a secondary origin from a
primary enteritis.Good classes it among his numerous varieties of
mesenteric turgescence, but characterizes this special form as a
scrofulous turgescence always associated with the strumous diathesis.The terms tabes and atrophy originated when the nomenclature of disease
was derived from symptoms, and not from pathology.HISTORY AND PATHOLOGY.--The history of tabes mesenterica is coeval with
that of scrofula and pulmonary consumption.The ancient authors
recognized the existence of a chronic disease of the mesenteric glands,
characterized by enlargement and induration, followed by destruction of
the gland-parenchyma, which was associated with digestive disturbances,
emaciation, hectic fever, and usually terminated in death.At first,
the degenerative process was regarded as suppurative.But as the study
of scrofula progressed, and frequent observations were made of the
occurrence of disease of the external lymphatics and of the mesenteric
glands in the same subject, disputes arose as to the identity of the
two affections.These controversies led to the general acceptance of
the belief that the scrofulous degeneration of lymph-glands and the
process of destruction in tabes mesenterica were identical.Consentaneous with these investigations, and for a long time
subsequent, even down to a very late period, which is, perhaps, not yet
concluded, the relation of scrofulous disease of the lymph-glands to
pulmonary consumption was discussed and studied with great assiduity.As the knowledge concerning these diseases advanced, and the results of
investigations were accepted, the doctrine of the identity of the
morbid processes in scrofulous disease of the external glands and
mesenteric phthisis became firmly established.The history of
scrofulosis and tuberculosis cannot be separated.The connection and
identification of the two processes have been subjects of constant
discussion from the discovery of tubercle to the present time.Occasionally, the dividing-line seemed definitely fixed.Then would
follow the general acceptance of the doctrine of identity.With the
discovery of miliary tubercle a determined reaction took place against
this view, and for a while many regarded scrofulosis merely as a form
or stage of tuberculosis.As the conclusions in regard to these
questions changed, so did the opinions concerning the true nature of
tabes mesenterica change, until, finally, the investigations of
Rindfleisch, Schuppel, and others seem to have established the
tuberculous nature of the disease.Many authors of a comparatively
recent date have applied the term tuberculosis to this condition, not
because they knew or believed the development of true tubercle was a
constant or essential characteristic, but because they regarded the
words scrofulosis and tuberculosis as synonymous.Notwithstanding the obscurity in which, for so long a time, the
pathology of this disease was involved, certain facts well known to the
earliest writers have been confirmed by continuous observation down to
the present.Its secondary character has been so uniformly recognized
that some of the older authors based its origin upon the absorption and
conveyance along the lymphatic vessels to the glands of some peccant
material originating {1184} in a primary focus of disease.The constant
coexistence with scrofulous affections and pulmonary consumption had
long ago established the direct and primary relation of these diseases
to tabes mesenterica, and authors of recent date, though not so
generally holding the opinion that it is always an intercurrent
complication of these maladies, yet maintain its secondary development.Even Schuppel, whose investigations and conclusions lead in the
direction of an idiopathic origin, admits that the only primary element
is the tuberculosis, which finds its cause in some peripheral
irritation.In the earlier times, as now, tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands has
been observed during every period of life from birth to advanced old
age, but then, as at the present time, the greater number of cases were
known to occur during infancy and childhood.But few cases have been
observed during the earlier months of life or before weaning.Between
the ages of two and eight years is the period of greatest frequency.Though rarer during the later years of childhood, the older the child
the more rapid its progress to a fatal termination.Nursing infants are
not exempt, but those nursed by healthy mothers are much less liable
than the wet-nursed.Among hand-fed infants it is not an uncommon
disease, but it is much more common among the farmed-out children.While, as has been stated, the greatest number of cases occur in those
between two and eight years of age, statistics show that the liability
to it increases from the age of two and a half years up to the eighth,
and, according to some authors, up to the tenth year.At the latter age
there is a remarkable diminution in the number of cases.This fact is
probably due to the greater prevalence of the acute diseases of the
respiratory organs and of the exanthematous diseases among children
during this period of life.Some have attributed it to the more rapid
development and increased functional activity of the mesenteric glands.This circumstance might afford a plausible explanation for the apparent
sudden increase in frequency after the completion of the second year
because of the independent subsistence of children at that age, and the
additional duties imposed upon the alimentary tract and its
dependencies; still, if this were so, the period of greatest frequency
ought to begin at an earlier age and more nearly correspond with the
time of weaning.It is, however, a fact that tubercularization of the
mesenteric glands is more frequently associated with chronic intestinal
inflammation in those over one year than in those under that age.This
fact, together with the greater liability of artificially-fed infants,
would seem to connect, at least in such cases, its secondary origin
with some primary irritation of the intestinal canal.Authors are not yet agreed in regard to the relative frequency of this
disease in boys and girls, though opinions predominate in favor of the
greater number among the males.The statistics of Rilliet and Barthez
and Schmalz show a decidedly greater prevalence among boys.The comparative frequency of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands
cannot be determined.Louis found disease of the mesenteric glands in
one-fourth of the autopsies of persons dying of phthisis; in 100 adults
dying of the same disease Lombard found tuberculosis of these glands in
10; and in the bodies of 100 tuberculous children he found the glands
tuberculous in 34 cases.In the Hopital des Enfants Maladies tubercles
were found in the mesentery of one-half of the children dying of {1185}
tuberculous affections.In the bodies of children dying of tuberculous
disease in the Children's Hospital of Washington tuberculous
degeneration of the mesenteric glands has been found in two-thirds of
the cases, and without a single exception in those dying of rickets.Authors differ also, and the statistics are equally unreliable, in
regard to the relative frequency of tubercularization of the bronchial
and mesenteric glands.The general opinion seems to be in favor of the
greater frequency in the bronchial glands.In a majority of cases both
sets of glands are found diseased.The geographical distribution of tabes mesenterica is as universal as
that of scrofula and pulmonary phthisis.No country or climate is
exempt, yet there is no locality in which it is endemic.It has been
observed among all civilized nations, in the cold regions as well as in
the tropical countries.Wherever scrofulous and phthisical diseases are
known, there also are found cases of tabes mesenterica.Livingstone has
stated that scrofula is unknown in some regions in Central Africa, and
other travellers have made similar statements in regard to some Indian
tribes.The statistics of the Children's Hospital of Washington show a
far greater frequency among the African race than among the whites.It
belongs to no class or condition of life, but occurs more frequently
among the children of the squalid than among the children of the
affluent and well-to-do.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--Modern as well as the older authors
have very generally accepted the conclusion that a constitutional
tendency or liability to this disease is its most frequent and
potential etiological factor.This predisposition may be either
inherited or acquired.The ancients called it the strumous, and the
more recent writers the scrofulous or tuberculous, diathesis.Lugol
maintained that this diathesis is begotten of old and syphilitic
fathers, and others state that children of parents nearly related and
of those broken down by disease and excesses may inherit it.That it is
transmitted by scrofulous and phthisical parents no one can doubt, but
as yet it cannot be defined to be anything more than a peculiarity of
the constitution which may exhibit abnormal reactions against
irritating influences.The scrofulous habit is believed to be indicated
by physical appearances which represent two extremes.The erethic form
is characterized by a feeble and delicate frame; deficient muscular
development; transparent, smooth, and florid skin; light hair and blue
eyes, large pupils; precocious intellect and sanguine temperament; the
torpid form, by a large head; large and tumid upper lip; soft and
flaccid flesh, bloated appearance; short and thick neck; muscular
incapacity, tumid abdomen, and sluggish intellect.Some of these
features are more frequently symptoms of the actual disease than of the
existence of a predisposition to it, and, except so far as they may
refer to a primary scrofulous or pulmonary disease, cannot be accepted
as indicative of the presence of a constitutional tendency to
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.A tumid abdomen, rapid
emaciation, and anaemia are far more valuable signs of the disease of
these glands.Bad air and bad food are also important predisposing causes.They are
conditions to which the children of the poor, especially in large
cities, are constantly exposed.Insufficient protection from climatic
influences, neglect of person, and unhygienic surroundings must be
classed in the same category.It is claimed that vitiated air,
unwholesome habitation, {1186} insufficient or improper food, squalor
and filth may cause the constitutional tendency, as they will certainly
precipitate the development of the disease in those predisposed to it.Exciting Causes.--The border-line between the predisposing and exciting
causes cannot be positively fixed.The presence of tuberculosis or of
some form of scrofulous disease in some other part of the body so
constantly precedes the development of tuberculosis of the mesenteric
glands, even in those who have not exhibited the characteristic
phenomena of the scrofulous diathesis, that such affections must be
regarded as exciting as well as predisposing causes.No one can doubt
the frequent infection of the mesenteric glands in cases of pulmonary
tuberculosis.The probability of systemic infection from a single focus
is universally admitted.These facts and circumstances do not exclude
the possibility of localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.Whether such exclusively local development of tubercles ever occurs
independent of the scrofulous diathesis cannot be determined, but that
the disease does find its exciting cause in inflammatory conditions of
the intestinal mucous membrane cannot be doubted.Schuppel, who asserts
the primary development of the tubercle-formation in lymphatic glands,
does not claim an idiopathic origin, but admits the necessity of a
primary peripheral irritation in direct connection with the affected
gland.The intimate connection between diseases of the intestinal
mucous membrane and of the mesenteric glands is established beyond a
doubt.Vogel and Steiner assert that tabes mesenterica is a common
result of enteritis folliculosa.A primary inflammatory process may not
contain any element which could be classed as tubercle, yet it may
excite secondary tuberculosis of the glands.Whether such a result only
occurs in those who may have acquired or inherited the predisposition
is yet undecided.In many of the cases of tabes mesenterica tuberculous
ulcers are found in the intestines, but it cannot be claimed that such
ulcers are always the primary foci of tuberculous development.If
primary, it is not difficult to understand how the virus may be
transmitted to the glands.It has been claimed that certain articles of food will produce the
disease.Potatoes and rye bread in large quantities and a coarse
vegetable diet have been mentioned among the exciting causes.Deficiency in the quantity of food is a much more frequent cause than
inferiority in quality, yet there can be no doubt that any and every
article of diet that will set up catarrhal inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane may become a cause.Irritation of the mucous
membrane of the alimentary tract, induced by coarse, stimulating, or
imperfectly-digested food, or by the improper and frequent use of
purgative medicines, may give rise to disease of the glands; and, even
though the irritation may in itself be trivial, its long continuance or
frequent renewal may prove sufficient, especially in those in whom the
predisposition is present.Malarial and exanthematous diseases have
also been considered exciting causes, and among the latter class
measles and scarlet fever, because of the inflamed condition of the
intestinal mucous membrane which they leave, are the most frequent.Difficult dentition and whooping cough must also be classed in this
category.Recently attention has been called to the probable transmission of the
disease through the milk of diseased cows, but further investigation
and {1187} more reliable data are necessary to establish this
connection.Klebs has deduced the conclusion from recent experiments
that the use of the milk of cows in advanced phthisis will always
produce tuberculosis, which begins as an intestinal catarrh and extends
to the mesenteric glands.Some of the older authors believed that the cure of some chronic
diseases of the skin and mucous membranes and the suppression of
chronic discharges might induce tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands;
but these conditions are now known to be most frequently the initial
manifestations of the scrofulous diathesis, and the mesenteric
complications are far more likely to occur when these primary foci are
neglected and the patient is left to suffer the unabated progress of
the disease.MORBID ANATOMY.--It is not usual to find all the glands of the
mesentery affected at once, nor of those affected all in the same stage
of disease.Newly-affected glands may be found alongside of others in
an advanced condition.In the first stage the glands are enlarged, but
rarely exceeding the size of a filbert; they are firm, but not
inelastic.This change consists in hyperplasia of the
gland-constituents.Microscopic examination shows abundant
cell-proliferation, but the cells are badly constructed and prone to
undergo retrogressive metamorphosis.The cells accumulate in clusters
without any intercellular substance, and compress the lymph-sinuses and
blood-vessels.The second stage is characterized by the commencement of the cheesy
degeneration.The glands enlarge and coalesce in clusters, sometimes
forming large masses of hardened and inelastic glands.On section they
exhibit in the beginning foci of cheesy material imbedded in the
gland-parenchyma.In the further progress of the change the whole gland
is transformed into a homogeneous yellowish substance.In this
condition there are found on microscopic examination globular
corpuscles, nuclei, shrivelled cells, sometimes giant-cells, and most
frequently tubercles.The tubercles are usually found in the follicular
substance.Birch-Hirschfield says the cheesy formations in secondary
tuberculous mesenteric glands are only found in discrete foci, and the
tubercles occur in the follicular substance imbedded in relatively
normal tissue.The cheesy transformation is, according to Virchow, a
necrobiosis of the hyperplastic gland-elements, but Schuppel insists
that it is the result of tubercular development.After a time the
cheesy masses soften, and the glands are converted into sacs containing
a purulent fluid mixed with debris.In this condition they are most
frequently coalesced in bunches, sometimes forming large tumors.The
intervening walls may break down and the whole bunch be transformed
into one large sac filled with purulent fluid and debris.Occasionally
these masses of agglutinated glands become adherent to the abdominal
parietes or to the intestines.Rupture of their walls may occur, and
the contents may be emptied into either the peritoneal cavity or the
intestines.When communication with the intestines takes place, it is
usually through an ulcer on the mucous surface.It is probable that the
cheesy substance may sometimes be absorbed, as Virchow thinks, by
gradual softening proceeding from the surface toward the centre.It is believed that these degenerated glands sometimes undergo the
cretaceous transformation.Such an instance has been reported by
Carswell: "The patient, who when a child had been affected with tabes
{1188} mesenterica and also with swellings of the cervical glands, some
of which ulcerated, died at the age of twenty-one years of inflammation
of the uterus seven days after delivery.Several of the mesenteric
glands contained a dry cheesy matter mixed with a chalky-looking
substance; others were composed of a cretaceous substance; and a tumor
as large as a hen's egg, included within the folds of the peritoneum,
and which appeared to be the remains of a large agglomerated mass of
glands, was filled with a substance resembling a mixture of putty and
dried mortar, moistened with a small quantity of serosity.In the neck,
and immediately behind an old cicatrix in the skin, there were two
glands containing, in several points of their substance, small masses
of hard cretaceous matter."Calcareous concretions have been observed
by Andral and others in the mesenteric glands in cases of chronic
pulmonary disease; and Soemmering records several observations of a
tartar-like substance found in devastated mesenteric glands in cases of
rickets.The morbid appearances in tabes mesenterica are not usually confined to
the changes in the glands.In very many cases the evidences of disease
of the peripheral glands are quite manifest, and in much the larger
number of cases pulmonary phthisis and disease of the bronchial glands
are present.These
consecutive morbid changes are succinctly set forth in the following
notes of an autopsy taken from the records of the Children's Hospital
of Washington, D.C.The subject was a <DW64> boy aged ten, who had been
taken sick a year previous to his death with a bad cold and cough,
followed several months afterward by enlargement and suppuration of the
cervical glands on both sides: "The body was greatly emaciated, the
lips and teeth covered with sordes.Cheesy masses were scattered
throughout the substance of both lungs.The right lung was firmly
adherent to the thoracic walls, the left adherent at apex.The liver
was enlarged and adherent to all adjacent tissues, and contained many
cheesy nodules scattered throughout its substance and over the surface.The gall-bladder was distended with bile.The spleen was normal in
size, very dark, and filled with cheesy masses.The pancreas contained
many similar masses.The peritoneal cavity contained a quantity of
muddy fluid.The peritoneum was dark in color, studded with tubercles,
and ulcerated in a few places.The stomach and intestines were
distended with gas; the walls of stomach thickened, the inner surface
covered with a shiny mucus; in its lower wall was one large ulcer,
penetrating to the peritoneal coat and measuring three-fourths of an
inch in diameter.The peritoneal coat was thickly studded with nodules
resembling tubercles.The small intestines were gangrenous in a few
places; on the inner surface were found fourteen ulcers, varying in
size from one-fourth to one and one-fourth inches in diameter, with
elevated edges and red bases; two penetrated the peritoneal coat.On the mucous surface of the large
intestines there were seven large ulcers, similar in appearance to
those found in the small intestines.Some of Peyer's patches were
ulcerated.The mesenteric glands, some as large as walnuts, were filled
with cheesy material, and the mesentery was dotted over with small
masses of similar matter."In two of the reported cases of chylous effusion into the peritoneal
cavity the rupture of the lacteals was caused by degeneration of the
{1189} mesenteric glands; and in several other cases the rupture was
produced by the presence of tumors, apparently formed by the
agglomeration of numerous degenerated glands.Several cases of fatty diarrhoea from mesenteric phthisis have been
reported.Of these the most conclusive is the case of Hall.[1] The
clinical history of the case and the detection of enlarged mesenteric
glands in the umbilical and hypogastric regions placed the diagnosis
beyond a doubt.It was, however, verified by the discovery of several
vomicae in the lungs, and of mesenteric glands "universally enlarged
and affected with strumous disease.The intestinal mucous membrane was
dotted with patches of ulceration, with here and there prominent masses
of strumous deposit on the surface."[Footnote 1: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, vol.i., 3d Series, 1855, p.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--It is not possible to describe a definite and uniform
clinical history of this disease.As a secondary complication of
pulmonary phthisis and scrofulous affections the preliminary symptoms
are so constantly identified with the development and progress of these
maladies that, as a rule, the initial stage cannot be recognized by any
special assemblage of symptoms.In any tuberculous or scrofulous child
the possible implication of the mesenteric glands may be predicated
upon any array of symptoms that would establish the presence of these
classes of disease.And even in the absence of the rational and direct
signs of such affections, in those exhibiting the physical evidences of
the strumous diathesis, more especially when it is inherited, the
symptoms of any trivial departure from health, such as the catching of
cold, irritation of the alimentary tract, or protracted convalescence
from any of the exanthematous or intestinal diseases, may constitute
the initial history of tabes mesenterica.In such subjects debility and
anaemia, from whatsoever cause they may apparently result--and, in
fact, any manifest lowering of the standard of health, whether gradual
or precipitate, and without assignable cause--may mark the beginning of
the process of change in the parenchyma of the glands that will
terminate in tuberculosis.The later as well as the earlier history may
be completely masked by the symptomatology of other diseases belonging
to the tuberculous class; and so grave, as a rule, are such primary and
coexisting affections that definite recognition of this complication or
localized extension of the systemic infection becomes more a matter of
skilful diagnosis than of practical utility.But in those cases where disease of the respiratory organs and of the
bronchial glands can be excluded the general symptomatology becomes of
paramount importance.And in view of the value of prophylactic measures
which may be employed to arrest, limit, or delay the localized
tuberculosis of these glands, the precursory symptoms may be of special
significance.This condition may be characterized by languor and
dulness or marked debility and anaemia, with loss of color, attended
with flatulence, stomachal disturbance, frequent eructations consisting
mainly of mucus, a sense of uneasiness in the abdomen after the
ingestion of food, a variable appetite, sometimes voracious and
occasionally depraved.Sometimes a dislike for fatty foods is a
prominent symptom.The tongue may be coated, the breath is usually
foul, and some have said the body emits an acid odor.If these symptoms
occur in a child of the {1190} scrofulous diathesis, or be directly or
remotely associated with a previous gastro-intestinal disease, or occur
or persist during the convalescence of some of the acute affections of
infancy and childhood which stand in etiological relation to this
disease, they may justify a reasonable presumption of commencing change
in the mesenteric glands.This presumption will be strengthened by
emaciation, a more marked disturbance of the digestive function,
attended with fetid and occasionally whitish stools, a tumid belly, and
deep, lancinating abdominal pains of short duration, recurring at long
intervals and neither relieved nor aggravated by pressure or an
evacuation.Some have attributed special importance to a chalky
appearance and loss of consistency of the stools, indicating the
suspension of absorption by the lacteals.There may also be slight
evening fever.Later, the enlargement of the belly increases, the
emaciation becomes more marked and rapid, the appetite more variable,
sometimes very voracious, the alvine discharges more fetid or less
consistent, sometimes putty-like, and generally irregular or
constipated.The febrile exacerbations are more decided, and sometimes
chills may occur at irregular intervals.When, in addition to these
symptoms, either during the earlier or later stages, the enlargement of
the glands can be detected, the clinical picture is complete.In
consequence of the tympanitic distension of the abdomen, which usually
increases with the progress of the disease, it is impossible in a
majority of cases to detect the glandular enlargement; especially is
this true when the affected glands are separate; but, as frequently
happens during the last stage, when large tumors are formed by the
coalescence of a number of diseased glands the diagnosis may be easily
determined.In the absence of the discovery of enlarged glands the
diagnosis cannot be considered positive.They are usually most readily
found in the region of the umbilicus, and may in some cases, even when
the tension of the abdomen is very great, be detected by grasping the
abdomen with the hand and compressing it between the fingers and thumb
so that the enlarged glands will be brought in close contiguity to the
walls and be felt immediately under the fingers.If a tumor should be
present and the peritoneal cavity be free from fluid, its locality may
be recognized by a sense of resistance and circumscribed area of
diminished resonance, and then definitely outlined by palpation.Underwood says: "Indigestion, costiveness or purging, irregular
appetite, flushed cheeks or a total loss of color, impaired strength
and spirits, remitting fever, and a hard and tumid belly, with
emaciated limbs, are amongst the more common symptoms, attending at one
period or other, of this disease."When the diagnosis has been made out, it is not impossible to determine
the stage of the disease.The progressive intensity of the symptoms,
with rapid emaciation as a rule, bears a definite relation to the
progress of the morbid changes taking place in the glands.It must,
however, be borne in mind that children have died of tabes mesenterica
who had enjoyed excellent health up to the moment of death, and the
autopsy disclosed the condition of the glands, which had not been
suspected during life.In the case previously cited, in which the
autopsy exhibited such grave lesions of the stomach, liver, spleen,
pancreas, and intestinal mucous membrane, the clinical phenomena were
at no time commensurate with the gravity of the morbid changes.{1191} DIAGNOSIS.--In the absence of the proof of the presence of
enlarged glands or of a tumor the diagnosis cannot be positively
determined.The enlargement and tympanitic distension of the abdomen do
not necessarily establish the existence of glandular disease, for they
are present in a great many conditions of ill-health in children.Nor
is the coexistence of a tumid belly, emaciation, and fever sufficient,
for they are found in other tuberculous and in gastro-intestinal
diseases.The discovery of enlarged discrete glands by palpation, as
before described, in connection with such disturbances of nutrition as
have been set forth, constitute the strongest presumption in favor of
tabes mesenterica.The presence of enlarged glands unaccompanied by the
ordinary symptoms of the tuberculous or scrofulous processes is
inconclusive, because the glandular hypertrophy may be a simple
hyperplasia, entirely independent of any tendency to retrogressive
metamorphosis.There is usually some tenderness on pressure, but this
may be present in any disease of the abdominal viscera.When the glands
are of sufficient size, they may, by pressure, produce secondary
derangements.Cramps in the legs may be caused by pressure on nerves.Oedema of the legs and dilatation of the superficial abdominal veins
may result from compression of venous trunks."If," says Eustace Smith,
"these veins are seen to ramify on the abdominal surface and to join
the veins on the thoracic walls, tabes may be suspected in the absence
of chronic peritonitis and enlargement of the liver."Ascites may be
present, but is not a necessary result of disease of the glands.When a tumor has been discovered by palpation, it is necessary to
determine its glandular nature.If situated about the umbilicus, in
front of the spinal column, if irregular, hard, and feeling like a
congeries of irregularly-rounded nodules, the evidence is very decided
in favor of its glandular origin.But care must be taken to exclude
tumors formed by fecal accumulations and masses attached to the
omentum.Omental tumors are usually more movable, better defined, more
superficial, and regular in form.Cancerous masses sometimes simulate
glandular tumors.The general history of the case and the age of the
patient are usually sufficient to make a diagnosis by exclusion.Rilliet and Barthez distinguished a cancerous pancreas by the presence
of vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pains.The writer has many times based a conjectural diagnosis--which was
verified by a post-mortem examination--upon the presence of a tumid
abdomen, increasing emaciation, with the history of a protracted
gastro-intestinal catarrh, and an irregular febrile curve characterized
by frequent subnormal temperatures.He has also observed a number of
cases of protracted diarrhoea in children, accompanied with extreme
emaciation, notwithstanding the appetite was good, sometimes even
voracious, and the food taken was ample, nutritious, and easily
digested, in which the stools, varying from two to three, or twice as
many, daily, were whitish, leaden, or slate-, sometimes
semi-fluid, at other times containing lumps or masses of putty
consistence, presenting to the naked eye a greasy appearance and to the
touch a fatty feel, and at the autopsy has found only thinness and
transparency of the coat of the small intestines and degenerated
mesenteric glands.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is decidedly unfavorable.So far as is known
to the writer, there is but one recorded case of recovery in which the
{1192} diagnosis was indisputable and the fact of a cure was
established by an autopsy.This was the case reported by Carswell,
before referred to.The older and some of the modern authors have
claimed many recoveries, but it must be manifest to every student of
pathological anatomy that the mistaken diagnoses must have been nearly
if not quite as numerous as the cases of cure.The writer has not
witnessed a single case of recovery, but he has observed very many
cured cases of disease which exhibited all the subjective and objective
symptoms of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands, save and except
those by which its existence can alone be definitely and positively
established.The case of Carswell demonstrates a remote possibility of
cure by the cretaceous metamorphosis of the degenerated glands in a
subject exhibiting the scrofulous diathesis.In view of this isolated
observation, one cannot refuse to accept a similar possibility in cases
in which the disease may be localized and confined to a few of the
glands.In such cases, if recognized previous to the formation of
cheesy foci, the possibility of staying, limiting, and perhaps
occasionally curing, the disease should not be regarded as absolutely
hopeless; yet the opportunities of examining the glands in the first
stage of change has so rarely occurred that no one is authorized to
assert that the hyperplasia is the true picture of the condition in
which those in the advanced stage had its beginning; nor has any one
claimed to have witnessed the progressive stages of resolution taking
place in such glands.The cretaceous transformation is an accepted though remote possibility,
and absorption by means of gradual softening of the cheesy masses is
perhaps a reasonable hypothesis.But even if either of these processes
was an occasional termination of the disease, it could only lessen its
gravity and prolong life, with an incomplete recovery, in those few
cases in which the tuberculous or scrofulous changes were confined to a
less number of glands than was necessary to maintain the nutrition of
the body.For while there is no serious obstacle to the flow of chyle
through the glands in the condition of simple hyperplasia, it is
completely obstructed in those transformed into cheesy masses or
purulent collections.The channels through the glands must sooner or
later be obliterated by the presence of the abundant cell-proliferation
which characterizes the initial stage of change in this disease.For if
the compression is sufficient to cut off the supply of blood, it must
prove equally destructive to the complex system of lymph-paths.To the
impermeability of the glands must the emaciation and exhaustion which
mark the course of the disease, to a greater or less degree according
to the number of glands involved, be due.If the investigations of Schuppel should be verified, and the primary
tubercle-formations be accepted as the initial stage of change, the
prognosis will be less favorable, but a distinct line of demarcation
may be established between two classes of cases in each of which cheesy
transformation may occur, but in one the tubercle-formations may be
primary, and in the other secondary.In the latter class the prognosis
may be more favorable, because treatment may be effective if commenced
prior to the beginning of the retrogressive metamorphosis.COURSE, DURATION, AND COMPLICATIONS.--When tabes is a complication of
pulmonary or bronchial phthisis, or when either of the latter {1193}
diseases appears as an intercurrent affection during the course of a
primary localized tuberculosis of these glands, the glandular
degeneration runs a more rapid course.When it appears as an extension
of external scrofulous affections or finds its cause in
gastro-intestinal irritation, its course is usually less rapid.The
number of glands involved greatly influences its duration.The
mechanical impediment to nutrition offered by a large number of
impermeable glands promotes rapid emaciation and exhaustion.The
condition of the mucous coat of the alimentary tract offers many
considerations that affect its course and duration.Follicular
enteritis hastens, and tuberculous ulceration of the mucous membrane
speedily brings, the case to a fatal termination.Some of the older authors refer to the frequent complication of rickets
with tabes mesenterica, and the writer in numerous post-mortem
examinations of the bodies of children dying of rickets has invariably
found cheesy mesenteric glands.In view of the fact that rickets is
constantly associated with disturbance of the alimentary tract, it
should not be a surprise to find the glands in such close contiguity
to, and having vascular communication with, the diseased mucous surface
in a condition of hyperplasia.Simple hypertrophy is probably a common
complication in cases which terminate by recovery, but there must be
some element of cause, other than inflammation of the mucous membrane
of the intestines, that determines the retrogressive metamorphosis.Several of the older authors have classed rickets in the category of
strumous diseases, and it may be that in the fatal cases tuberculosis
of the mesenteric glands is a local expression of this diathesis.TREATMENT.--The treatment consists, for the most part, in methods of
prevention and palliation.The tendency to disease of the lymphatic
glands in scrofulous children is so constant that it is important to
remove all sources of irritation and to combat all influences likely to
hasten or promote the localization of the constitutional condition.All
chronic discharges and diseases of the skin and mucous membrane, the
continuance of which might produce glandular complications, should be
cured as speedily as possible, slight colds should receive prompt
attention, and catarrhal inflammations of the respiratory organs should
be arrested as quickly as the resources of science will permit.The
alimentary tract demands constant and careful observation.Trivial
disorders should not be neglected: the causes should be ascertained and
removed.Digestion and nutrition should be maintained at a healthy
standard.The hygiene of person, dwelling, and sleeping apartments
merits constant and intelligent supervision.As stated above, tabes of the mesenteric glands is so frequently
secondary to other diseases of a scrofulous nature that the danger lies
in the failure to arrest or cure such affections.It is unfortunately
too true that some of them are often beyond the resources of medical
skill, but in many cases the initial manifestations of the strumous
diathesis are either entirely neglected or inappropriately treated.In
many such cases the final and fatal complication of mesenteric phthisis
could be prevented.The treatment of these affections belongs properly
to the subjects of tuberculosis and scrofula, to be found in other
parts of this System of Medicine.Localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands is so often, either
{1194} directly or indirectly, connected with catarrhal inflammations
of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane that the cure of these
affections cannot be too strongly insisted upon as an effective method
of prevention.This is especially true with children exhibiting the
physical signs of the strumous diathesis.When it is inherited from a
diseased mother, it may be necessary to resort to artificial feeding
before the proper time for weaning has been reached.In such cases no
uniform rule can be arbitrarily followed.The condition of both mother
and child must be considered, and cases will occur which will demand
the exercise of the most cautious discretion and diligent observation.When the disease has become established but little can be accomplished.In such cases the treatment refers to the palliation of symptoms and
the maintenance of nutrition.Pain, when present, must be relieved--if
necessary by anodynes, either given internally or applied in the form
of cataplasms.Most often it is due to the coexisting disease of the
intestinal mucous membrane or to the ingestion of unsuitable foods.The
diet should be regulated and limited to nutritious and easily-digested
articles.Sometimes, even in cases of advanced degeneration of the
glands, great benefit may be temporarily obtained by attention to the
diet.Diarrhoea should be controlled, but when dependent upon
tuberculous ulcerations of the intestinal mucous membrane but little
can be done toward delaying the fatal termination.When a large number
of glands are affected, it will be necessary to limit the diet to such
nutrient fluids as may be absorbed from the stomach.The medical treatment is confined to a few remedies.Faulty nutrition
is the predominant factor, and the drugs employed should be directed to
the improvement of the assimilative functions.The lacto-phosphate of
iron in the form of syrup, or the phosphates in the form of the
compound syrup, sometimes prove valuable tonics.The lacto-phosphate
may be given in combination with cod-liver oil.This latter, either
internally or by inunction, is the most valuable and universally
applicable of all remedies.The mistake is very frequently made of
giving too large quantities.Few children can digest as much as a
drachm administered three times a day.In Washington it is usually
given in the form of the phosphatic emulsion, and has proved in the
service of the Children's Hospital a valuable and effective remedy in
the nutritional disorders of children.Of the chalybeates, the syrup of
the iodide of iron is by far the most valuable; this may be given alone
or in combination with cod-liver oil.It is specially indicated when
anaemia is a marked characteristic.Some recent reports favor the
employment of pancreatized foods.The ointment of the iodide of lead
has been highly extolled as a local application to the belly.The
nature of the disease should be constantly borne in mind, and all
depressing agencies should be sedulously avoided.{1195}
