and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

springing up."It's time we were getting ready for a homeward move," said Maggie."I'll
go and pack the things.""And I'll help you," added Miss Hargrove, hastily following her."Let me look at the house, too," said Amy, taking the glass; then added,
after a moment: "Poor Margaret Arnold!It was indeed a tragedy, as you
said, Webb--a sadder one than these old military preparations can
suggest.In all his career of war and treachery Arnold never inflicted a
more cruel wound.""How much feeling Miss Hargrove showed!""Yes," said Amy, quietly, "she was evidently feeling deeply."Her thought
was, "I don't believe she heard a word that Webb said."Then, seeing that
Burt was helping Maggie and Miss Hargrove, she added, "Please point out
to me some other interesting places."Webb, well pleased, talked on to a listener who did not give him her
whole attention.She could not forget Gertrude's paleness, and her
alternations from extreme gayety to a look of such deep sadness as to
awaken not a little sympathetic curiosity.Amy loved her friend truly,
and it did not seem strange to her that Miss Hargrove was deeply
interested in Burt, since they had been much thrown together, and since
she probably owed her life to him.Amy's resentment toward Burt had
passed away.She had found that her pride, merely, and not her heart, was
wounded by his new passion, and she already began to feel that she never
could have any such regard for him as her friend was possibly cherishing.Therefore it was, perhaps, not unnatural that her tranquil regard should
prove unsatisfying to Burt in contrast with the passion of which Miss
Hargrove was capable.She had seen his vain efforts to remain loyal, and
had smiled at them, proposing to let matters take their course, and to
give little aid in extricating him from his dilemma.But, if she had
interpreted her friend's face aright, she could no longer stand aloof, an
amused and slightly satirical spectator.If Burt deserved some
punishment, Gertrude did not, and she was inclined to guess the cause of
the latter's haste to return to the city.It may thus be seen that Amy was fast losing her unsophisticated
girlhood.While Burt's passionate words had awakened no corresponding
feeling, they had taught her that she was no longer a child, since she
could inspire such words.Her intimacy with Miss Hargrove, and the
latter's early confidences, had enlarged her ideas on some subjects.As
the bud of a flower passes slowly through long and apparently slow stages
of immaturity and at last suddenly opens to the light, so she had reached
that age when a little experience suggests a great deal, and the
influences around her tended to develop certain thoughts very rapidly.She saw that her friend had not been brought up in English seclusion.Admirers by the score had flocked around her, and, as she had often said,
she proposed to marry for love."I have the name of being cold," she once
told Amy, "but I know I can love as can few others, and I shall know it
well when I do love, too."The truth was daily growing clearer to Amy
that under our vivid American skies the grand passion is not a fiction of
romance or a quiet arrangement between the parties concerned.Miss Hargrove had not misjudged herself.Her tropical nature, when once
kindled, burned with no feeble, wavering flame.She had passed the point
of criticism of Burt.She loved him, and to her fond eyes he seemed more
worthy of her love than any man she had ever before known.But she had
not passed beyond her sense of truth and duty, and the feeling came to
her that she must go away at once and engage in that most pathetic of all
struggles that fall to woman's lot.As the conviction grew clear on this
bright October day, she felt that her heart was bleeding internally.Tears would come into her eyes at the dreary prospect.Her former
brilliant society life now looked as does an opera-house in the morning,
when the gilding and tinsel that flashed and sparkled the evening before
are seen to be dull and tarnished.Burt had appeared to especial
advantage in his mountain home.His
tall, fine figure and unconscious, easy manner were as full of grace as
deficient in conventionality, and she thought with disgust of many of her
former admirers, who were nothing if not stylish after the arbitrary mode
of the hour.At the same time he had proved that he could be at home in a
drawing-room on the simple ground of good-breeding, and not because he
had been run through fashion's latest mold.The grand scenery around her
suggested the manhood that kindled her imagination--a manhood strong,
fearless, and not degenerated from that sturdy age which had made these
scenes historic.By the time they were ready to start homeward the southern side of Cro'
Nest was in deep blue shadow.They bowled along rapidly till they came to
the steep ascent, and then the boys and the young men sprang out."Would
you like to walk, Gertrude?"Amy asked, for she was bent on throwing her
friend and Burt together during the witching twilight that was coming on
apace."I fear I am too tired, unless the load is heavy," she replied."Oh, no, indeed," said Webb."It does not take long to reach the top of
the mountain on this side, and then it's chiefly down hill the rest of
the way."Amy, who had been sitting with Webb and Johnnie as before, said to Miss
Hargrove, "Won't you step across the seats and keep me company?"She was so utterly unhappy that she
wished to be left to herself as far as possible.In her realization of a
loss that seemed immeasurable, she was a little resentful toward Amy,
feeling that she had been more frank and confidential than her friend.If
Amy had claims on Burt, why had she not spoken of them?why had she
permitted her for whom she professed such strong friendship to drift
almost wholly unwarned upon so sad a fate?and why was she now clearly
trying to bring together Burt and the one to whom even he felt that he
had no right to speak in more than a friendly manner?While she was
making such immense sacrifices to be true, she felt that Amy was
maintaining an unfair reticence, if not actually beguiling herself and
Burt into a display of weakness for which they would be condemned--or, at
least, he would be, and love identifies itself with its object.These
thoughts, having once been admitted, grew upon her mind rapidly, for it
is hard to suffer through another and maintain a gentle charity.Therefore she was silent when she took her seat by Amy, and when the
latter gave her a look that was like a caress, she did not return it."You are tired, Gertrude," Amy began gently.You
must stay with me to-night, and I'll watch over you like Sairy Gamp."So far from responding to Amy's playful and friendly words, Miss Hargrove
said, hastily,

"Oh, no, I had better go right on home.I don't feel very well, and shall
be better at home; and I must begin to get ready to-morrow for my return
to the city."Amy would not be repulsed, but, putting her arm around her friend, she
looked into her eyes, and asked:

"Why are you so eager to return to New York?Are you tiring of your
country friends?You certainly told me that you expected to stay till
November.""Fred must go back to school to-morrow," said Gertrude, in a constrained
voice, "and I do not think it is well to leave him alone in the city
house.""You are withdrawing your confidence from me," said Amy, sadly.If you had, I should not be the unhappy girl I am-to-night.Well,
since you wish to know the whole truth you shall.You said you could
trust me implicitly, and I promised to deserve your trust.If you had
said to me that Burt was bound to you when I told you that I was
heart-whole and fancy-free, I should have been on my guard.Is it natural
that I should be indifferent to the man who risked his life to save mine?Why have you left me so long in his society without a hint of warning?I shall not try to snatch happiness from
another."Johnnie's tuneful little voice was piping a song, and the rumble of the
wheels over a stony road prevented Maggie, on the last seat, from hearing
anything."Now you _shall_ stay with me
to-night," she said.See, Burt has
turned, and is coming toward us.I pledge you my word he can never be to
me more than a brother.I do not love him except as a brother, and never
have, and you can snatch no happiness from me, except by treating me with
distrust and going away.""Oh, Amy," began Miss Hargrove, in tones and with a look that gave
evidence of the chaotic bewilderment of her mind.We are not very lonely, thank you, Mr.You look, as far as I
can see you through the dusk, as if you were commiserating us as poor
forlorn creatures, but we have some resources within ourselves."We are the forlorn creatures who have
no resources.I assure you we are very simple,
honest people.""In that case I shall have no fears, but clamber in at once.I feel as if
I had been on a twenty-mile tramp.""What an implied compliment to our exhilarating society!""Indeed there is--a very strong one.I've been so immensely exhilarated
that, in the re-action, I'm almost faint.""Maggie," cried Amy, "do take care of Burt; he's going to faint.""He must wait till we come to the next brook, and then we'll put him in
it.""Webb," said Amy, looking over her shoulder at the young man, who was now
following the carriage, "is there anything the matter with you, also?""Oh, your trouble, whatever it may be, is chronic.Well, well, to think
that we poor women may be the only survivors of this tremendous
expedition.""That would be most natural--the survival of the fittest, you know."Science is uppermost in your mind, as
ever.You ought to live a thousand years, Webb, to see the end of all
your theories.""I fear it wouldn't be the millennium for me, and that I should have more
perplexing theories at its end than now.""That's the way with men--they are never satisfied," remarked Miss
Hargrove.Clifford, this is your expedition, and it's getting so
dark that I shall feel safer if you are driving.""Oh, Gertrude, you have no confidence in me whatever.As if I would break
your neck--or heart either!""You are a very mysterious little woman," was the reply, given in like
manner, "and need hours of explanation."Clifford,
I've much more confidence in you than in Amy.Her talk is so giddy that I
want a sober hand on the reins.""I want one to drive who can see his way, not feel it," was the laughing
response.Amy, too, was laughing silently, as she reined in the horses."What are you
two girls giggling about?""The
idea of two such refined creatures giggling!""Well," exclaimed Webb, "what am I to do?I can't stand up between you
and drive.""Gertrude, you must clamber around and sustain Burt's drooping spirits.""Indeed, Amy, you must know best how to do that," was the reply."As
guest, I claim a little of the society of the commander-in-chief."I'll solve the vexed question," said Burt, much nettled, and leaping
out."Now, Burt, the question isn't vexed, and don't you be," cried Amy,
springing lightly over to the next seat."There are Fred and Alf, too,
with the gun.Let us all get home as soon as possible, for it's nearly
time for supper already.Come, I shall feel much hurt if you don't keep
me company."Burt at once realized the absurdity of showing pique, although he felt
that there was something in the air which he did not understand.He came
back laughing, with much apparent good-nature, and saying, "I thought I'd
soon bring one or the other of you to terms."said Amy, with difficulty restraining a
new burst of merriment.They soon reached the summit, and paused to give the horses a breathing.The young moon hung in the west, and its silver crescent symbolized to
Miss Hargrove the hope that was growing in her heart."Amy," she said,
"don't you remember the song we arranged from 'The Culprit Fay'?We
certainly should sing it here on this mountain.Amy sang, in clear soprano:

  "'The moon looks down on old Cro' Nest,
  She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast,
  And seems his huge gray form to throw
  In a silver cone on the wave below.'""Imagine the cone and wave, please," said Miss Hargrove; and then, in an
alto rich with her heart's deep feeling, she sang with Amy:

  "'Ouphe and goblin!Ye that love the moon's soft light,
    Hither--hither wend your way;
    Twine ye in a jocund ring;
    Sing and trip it merrily,
    Hand to hand and wing to wing,
    Round the wild witch-hazel tree.'""If I were a goblin, I'd come, for music like that," cried Burt, as they
started rapidly homeward."You are much too big to suggest a culprit fay," said Amy."But the description of the fay's charmer is your portrait," he replied,
in a low tone:

  "'But well I know her sinless mind
    Is pure as the angel forms above,
    Gentle and meek, and chaste and kind,
    Such as a spirit well might love.'""Oh, no; you are mistaken, I'm not meek in the least.Think of the
punishment:

  "'Tied to the hornet's shardy wings,
    Toss'd on the pricks of nettles' stings;'

you know the rest.""What witchery has got into you to-night, Amy?""That last song was so good that I, for one, would be glad of more," cried
Webb."You men must help us, then," said Miss Hargrove, and in a moment the wild,
dim forest was full of melody, the rocks and highlands sending back soft
and unheeded echoes.Burt, meantime, was occupied with disagreeable reflections.Perhaps both
the girls at last understood him, and had been comparing notes, to his
infinite disadvantage.His fickleness and the dilemma he was in may have
become a jest between them.Resentment, except against
himself, was impossible.If Amy understood him, in what other way could
she meet any approach to sentiment on his part than by a laughing scorn?If Miss Hargrove had divined the past, or had received a hint concerning
it, why should she not shun his society?He was half-desperate, and yet
felt that any show of embarrassment or anger would only make him appear
more ridiculous.The longer he thought the more sure he was that the
girls were beginning to guess his position, and that his only course was
a polite indifference to both.But this policy promised to lead through a
thorny path, and to what?In impotent rage at himself he ground his teeth
during the pauses between the stanzas that he was compelled to sing.Such
was the discord in his heart that he felt like uttering notes that would
make "night hideous."He was still more distraught when, on their return, they found Mr.Hargrove's carriage in waiting, and Amy, after a brief conference with
her friend in her room, came down prepared to accompany Miss Hargrove
home after supper.In spite of all his efforts at ease and gayety, his
embarrassment and trouble were evident.He had observed Miss Hargrove's
pallor and her effort to keep up at Fort Putnam, and could not banish the
hope that she sympathized with him; but now the young girl was demurely
radiant.Her color had come again, and the lustre of her beautiful eyes
was dazzling.Yet they avoided his, and she had far more to say to Webb
and the others than to him.Webb, too, was perplexed, for during the day
Amy had been as bewildering to him as to Burt.But he was in no
uncertainty as to his course, which was simply to wait.He, with Burt,
saw the girls to the carriage, and the latter said good-night rather
coldly and stiffly.Alf and Fred parted regretfully, with the promise of
a correspondence which would be as remarkable for its orthography as for
its natural history.CHAPTER LII

BURT'S SORE DILEMMA


Mr.Hargrove greeted Amy cordially, but his questioning eyes rested
oftenest on his daughter.Her expression and manner caused him to pace
his study long and late that night.Hargrove was very polite and a
little stately.She felt that she existed on a plane above Amy.The young girls soon pleaded fatigue, and retired.Once in the seclusion
of their room they forgot all about their innocent fib, and there was not
a trace of weariness in their manner.While Burt was staring at his
dismal, tangled fortune, seeing no solution of his difficulties, a
fateful conference relating to him was taking place.Amy did not look
like a scorner, as with a sister's love and a woman's tact she pleaded
his cause and palliated his course to one incapable of harsh judgment.But she felt that she must be honest with her friend, and that the whole
truth would be best and safest.Her conclusion was: "No man who loved
_you_, and whom you encouraged, would ever change.I know now that I
never had a particle of such feeling as you have for Burt, and can see
that I naturally chilled and quenched his regard for me."Miss Hargrove's dark eyes flashed ominously as she spoke of Burt or of
any man proving faithless after she had given encouragement."But it wasn't possible for me to give him any real encouragement," Amy
persisted."I've never felt as you do, and am not sure that I want to for
a long time."Miss Hargrove almost said, but she suppressed the
words, feeling that since he had not revealed his secret she had no right
to do so.Indeed, as she recalled how sedulously he had guarded it she
was sure he would not thank her for suggesting it to Amy before she was
ready for the knowledge.Impetuous as Miss Hargrove was at times, she had
too fine a nature to be careless of the rights and feelings of others.Moreover, she felt that Webb had been her ally, whether consciously or
not, and he should have his chance with all the help she could give him,
but she was wise enough to know that obtrusion and premature aid are
often disastrous.The decision, after this portentous conference, was: "Mr.Bart must seek
me, and seek very zealously.I know you well enough Amy, to be sure that
you will give him no hints.It's bad enough to love a man before I've
been asked to do so.What an utterly perverse and unmanageable thing
one's heart is!I shall do no angling, however, nor shall I permit any.""You may stand up straight, Gertrude," said Amy, laughing, "but don't
lean over backward."Burt entertained half a dozen wild and half-tragic projects before he
fell asleep late that night, but finally, in utter self-disgust, settled
down on the prosaic and not irrational one of helping through with the
fall work on the farm, and then of seeking some business or profession to
which he could give his whole mind."As to ladies' society," he
concluded, savagely, "I'll shun it hereafter till I'm grown up."Burt always attained a certain kind of peace and the power to sleep after
he had reached an irrevocable decision.During the night the wind veered to the east, and a cold, dismal
rain-storm set in.Dull and dreary indeed the day proved to Burt.He
could not go out and put his resolution into force.He fumed about the
house, restless, yet reticent.He would rather have fought dragons than
keep company with his own thoughts in inaction.All the family supposed
he missed Amy, except Webb, who hoped he missed some one else."Why don't you go over and bring Amy home, Burt?"his mother asked, at
the dinner-table."The house seems empty without her, and everybody is
moping.Even father has fretted over his newspaper, and wished Amy was
here.""Why can't they print an edition of the paper for old men and dark days?""Well," remarked Leonard, leaning back in his chair, and looking
humorously at Maggie, "I'm sorry for you young fellows, but I'm finding
the day serene.""Of course you are," snapped Burt."With an armchair to doze in and a
dinner to look forward to, what more do you wish?As for Webb, he can
always get astride of some scientific hobby, no matter how bad the
weather is.""As for Burt, he can bring Amy home, and then every one will be
satisfied," added his mother, smiling.Thus a new phase of his trial presented itself to poor Burt.He must
either face those two girls after their night's conclave, with all its
possible revelations, or else awaken at once very embarrassing surmises.And in a mood of mingled
recklessness and fear he drove through the storm.When his name was
announced the girls smiled significantly, but went down looking as
unconscious as if they had not spoken of him in six months, and Burt
could not have been more suave, non-committal, and impartially polite if
these ladies had been as remote from his thoughts as one of Webb's
theories.At the same time he intimated that he would be ready to return
when Amy was.At parting the friends gave each other a little look of dismay, and he
caught it from the same telltale mirror that persisted in taking a part
in this drama.though the young fellow, "so they have been exchanging confidences,
and my manner is disconcerting--not what was expected.If I have become a
jest between them it shall be a short-lived one.Miss Hargrove, with all
her city experience, shall find that I'm not so young and verdant but that
I can take a hand in this game also.As for Amy, I now know she never cared
for me, and I don't believe she ever would;" and so he went away with
laughing repartee, and did not see the look of deep disappointment with
which he was followed.Her innocent schemes might not be so
easily accomplished if Burt would be wrong-headed.She was aware of the
dash of recklessness in his character, and feared that under the impulse
of pride he might spoil everything, or, at least, cause much needless
delay.With the fatality of blundering which usually attends upon such
occasions, he did threaten to fulfil her fears, and so successfully that
Amy was in anxiety, and Miss Hargrove grew as pale as she was resolute
not to make the least advance, while poor Webb felt that his suspense
never would end.Burt treated Amy in an easy, fraternal manner.He
engaged actively in the task of gathering and preparing for market the
large crop of apples, and he openly broached the subject of going into a
business of some kind away from home, where, he declared, with a special
meaning for Amy, he was not needed, adding: "It's time I was earning my
salt and settling down to something for life.Webb and Len can take care
of all the land, and I don't believe I was cut out for a farmer."He not only troubled Amy exceedingly, but he perplexed all the family,
for it seemed that he was decidedly taking a new departure.One evening,
a day or two after he had introduced the project of going elsewhere, his
father, to Amy's dismay, suggested that he should go to the far West and
look after a large tract of land which the old gentleman had bought some
years before.It was said that a railroad was to be built through it,
and, if so, the value of the property would be greatly enhanced, and
steps should be taken to get part of it into the market.Burt took hold
of the scheme with eagerness, and was for going as soon as possible.Looking to note the effect of his words upon Amy, he saw that her
expression was not only reproachful, but almost severe.Leonard heartily
approved of the plan.Webb was silent, and in deep despondency, feeling
that if Bart went now nothing would be settled.He saw Amy's aversion to
the project also, and misinterpreted it.She was compelled to admit that the prospects were growing very dark.Burt might soon depart for an indefinite absence, and Miss Hargrove
return to the city.Amy, who had looked upon the mutations in her own
prospects so quietly, was almost feverishly eager to aid her friend.She
feared she had blundered on the mountain ride.Burt's pride had been
wounded, and he had received the impression that his April-like moods had
been discussed satirically.It was certain that he had been very deeply
interested in Gertrude, and that he was throwing away not only his
happiness, but also hers; and Amy felt herself in some degree to blame.Therefore she was bent upon ending the senseless misunderstanding, but
found insurmountable embarrassments on every side.Miss Hargrove was
prouder than Burt.Wild horses could not draw her to the Cliffords', With
a pale, resolute face, she declined even to put herself in the way of
receiving the least advance.Amy would gladly have taken counsel of Webb,
but could not do so without revealing her friend's secret, and also
disclosing mere surmises about Burt, which, although amounting to
conviction in her mind, could not be mentioned.Therefore, from the very
delicacy of the situation, she felt herself helpless.Nature was her
ally, however, and if all that was passing in Burt's mind had been
manifest, the ardent little schemer would not have been so despondent.The best hope of Burt had been that he had checkmated the girls in their
disposition to make jesting comparisons, He would retire with so much
nonchalance as to leave nothing to be said.They would find complete
inaction and silence hard to combat.But the more he thought of it the
less it seemed like an honorable retreat.He had openly wooed one girl,
he had since lost his heart to another, and she had given him a glimpse
of strong regard, if not more.His thoughts were busy with her every word
and glance.How much had his tones and eyes revealed to her?Might she
not think him a heartless flirt if he continued to avoid her and went
away without a word?Would it not be better to be laughed at as one who
did not know his own mind than be despised for deliberate trifling?Amy
had asked him to go and spend an evening with her friend, and he had
pleaded weariness as an excuse.Her incredulous look and rather cool
manner since had not been reassuring.She had that very morning broached
the subject of a chestnutting party for the following day, and he had
promptly said that he was going to the city to make inquiries about
routes to the West."Why, Burt, you can put off your trip to town for a day," said his
mother."If you are to leave us so soon you should make the most of the
days that are left.""That is just what he is doing," Amy remarked, satirically."He has
become absorbed in large business considerations.Those of us who have
not such resources are of no consequence."The old people and Leonard believed that Amy was not pleased with the
idea of Burt's going away, but they felt that she was a little
unreasonable, since the young fellow was rather to be commended for
wishing to take life more seriously.But her words rankled in Burt's
mind.He felt that she understood him better than the others, and that he
was not winning respect from her.In the afternoon he saw her, with Alf
and Johnnie, starting for the chestnut-trees, and although she passed not
far away she gave him only a slight greeting, and did not stop for a
little merry banter, as usual.The young fellow was becoming very
unhappy, and he felt that his position was growing intolerable.That Amy
should be cold toward him, or, indeed, toward any one, was an unheard-of
thing, and he knew that she must feel that there was good reason for her
manner."What are she and
Miss Hargrove thinking about me?"The more he thought upon the past the more awkward and serious appeared
his dilemma, and his long Western journey, which at first he had welcomed
as promising a diversion of excitement and change, now began to appear
like exile.He dreaded to think of the memories he must take with him;
still more he deprecated the thoughts he would leave behind him.His
plight made him so desperate that he suddenly left the orchard where he
was gathering apples, went to the house, put on his riding-suit, and in a
few moments was galloping furiously away on his black horse.With a
renewal of hope Webb watched his proceedings, and with many surmises,
Amy, from a distant hillside, saw him passing at a break-neck pace.CHAPTER LIII

BURT'S RESOLVE


For the first two or three miles Burt rode as if he were trying to leave
care behind him, scarcely heeding what direction he took.When at last he
reined his reeking horse he found himself near the entrance of the lane
over which willows met in a Gothic arch.He yielded to the impulse to visit
the spot which had seen the beginning of so fateful an acquaintance, and
had not gone far when a turn in the road revealed a group whose presence
almost made his heart stand still for a moment.Miss Hargrove had stopped
her horse on the very spot where he had aided her in her awkward
predicament.Her back was toward him, and her great dog was at her side,
looking up into her face, as if in mute sympathy with his fair mistress.She could not be there with bowed head if
she despised him.Her presence seemed in harmony with that glance by
which, when weak and unnerved after escaping from deadly peril, she had
revealed possibly more than gratitude to the one who had rescued her.His
love rose like an irresistible tide, and he resolved that before he left
his home Amy and Miss Hargrove should know the whole truth, whatever
might be the result.Meanwhile he was rapidly approaching the young girl,
and the dog's short bark of recognition was her first intimation of
Hurt's presence.Her impulse was to fly, but in a second she saw the
absurdity of this course, and yet she was greatly embarrassed, and would
rather have been discovered by him at almost any other point of the
globe.She was going to the city on the morrow, and as she had drawn rein
on this spot and realized the bitterness of her disappointment, tears
would come.She wiped them hastily away, but dreaded lest their traces
should be seen.Turning her horse, she met Burt with a smile that her moist eyes belied,
and said: "I'm glad you do not find me in such an awkward plight as when
we first met here.and away like the wind she started homeward.Burt easily kept at her side, but conversation was impossible.At last he
said: "My horse is very tired, Miss Hargrove.At this pace you will soon
be home, and I shall feel that you are seeking to escape from me.Have I
fallen so very low in your estimation?""Why," she exclaimed, in well-feigned surprise, as she checked her horse,
"what have you done that you should fall in my estimation?""I shall tell you before very long," he said, with an expression that
seemed almost tragic.Surely
this brief gallop cannot have so tried your superb beast."Oh, no," he replied, with a grim laugh.I had been riding rapidly before I met you.My horse has been
idle for some days, and I had to run the spirit out of him.Amy wishes to
have a chestnutting party to-morrow.Clifford, but I return to the city tomorrow afternoon,
and was coming over in the morning to say good-by to Amy and your father
and mother.""I am very sorry too," he said, in tones that gave emphasis to his words.She turned upon him a swift, questioning glance, but her eyes instantly
fell before his intense gaze."Oh, well," she said, lightly, "we've had a very pleasant summer, and all
things must come to an end, you know."Then she went on speaking, in a
matter-of-fact way, of the need of looking after Fred, who was alone in
town, and of getting the city house in order, and of her plans for the
winter, adding: "As there is a great deal of fruit on the place, papa
does not feel that he can leave just yet.You know he goes back and forth
often, and so his business does not suffer.But I can just as well go
down now, and nearly all my friends have returned to town.""All your friends, Miss Hargrove?""Amy has promised to visit me soon," she said, hastily."It would seem that I am not down on your list of friends," he began,
gloomily.Clifford, I'm sure papa and I would be glad to have you call
whenever you are in town.""I fear I shall have to disappoint Mr.Hargrove," he said, a little
satirically."I'm going West the last of this month, and may be absent
much of the winter.I expect to look about in that section for some
opening in business.""Indeed," she replied, in tones which were meant to convey but little
interest, yet which had a slight tremor in spite of her efforts."It will
be a very great change for you.""Perhaps you think that constitutes its chief charm."Clifford," she said, "what chance have I had to think about it at
all?(Amy had, however, and
Gertrude had not only thought about it, but dreamed of it, as if she had
been informed that on a certain date the world would end.)"Is it not a
rather sudden plan?"My father has a large tract of land in the West, and it's
time it was looked after.Isn't it natural that I should think of doing
something in life?I fear there is an impression in your mind that I
entertain few thoughts beyond having a good time.""To have a good time in life," she said, smiling at him, "is a very
serious matter, worthy of any one's attention.It would seem that few
accomplish it.""And I greatly fear that I shall share in the ill-success of the
majority."You will soon be
enjoying the excitement of travel and enterprise in the West.""And you the excitement of society and conquest in the city.Conquests,
however, must be almost wearisome to you, Miss Hargrove, you make them so
easily."I certainly should soon weary of conquests were I
making them.Where in
history do we read of a man who was satiated with conquest?"Are you going to the city to-morrow?""Will you forgive me if I come alone?"I suppose Amy will be tired from nutting."He did not reply, but lifted his hat gravely, mounted his horse, and
galloped away as if he were an aid bearing a message that might avert a
battle.Miss Hargrove hastened to her room, and took off her hat with trembling
hands.Burt's pale, resolute face told her that the crisis in her life
had come.If he meant to speak,
why had he not done so?why had he not asked permission to consult her
father?Hargrove, from his library window, saw Burt's formal parting, and
concluded that his fears or hopes--he scarcely knew which were uppermost,
so deep was his love for his daughter, and so painful would it be to see
her unhappy--were not to be fulfilled.By a great effort Gertrude
appeared not very _distraite_ at dinner, nor did she mention Burt,
except in a casual manner, in reply to a question from her mother, but
her father thought he detected a strong and suppressed excitement.She excused herself early from the table, and said she must finish
packing for her departure.CHAPTER LIV

A GENTLE EXORCIST


Burt's black horse was again white before he approached his home.In the
distance he saw Amy returning, the children running on before, Alf
whooping like a small Indian to some playmate who was answering further
away.The gorgeous sunset lighted up the still more brilliant foliage,
and made the scene a fairyland.But Burt had then no more eye for nature
than a man would have who had staked his all on the next throw of the
dice.Amy was alone, and now was his chance to intercept her before she
reached the house.Imagine her surprise as she saw him make his horse
leap the intervening fences, and come galloping toward her."Burt," she cried, as he, in a moment or two, reined up near her, "you
will break your neck!""It wouldn't matter much," he said, grimly."I fear a worse fate than
that."He threw the bridle over a stake in the fence, and the horse was glad to
rest, with drooping head.Then he came and stood beside her, his face
flushed, and his mouth twitching with excitement and strong feeling."Burt," she said, "what is the matter?"I fear your scorn, Amy," he began, impetuously; "I fear I shall lose
your respect forever.But I can't go on any longer detesting myself and
feeling that you and Miss Hargrove despise me.I may seem to you and her
a fickle fool, a man of straw, but you shall both know the truth.I
shan't go away a coward.I can at least be honest, and then you may think
what you please of my weakness and vacillation.You cannot think worse
things than I think myself, but you must not imagine that I am a
cold-blooded, deliberate trifler, for that has never been true.I know
you don't care for me, and never did.""Indeed, Burt, you are mistaken.I do care for you immensely," said Amy,
eagerly clasping his arm with both her hands."Amy, Amy," said Burt, in a low, desperate tone, "think how few short
months have passed since I told you I loved you, and protested I would
wait till I was gray.You have seen me giving my thoughts to another, and
in your mind you expect to see me carried away by a half-dozen more.You
are mistaken, but it will take a long time to prove it.""No, Burt, I understand you better than you think.Gertrude has inspired
in you a very different feeling from the one you had for me.I think you
are loving now with a man's love, and won't get over it very soon, if you
ever do.You have seen, you must have felt, that my love for you was only
that of a sister, and of course you soon began to feel toward me in the
same way.I don't believe I would have married you had you waited an age.Don't fret, I'm not going to break my heart about you.""I should think not, nor will any one else.Oh, Amy, I so despised myself
that I have been half-desperate.""Despised yourself because you love a girl like Gertrude Hargrove!I
never knew a man to do a more natural and sensible thing, whether she
gave you encouragement or not.If I were a man I would make love to her,
rest assured, and she would have to refuse me more than once to be rid of
me."Burt took a long breath of immense relief."You are heavenly kind," he
said."Are you sure you won't despise me?It seems
to me that I have done such an awfully mean thing in making love to you
in my own home, and then in changing.""Fate has been too strong for you, and I
think--I mean--I hope, it has been kind.Bless you, Burt, I could never
get up any such feeling as sways you.I should always be disappointing,
and you would have found out, sooner or later, that your best chance
would be to discover some one more responsive.Since you have been so
frank, I'll be so too.I was scarcely more ready for your words last
spring than Johnnie, but I was simple enough to think that in half a
dozen years or so we might be married if all thought it was best, and my
pride was a little hurt when I saw what--what--well, Gertrude's influence
over you.But I've grown much older the last few months, and know now
that my thoughts were those of a child.My feeling for you is simply that
of a sister, and I don't believe it would ever have changed.I
might eventually have an acute attack also, and then I should be in a
worse predicament than yours.""But you will be my loving sister as long as you live, Amy?You will
believe that I have a little manhood if given a chance to show it?""I believe it now, Burt, and I can make you a hundredfold better sister
than wife.It seems but the other day I was playing with dolls.You have judged yourself too harshly;" and she
looked at him so smilingly and affectionately that he took her in his
arms and kissed her again and again, exclaiming, "You can count on one
brother to the last drop of his blood.Oh, Amy, whatever happens now, I
won't lose courage.Miss Hargrove will have to say no a dozen times
before she is through with me."At this moment Webb, from the top of a tall ladder in the orchard,
happened to glance that way, and saw the embrace.He instantly descended,
threw down his basket of apples, and with it all hope.The coolness between them had been but a misunderstanding, which
apparently had been banished most decidedly.He mechanically took down
his ladder and placed it on the ground, then went to his room to prepare
for supper."Burt," cried Amy, when they were half-way home, "you have forgotten your
horse.""If he were Pegasus, I should have forgotten him to-day."Oh, yes, I'll do anything for you.""Will you tell me if you think Miss
Hargrove--"

"No, I won't tell you anything.After she has refused you half
a dozen times, I may, out of pity, intercede a little.Go get your horse,
smooth your brow, and be sensible, or you'll have Webb and Leonard poking
fun at you.Suppose they have seen you galloping over fences and ditches
like one possessed.""Well, I was possessed, and never was there such a kind, gentle exorcist.I have seen Miss Hargrove to-day; I had just parted from her."How could I, until I had told you?I felt I was bound to you by
all that can bind a man.""Oh, Burt, suppose I had not released you, but played Shylock, what would
you have done?"and her laugh rang out again in intense merriment."I had no fears of that," he replied, ruefully."You are the last one to
practice Mrs.My fear was that you and Miss
Hargrove both would send me West as a precious good riddance.""Well, it was square of you, as Alf says, to come to me first, and I
appreciate it, but I should not have resented the omission.Will you
forgive my curiosity if I ask what is the next move in the campaign?I've
been reading about the war, you know, and I am quite military in my
ideas.""I have Miss Hargrove's permission to call to-night.It wasn't given very
cordially, and she asked me to bring you.""Oh, I told her she would have to forgive me if I came alone.I meant to
have it out to-day, if old Chaos came again."When Amy's renewed laughter
so subsided that he could speak, he resumed: "I'm going over there after
supper, to ask her father for permission to pay my addresses, and if he
won't give it, I shall tell him I will pay them all the same--that I
shall use every effort in my power to win his daughter.I don't want a
dollar of his money, but I'm bound to have the girl if she'll ever listen
to me after knowing all you know."Amy's laugh ceased, and she again clasped her hands on his arm."Dear
Burt," she said, "your course now seems to me manly and straightforward.I saw the strait you were in, but did not think you felt it so keenly.In
going West I feared you were about to run away from it.However Gertrude
may treat you, you have won my respect by your downright truth.She may
do as she pleases, but she can't despise you now.He has learned this afternoon that you are in no state of
mind to take care of him."CHAPTER LV

BURT TELLS HIS LOVE AGAIN


Webb appeared at the supper-table the personification of quiet geniality,
but Amy thought she had never seen him look so hollow-eyed.The long
strain was beginning to tell on him, decidedly, and to-night he felt as
if he had received a mortal blow.But with indomitable courage he hid his
wound, and seemed absorbed in a conversation with Leonard and his father
about the different varieties of apples, and their relative value.Amy
saw that his mother was looking at him anxiously, and she did not wonder.He was growing thin even to gauntness.Burt also was an arrant dissembler, and on rising from the table remarked
casually that he was going over to bid Miss Hargrove good-by, as she
would return to town on the morrow."She'll surely come and see us before she goes," Mrs."It seems to me she hasn't been very sociable of late."She told me she
was coming to say good-by to us all, and she has asked me to visit her.Come, Webb, you look all tired out to-night.I'll
stumble through the dryest scientific treatise you have if I can see you
resting on the sofa.""That's ever so kind of you, Amy, and I appreciate it more than you
imagine, but I'm going out this evening.""Oh, of course, sisters are of no account.What girl are _you_ going
to see?"I am too old and dull to entertain the pretty
creatures."You know one you could entertain if she isn't a pretty
creature, but then she's only a sister who doesn't know much.""I'm sorry--I must go," he said, a little abruptly, for her lovely,
half-laughing, half-reproachful face, turned to his, contained such
mocking promise of happiness that he could not look upon it.His rapid steps as he walked mile after mile indicated
that the matter was pressing indeed; but, although it was late before he
returned, he had spoken to no one.The house was dark and silent except
that a light was burning in Burt's room.And his momentous fortunes the
reader must now follow.Miss Hargrove, with a fluttering heart, heard the rapid feet of his horse
as he rode up the avenue.Truly, he was coming at a lover's pace.The
door-bell rang, she heard him admitted, and expected the maid's tap at
her door to follow.Were the tumultuous throbs of
her heart so loud that she could not hear it?She opened her door slightly; there was no
sound.There below, like a shadow, stood a
saddled horse.Had the stupid girl shown him into
the drawing-room and left him there?Surely the well-trained servant had
never been guilty of such a blunder before.Could it have been some one
else who had come to see her father on business?She stole down the
stairway in a tremor of apprehension, and strolled into the parlor in the
most nonchalant manner imaginable.It was lighted, but empty, and her
expression suddenly became one of troubled perplexity.She returned to
the hall, and started as if she had seen an apparition.There on the rack
hung Burt's hat, as natural as life.Voices reached her ear from her
father's study.She took a few swift steps toward it, then fled to her
room, and stood panting before her mirror, which reflected a young lady
in a costume charmingly ill adapted to "packing.""It was honorable in
him to speak to papa first, and papa would not, could not, answer him
without consulting me.I cannot be treated as a child any longer," she
muttered, with flashing eyes."Papa loves me," she murmured, in swift
alternation of gentle feeling."He could not make my happiness secondary
to a paltry sum of money."Hargrove had greeted him with
no little surprise.The parting of the young people had not promised any
such interview."Have you spoken to my daughter on this subject?"Hargrove asked,
gravely, after the young fellow had rather incoherently made known his
errand."No, sir," replied Burt, "I have not secured your permission.At the same
time," he added, with an ominous flash in his blue eyes, "sincerity
compels me to say that I could not take a final refusal from any lips
except those of your daughter, and not readily from hers.I would not
give up effort to win her until convinced that any amount of patient
endeavor was useless.I should not persecute her, but I would ask her to
reconsider an adverse answer as often as she would permit, and I will try
with all my soul to render myself more worthy of her."Hargrove, severely, "if I should decline this
honor, I should count for nothing.""No, sir, I do not mean that, and I hope I haven't said it, even by
implication.Your consent that I should have a fair field in which to do
my best would receive from me boundless gratitude.What I mean to say is,
that I could not give her up; I should not think it right to do so.This
question is vital to me, and I know of no reason," he added, a little
haughtily, "why I should be refused a privilege which is considered the
right of every gentleman.""I have not in the slightest degree raised the question of your being a
gentleman, Mr.Your course in coming to me before revealing
your regard to my daughter proves that you are one.But you should
realize that you are asking a great deal of me.My child's happiness is
my first and only consideration.You know the condition of life to which
my daughter has been accustomed.It is right and natural that I should
also know something of your prospects, your ability to meet the
obligations into which you wish to enter."After a moment he answered,
with a dignity and an evident sincerity which won golden opinions from
Mr.Hargrove: "I shall not try to mislead you in the least on this point.For my own sake I wish that your daughter were far poorer than I am.I
can say little more than that I could give her a home now and every
comfort of life.I could not now provide for her the luxury to which she
has been accustomed.But I am willing to wait and eager to work.In youth
and health and a fair degree of education I have some capital in addition
to the start in life which my father has promised to his sons.What could
not Miss Hargrove inspire a man to do?"The man of experience smiled in spite of himself at Burt's frank
enthusiasm and naivete.The whole affair was so different from anything
that he had ever looked forward to!Instead of a few formalities between
himself and a wealthy suitor whom his wife, and therefore all the world,
would approve of, here he was listening to a farmer's son, with the
consciousness that he must yield, and not wholly unwilling to do so.Moreover, this preposterous young man, so far from showing any awe of
him, had almost defied him from the start, and had plainly stated that
the father's wealth was the only objection to the daughter.Having seen
the drift of events, Mr.Hargrove had long since informed himself
thoroughly about the Clifford family, and had been made to feel that the
one fact of his wealth, which Burt regretted, was almost his only claim
to superiority.Burt was as transparent as a mountain brook, and quite as
impetuous.The gray-haired man sighed, and felt that he would give all
his wealth in exchange for such youth.He knew his daughter's heart, and
felt that further parleying was vain, although he foresaw no easy task in
reconciling his wife to the match.He was far from being heartbroken
himself, however, for there was such a touch of nature in Burt, and in
the full, strong love waiting to reward the youth, that his own heart was
stirred, and in the depths of his soul he knew that this was better than
giving his child to a jaded millionaire."I have money enough for both,"
he thought."As she said, she is rich enough to follow her heart.It's a
pity if we can't afford an old-fashioned love-match."Hargrove's deep thought and
silence.At last the father arose and gave him his hand, saying: "You have been
honest with me, and that, with an old merchant, counts for a great deal.I also perceive you love my daughter for herself.If she should ever
inform me that you are essential to her happiness I shall not withhold my
consent."Burt seized his hand with a grasp that made it ache, as he said, "Every
power I have, sir, shall be exerted that you may never regret this
kindness.""If you make good that promise, Mr.Clifford, I shall become your friend
should your wooing prove successful.If you will come to the parlor I
will tell Miss Hargrove that you are here."He went up the stairs slowly, feeling that he was crossing the threshold
of a great change.How many thoughts passed through his mind as he took
those few steps!He saw his child a little black-eyed baby in his arms;
she was running before him trundling her hoop; she came to him with
contracted brow and half-tearful eyes, bringing a knotty sum in
fractions, and insisting petulantly that they were very "vulgar" indeed;
she hung on his arm, a shy girl of fifteen, blushingly conscious of the
admiring eyes that followed her; she stood before him again in her first
radiant beauty as a _debutante_, and he had dreamed of the proudest
alliance that the city could offer; she looked into his eyes, a pale,
earnest woman, and said, "Papa, he saved my life at the risk of his own."Clifford had not spoken of that, and Mr.Hargrove had not
thought of it in the interview so crowded with considerations.His heart
relented toward the youth as it had not done before.Well, well, since it
was inevitable, he was glad to be the one who should first bring the
tidings of this bold wooer's purpose."Trurie will never forget this
moment," he mattered, as he knocked at her door, "nor my part in her
little drama."O love, how it craves even the crumbs that fall from the
table of its idol!"Trurie," he began, as he entered, "you had better dress.Bless me, I
thought you were packing!"Clifford said he would call--to bid me good-by, I suppose.""Was that all you supposed, Trurie?""Indeed, papa, I told him I was going to town to-morrow, and he asked if
he might call."I'm sure it's quite natural he should call, and I have been
packing.""Well, I can assure you that he has a very definite object.He has asked
me if he might pay his addresses to you, and in the same breath assured
me that he would in any event.""Oh, papa," she said, hiding her face on his shoulder, "he was not so
unmannerly as that!""Indeed, he went much further, declaring that he would take no refusal
from you, either; or, rather, that he would take it so often as to wear
out your patience, and secure you by proving that resistance was useless.He had one decided fault to find with you, also."Oh, papa, tell me what he did say;" and he felt her heart fluttering
against his side like that of a frightened bird."Why, Trurie, men have offered you love before.""But I never loved before, nor knew what it meant," she whispered.This is all so strange, so sacred to
me.""Well, Trurie, I hope your match may be one of those that are made in
heaven.Your mother will think it anything but worldly wise.However, I
will reconcile her to it, and I'm glad to be the one with whom you will
associate this day.Long after I am gone it may remind you how dear your
happiness was to me, and that I was willing to give up my way for yours.Clifford has been straightforward and manly, if not conventional, and
I've told him that if he could win you and would keep his promise to do
his best for you and by you, I would be his friend, and that, you know,
means much.Of course, it all depends upon whether you accept him.Here is an organ"--with her hand upon her heart--"that
knows better."Oh, no, I can excuse you," he said, with smiling lips but moist eyes."Dear papa, I will, indeed, associate you with this hour and every
pleasant thing in life.You will find that you have won me anew instead
of losing me;" and looking back at him with her old filial love shining
in her eyes, she went slowly away to meet the future under the sweet
constraint of Nature's highest law.If Burt had been impatient in the library, he grew almost desperate in
the parlor.Might not Miss
Hargrove's pride rise in arms against him?Might she not even now be
telling her father of his fickleness, and declaring that she would not
listen to a "twice-told tale"?Every moment of delay seemed ominous, and
many moments passed.The house grew sepulchral in its silence, and the
wind without sighed and moaned as if Nature foreboded and pitied him in
view of the overwhelming misfortune impending.At last he sprang up and
paced the room in his deep perturbation.As he turned toward the entrance
he saw framed in the doorway a picture that appeared like a radiant
vision.Miss Hargrove stood there, looking at him so intently that, for a
second or two, he stood spell-bound.She was dressed in some white,
clinging material, and, with her brilliant eyes, appeared in the
uncertain light too beautiful and wraith-like to be human.She saw her
advantage, and took the initiative instantly.Clifford," she
exclaimed, "do I seem an apparition?""Yes, you do," he replied, coming impetuously toward her.She held out
her hand, proposing that their interview should at least begin at arm's
length.Nevertheless, the soft fire in his eyes and the flush on his
handsome face made her tremble with a delicious apprehension.Even while
at a loss to know just how to manage the preliminaries for a decorous
yielding, she exulted over the flame-like spirit of her lover.Clifford," she cried, "you ought to know that you are not
crushing a ghost's hand."What I meant was that I thought I had seen you before, but
you are a new revelation every time I see you.""Please don't say that, for I must ask you to interpret one to-night.What does Shakespeare say about those who have power?I hope you will use
yours mercifully.Oh, Miss Hargrove, you are so beautiful that I believe
I should lose my reason if you sent me away without hope."Clifford, you are talking wildly," was her faint response.I am almost desperate from fear, for I have a terribly hard
duty to perform."she said, withdrawing her hand, which he relinquished most
reluctantly, dreading that he might never receive it again."Do not assume that attitude, Miss Hargrove, or I shall lose courage
utterly."Clifford," she said, a little satirically, seating herself on
a sofa, "I never imagined you deficient in courage.Is it a terrible duty
to entertain me for a half-hour, and say good-by?"Nothing could be worse than that, if that were all;" and he looked
at her appealingly and in such perplexed distress that she laughed
outright."I am very much in earnest, Miss Hargrove.""You are very enigmatical, Mr.Must I be present while you
perform this terrible duty?""I think you know what I must confess already, and have a world of scorn
in store for me.Whatever the end may be, and my
sense of ill-desert is heavy indeed, I shall begin on the basis of
absolute truth.I've asked your father for the
privilege of winning your love;" and then he hesitated, not knowing how
to go on."No, I fear it will be the best, for he kindly gave his consent, and I
know it would be hard for him to do as much for any man, much more so for
one not wholly to his mind.Miss Hargrove, I must appear awkwardness and
incoherency personified.I shall appear to
you fickle and unmanly.How can I excuse myself to you when I have no
excuse except the downright truth that I love you better than my life,
better than my own soul, better than all the world and everything in it.I never knew what love was until you became unconscious in my arms on the
mountain.I'm only trying to explain
myself; and yet I had thought that I knew, and had spoken words of love
to your friend, Amy Winfield, who is worthy of the love of the best and
noblest man that ever breathed.She did not welcome my words--they only
wounded her--and she has never eared for me except as a true and gentle
sister cares.But I promised to wait till she did care.You fascinated me from the first hour of our meeting.I feel now
that I cherished an unworthy purpose toward you.I thought that, by
attentions to you, I could make Amy care; I thought that you were but a
brilliant society girl; but every hour I spent with you increased my
admiration, my respect; I saw that you were better and stronger than I
was.On the first day we went into camp on the mountain I saw whither my
heart was leading me, and from that hour until to-day I have tried to
conquer my love, feeling that I had no right to give it, that you would
despise it if I did.You can't have any confidence in me now.All my hope
is that you will give me a chance to prove that I am not a fickle wretch.I will accept of any probation, I will submit to any terms.I can't take
an absolute refusal now, for I feel you are seeing me at my worst, and I
know that you could do with me anything you pleased."Her head bowed lower and lower as he poured out these words like a
torrent."Does Amy--have you told her that you cannot keep your promise
to her?""Oh, yes, I told her so a few hours ago--since I met you this afternoon.I was going away to the West, like a coward, to escape from my dilemma,
for I felt you would never listen to me after you knew that I had broken
my word to Amy.I feared that I had already become a by-word between you
for all that was weak and fickle.But after I saw you I could not go till
I spoke.I determined to reveal the whole truth, and if you ever gave me
a chance to retrieve myself, gratitude would be no name for my deep
feeling.She told me in good plain English that she
wanted neither me nor my promise; that she didn't think that she ever
could have loved me, no matter how long I might have waited.But I could
not look into your clear eyes and say, 'I love you,' and know that you
might learn from her or any one that I had said this before.If you won't
trust me, having had the whole truth, then I must bear my hard fate as
best I can.""How long would you be willing to wait for me?"she asked, in tones so
low that he could scarcely catch the words.He bounded to her side, and took her unresisting hand."Oh, Gertrude," he
pleaded, "prove me, give me a chance, let me show that I am not without
manhood and constancy.Believe me, I know the priceless gift I'm asking,
but what else can I do?I have tried for weeks to conquer the feeling you
have inspired, tried with all the help that pride and sense of duty and
honor could give, but it has been utterly useless.I now am free; I have
the right to speak.At last she raised her downcast eyes and averted face to his, and for a
moment he was dazed at their expression.In tones sweet, low, and deep
with her strong emotion, she said, "Burt, how glad I am that you men are
blind!I found out that I loved you before we went to our mountain camp."She sprang up and gave him her other hand as she continued: "Can love
impose such hard conditions as you suggest--months of doubtful waiting
for one who risked his life for me without a second's hesitation?That is
not my nature, Burt.If I have power over you, I shall show it in another
way."She would never forget his look as he listened to these words, nor his
humility as he lowered his head upon her shoulder, and murmured, "I am
not worthy of this."It touched the deepest and tenderest chord in her
heart.His feeling was not the exultation of success, but a gratitude too
deep for words, and a half-conscious appeal that she would use her
woman's power to evoke a better manhood.It was not mere acknowledgment
of her beauty, or the impulse of his passion; it was homage to the best
and noblest part of her nature, the expression of his absolute trust.Never had she received such a tribute, and she valued it more than if
Burt had laid untold wealth at her feet.A great joy is often as sobering as a great sorrow, and they talked long
and earnestly together.Gertrude would not become engaged until she had
told her mother, and shown her the respect that was her due."You must
not be resentful," the young girl said, "if mamma's consent is not easily
won.She has set her heart on an establishment in town, I've set my heart
on you; so there we differ, and you must give me time to reconcile her to
a different programme."The clock on the mantel chimed eleven, and Burt started up, aghast at the
flight of time.Gertrude stole to her father's library, and found that he
was pacing the floor."I should not have left him alone so long
to-night," she thought, with compunction."Papa," she said, "Mr.He looked into his daughter's flushed, happy face, and needed no further
explanation, and with her hands on his arm he went to the drawing-room.Burt said but few and very simple words, and the keen judge of men liked
him beter than if he had been more exuberant.There was evidence of
downright earnestness now that seemed a revelation of a new trait."You spoke of going to the West soon," Mr.Hargrove remarked, as they
lingered in parting."Have you any objection to telling me of your
purpose?"Hargrove's face soon expressed unusual interest."I
must talk with you further about this," he said."I have land in the same
locality, and also an interest in the railroad to which you refer.Perhaps I can make your journey of mutual service.""Oh, papa," cried his daughter, "you are my good genius!"for she well
understood what that mutual service meant.Hargrove said, "Well, well, this Western-land
business puts a new aspect on the affair, and mamma may have little
ground for complaint.It's my impression that the Cliffords will realize
a very respectable fortune out of that land.""Papa," said the young girl, "Burt gave me something better than wealth
to-night--better even than love, in the usual sense of the word.He acted as if he saw in me the power to help him to be a
true man, and what higher compliment can a woman receive?He did not
express it so much by word as by an unconscious manner, that was so
sincere and unpremeditated that it thrilled my very soul.Oh, papa, you
have helped me to be so very happy!"CHAPTER LVI

WEBB'S FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER


Webb's silent entrance had not been so quiet but that Burt heard him.Scarcely had he gained his room before the younger brother knocked, and
followed him in without waiting."Where have you been at this time of
night?""You are infringing on ghostly hours, and are
beginning to look like a ghost;" for Webb had thrown himself into a
chair, and was haggard from the exhaustion of his long conflict.The
light and kindly way in which he answered his brother proved that he was
victor."Webb," said Burt, putting his hand on the elder brother's shoulder, "you
saved my life last winter, and life has become of immense value to me.If
you had not found me, I should have missed a happiness that falls to the
lot of few--a happiness of which all your science can never give you, you
old delver, even an idea.I meant to tell mother and father first, but I
feel to-night how much I owe to your brave, patient search, and I want
your congratulations.""I think you might have told father and mother last night, for I suppose
it's morning now.""I did not get home in time, and did not wish to excite mother, and spoil
her rest.""Well, then, you might have come earlier or gone later.I think not, if you know all about what I didn't know, and
could scarcely believe possible myself, till an hour or two since."I think you might have stayed at home
with Amy to-night, of all times.An accident, Burt, revealed to me your
success, and I do congratulate you most sincerely.You have now the
truest and loveliest girl in the world.""That's true, but what possible accident could have revealed the fact to
you?""Don't think I was spying upon you.From the top of a ladder in the
orchard I saw, as the result of a casual glance, your reward to Amy for
words that must have been very satisfactory."Burt began to laugh as if he could not control himself."What a surprise
I have for you all!""I went where I did last night with Amy's
full knowledge and consent.She never cared a rap for me, but the only
other girl in the world who is her equal does, and her name is Gertrude
Hargrove."Webb gave a great start, and sank into a chair."Don't be so taken aback, old fellow.I suppose you and the rest had set
your hearts on my marrying Amy.You have only to follow Amy's example,
and give me your blessing.Yes, you saw me give Amy a very grateful and
affectionate greeting last evening.She's the dearest little sister that
ever a man had, and that's all she ever wanted to be to me.I felt
infernally mean when I came to her yesterday, for I was in an awkward
strait.I had promised to wait for her till she did care, but she told me
that there was no use in waiting, and I don't believe there would have
been.She would have seen some one in the future who would awaken a very
different feeling from any that I could inspire, and then, if she had
promised herself to me, she would have been in the same predicament that
I was.She is the best and most sensible little girl that ever breathed,
and feels toward me just as she does toward you, only she very justly
thinks you have forgotten more than lever knew.As for Gertrude--Hang it
all!You'll say I'm at my old
tricks, but I'm not.You've seen how circumstances have brought us
together, and I tell you my eye and heart are filled now for all time.She will be over to-morrow, and I want her to receive the greeting she
deserves."The affair seemed of such tremendous importance to Burt that he was not
in the least surprised that Webb was deeply moved, and fortunately he
talked long enough to give his brother time to regain his self-control.Webb did congratulate him in a way that was entirely satisfactory, and
then bundled him out of the room in the most summary manner, saying,
"Because you are a hare-brained lover, you shouldn't keep sane people
awake any longer."It were hard to say, however, who was the less sane
that night, Webb or Burt.The former threw open his window, and gazed at
the moonlit mountains in long, deep ecstasy.Unlike Burt's, his more
intense feeling would find quiet expression.All he knew was that there
was a chance for him--that he had the right to put forth the best effort
of which he was capable--and he thanked God for that.At the same time he
remembered Amy's parable of the rose.He would woo as warily as
earnestly.With Burt's experience before his eyes, he would never stun
her with sudden and violent declarations.His love, like sunshine, would
seek to develop the flower of her love.He was up and out in the October dawn, too happy and excited for sleep.His weariness was gone; his sinews seemed braced with steel as he strode
to a lofty eminence.No hue on the richly tinted leaves nor on the rival
chrysanthemums was brighter than his hope, and the cool, pure air, in
which there was as yet no frostiness, was like exhilarating wine.From
the height he looked down on his home, the loved casket of the more
dearly prized jewel.He viewed the broad acres on which he had toiled,
remembering with a dull wonder that once he had been satisfied with their
material products.Now there was a glamour upon them, and upon all the
landscape.The river gleamed and sparkled; the mountains flamed like the
plumage of some tropical bird.The earth and
his old materiality became the foundation-stones on which his awakened
mind, kindled and made poetic, should rear an airy, yet enduring,
structure of beauty, consecrated to Amy.He had loved nature before, but
it had been to him like a palace in which, as a dull serving-man, he had
employed himself in caring for its furniture and the frames of its
paintings.But he had been touched by a magic wand, and within the frames
glowed ever-changing pictures, and the furniture was seen to be the work
of divine art.The palace was no longer empty, but enshrined a living
presence, a lovely embodiment of Nature's purest and best manifestation.The development of no flower in all the past summer was so clear to him
as that of the girl he loved.He felt as if he had known her thoughts
from childhood.Her young womanhood was like that of the roses he had
shown to her in the dewy June dawn that seemed so long ago.It was still like a bud of his favorite
mossrose, wrapped in its green calyx.Oh, what a wealth of fragrant
beauty would be revealed!But she should
waken in her own time; and if he had not the power to impart the deep,
subtile impulse, then that nearest to her, Nature, should be his bride.They were all at the breakfast-table when he returned, and this plotter
against Amy's peace entered and greeted her with a very quiet
"Good-morning," but he laid beside her plate a four-leaved clover which
he had espied on his way back."Thanks, Webb," she said, with eyes full of merriment; "I foresee an
amazing amount of good luck in this little emblem.Indeed, I feel sure
that startling proofs of it will occur to-day;" and she looked
significantly at Burt, who laughed very consciously."What mischief has Burt been up to, Amy?""He was
ready to explode with suppressed something last evening at supper, and
now he is effervescing in somewhat different style, but quite as
remarkably.You boys needn't think you can hide anything from mother very
long; she knows you too well."Both Webb and Burt, with Amy, began to laugh, and they looked at each
other as if there were a good deal that mother did not know."Webb and Amy have evidently some joke on Burt," remarked Leonard."Webb
was out last night, and I bet a pippin he caught Burt flirting with Miss
Hargrove.""Burt is going to settle down now and be
steady.We'll make him sign a pledge before he goes West, won't we, Amy?""Yes, indeed," gasped Amy, almost beside herself with merriment; "he'll
have to sign one in big capitals.""Burt," said his father, looking at him over his spectacles, "you've been
getting yourself into some scrape as sure as the world.That's right,
Amy; you laugh at him well, and--"

"A truce!""If I'm in a scrape, I don't propose to get
out of it, but rather to make you all share in it.As Amy says, her
four-leaved clover will prove a true prophet, green as it looks.I now
beg off, and shall prove that my scrape has not spoiled my appetite.""Well," said Leonard, "I never could find any four-leaved clovers, but
I've had good luck, haven't I, Maggie?""You had indeed, when you came courting me.""I am satisfied," began Webb, "that I could develop acres of four-leaved
clover.I have counted twenty-odd on
one root.If seed from such a plant were sown, and then seed selected
again from the new plants most characterized by this'sport,' I believe
the trait would become fixed, and we could have a field of four-leaved
clover.New varieties of fruits, vegetables, and flowers are often thus
developed from chance'sports' or abnormal specimens.""He would turn this ancient symbol of fortune
into a marketable commodity.""Pardon me; I was saying what might be done, not what I proposed to do.I
found this emblem of good chance by chance, and I picked it with the
'wish' attacked to the stem.Thus to the utmost I have honored the
superstition, and you have only to make your wish to carry it out fully.""My wishes are in vain, and all the four-leaved clovers in the world
wouldn't help them.I wish I was a scientific problem, a crop that
required great skill to develop, a rare rose that all the rose-maniacs
were after, a new theory that required a great deal of consideration and
investigation, and accompanied with experiments that needed much
observation, and any number of other t-i-o-n-shuns.Then I shouldn't be
left alone evenings by the great inquiring mind of the family.Burt's
going away, and, as his father says, has got into a scrape; so what's to
become of me?"They all arose from the table amid general laughter, of which Webb and
Burt were equally the objects, and on the faces of those not in the
secret there was much perplexed curiosity.exclaimed Maggie, "if Webb should concentrate his mind
on you as you suggest, it would end by his falling in love with you."This speech was received with shouts of merriment, and Amy felt the color
rushing into her face, but she scouted the possibility."The idea of
Webb's falling in love with any one!""I should as soon expect
to see old Storm King toppling over.""Still waters run--" began Maggie, but a sudden flash from Webb's eyes
checked her."Some still waters don't run at all.Not
for the world would I have Webb incur the dreadful risk that you suggest.""I think I'm almost old enough to take care of myself, sister Amy, and I
promise you to try to be as entertaining as such an old fellow can be.As
to falling in love with you, that happened long ago--the first evening
you came, when you stood in the doorway blushing and frightened at the
crowd of your new relations.""Haven't I got over being afraid of them remarkably?I never was a bit
afraid of you even at first.It took me a long time, however, to find out
how learned you were, and what deep subjects are required to interest
you.Alas, I shall never be a deep subject."Clifford, putting his arm around her, "you have
come like sunshine into the old home, and we old people can't help
wishing you may never go out of it while we are alive.""I'm not a bit jealous, Amy," said Maggie."I think it's time this mutual admiration society broke up," the young
girl said, with tears trembling in her eyes."When I think of it all, and
what a home I've found, I'm just silly enough to cry.I think it's time,
Burt, that you obtained your father's and mother's forgiveness or
blessing, or whatever it is to be.""You are right, Amy, as you always are.and
if you will accompany us, sir (to his father), you shall learn the
meaning of Amy's four-leaved clover.""You needn't think you are going to get Amy without my consent," Leonard
called after him."I've known her longer than any of you--ever since she
was a little girl at the depot."Amy and Webb began laughing so heartily at the speaker that he went away
remarking that he could pick apples if he couldn't solve riddles."Come up to my room, Amy," said Maggie, excitedly."No, no, Mother Eve, I shall go to my own room, and dress for company.""Burt said something more than
good-by to Miss Hargrove last evening."Amy would not answer, and the sound of a mirthful snatch of song died
musically away in the distance.Webb," Maggie resumed, "what did _you_ mean by that ominous
flash from your cavern-like eyes?""It meant that Amy has probably been satisfied with one lover in the
family and its unexpected result.I don't wish our relations embarrassed
by the feeling that she must be on her guard against another.""Oh, I see, you don't wish her to be on her guard.""Dear Maggie, whatever you may see, appear blind.Heaven only knows what
you women don't see."I've suspected you for
some time, but thought Burt and Amy were committed to each other.""Amy does not suspect anything, and she must not.She is not ready for
the knowledge, and may never be.All the help I ask is to keep her
unconscious.I've been expecting you would find me out, for you married
ladies have had an experience which doubles your insight, and I'm glad of
the chance to caution you.Amy is happy in loving me as a brother.She
shall never be unhappy in this home if I can prevent it."Maggie entered heart and soul into Webb's cause, for he was a great
favorite with her.He was kind to her children, and in a quiet way taught
them almost as much as they learned at school.He went to his work with
mind much relieved, for she and his mother were the only ones that he
feared might surmise his feeling, and by manner or remark reveal it to
Amy, thus destroying their unembarrassed relations, and perhaps his
chance to win the girl's heart.CHAPTER LVII

OCTOBER HUES AND HARVESTS


Burt's interview with his parents, their mingled surprise, pleasure, and
disappointment, and their deep sympathy, need not be dwelt upon.Clifford was desirous of first seeing Amy, and satisfying himself that
she did not in the slightest degree feel herself slighted or treated in
bad faith, but his wife, with her low laugh, said: "Rest assured, father,
Burt is right.He has won nothing more from Amy than sisterly love,
though I had hoped that he might in time.We shall keep Amy, and gain a new daughter that we have already learned
to admire and love."Burt's mind was too full of the one great theme to remember what Mr.Hargrove had said about the Western land, and when at last Miss Hargrove
came to say good-by, with a blushing consciousness quite unlike her usual
self-possession, he was enchanted anew, and so were all the household.The old people's reception seemed like a benediction; Amy banished the
faintest trace of doubt by her mirthful ecstasies; and after their
mountain experience there was no ice to break between Gertrude and
Maggie.The former was persuaded to defer her trip to New York until the morrow,
and so Amy would have her nutting expedition after all.When Leonard came
down to dinner, Burt took Gertrude's hand, and said, "Now, Len, this is
your only chance to give your consent.You can't have any dinner till you
do."His swift, deprecating look at Amy's laughing face reassured him."Well,"
he said, slowly, as if trying to comprehend it all, "I do believe I'm
growing old.When _did_ all this take
place?""Your eyesight is not to blame, Leonard," said his wife, with much
superiority."It's because you are only a man.""That's all I ever pretended to be."Then, with a dignity that almost
surprised Gertrude, he, as eldest brother, welcomed her in simple,
heartfelt words.At the dinner-table Miss Hargrove referred to the Western land.Burt laid
down his knife and fork, and exclaimed, "I declare, I forgot all about
it!"Miss Hargrove laughed heartily as she said, "A high tribute to me!"and
then made known her father's statement that the Clifford tract in the
West adjoined his own, that it would soon be very valuable, and that he
was interested in the railroad approaching it."I left him," she
concluded, "poring over his maps, and he told me to say to you, sir" (to
Mr.Clifford), "that he wished to see you soon.""How about the four-leaved clover now?"In the afternoon they started for the chestnut-trees.Webb carried a light
ladder, and both he and Burt had dressed themselves in close-fitting
flannel suits for climbing.The orchard, as they passed through it,
presented a beautiful autumn picture.Great heaps of yellow and red cheeked
apples were upon the ground; other varieties were in barrels, some headed
up and ready for market, while Mr.Clifford was giving the final cooperage
to other barrels as fast as they were filled."Father can still head up a barrel better than any of us," Leonard
remarked to Miss Hargrove."Well, my dear," said the old gentleman, "I've had over half a century's
experience.""It's time I obtained some idea of rural affairs," said Gertrude to Webb."There seem to be many different kinds of apples here."Yes, as easily as you know different dress fabrics at Arnold's.Those
umbrella-shaped trees are Rhode Island greenings; those that are rather
long and slender branching are yellow bell-flowers; and those with short
and stubby branches and twigs are the old-fashioned dominies.Don't you see how green the fruit is?It will not be
in perfection till next March.Not only a summer, but an autumn and a
winter are required to perfect that superb apple, but then it becomes one
of Nature's triumphs.Some of those heaps on the ground will furnish
cider and vinegar.Nuts, cider, and a wood fire are among the privations
of a farmer's life.""Farming, as you carry it on, appears to me a fine art.How very full
some of the trees are!and others look as if they had been half picked
over."The largest and ripest apples are taken
off first, and the rest of the fruit improves wonderfully in two or three
weeks.By this course we greatly increase both the quality and the bulk
of the crop.""You are very happy in your calling, Webb.How strange it seems for me to
be addressing you as Webb!""It does not seem so strange to me; nor does it seem strange that I am
talking to you in this way.I soon recognized that you were one of those
fortunate beings in whom city life had not quenched nature."They had fallen a little behind the others, and were out of ear-shot."I think," she said, hesitatingly and shyly, "that I had an ally in you
all along."He laughed and replied, "At one time I was very dubious over my
expedition to Fort Putnam.""I imagine that in suggesting that expedition you put in two words for
yourself.""I wish you might be as happy as I am.I'm not blind either, and I wonder
that Amy is so unconscious.""I hope she will remain so until she awakens as naturally as from sleep.She has never had a brother, and as such I try to act toward her.My one
thought is her happiness, and, perhaps, I can secure it in no other way.I feared long since that you had guessed my secret, and am grateful that
you have not suggested it to Amy.Few would have shown so much delicacy
and consideration.""I'm not sure that you are right, Webb.If Amy knew of your feeling, it
would influence her powerfully."Yes, it was necessary that she should misunderstand me, and think of me
as absorbed in things remote from her life.The knowledge you suggest
might make her very sad, for there never was a gentler-hearted girl.Please use it to prevent the constraint which might
arise between us."Burt now joined them with much pretended jealousy, and they soon reached
the trees, which, under the young men's vigorous blows, rained down the
prickly burrs, downy chestnuts, and golden leaves.Blue jays screamed
indignantly from the mountain-side, and squirrels barked their protest at
the inroads made upon their winter stores.As the night approached the
air grew chilly, and Webb remarked that frost was coming at last.He
hastened home before the others to cover up certain plants that might be
sheltered through the first cold snap.The tenderer ones had long since
been taken up and prepared for winter blooming.To Amy's inquiry where Johnnie was, Maggie had replied that she had gone
nutting by previous engagement with Mr.Alvord, and as the party returned
in the glowing evening they met the oddly assorted friends with their
baskets well filled.In the eyes of the recluse there was a gentler
expression, proving that Johnnie's and Nature's ministry had not been
wholly in vain.He glanced swiftly from Burt to Miss Hargrove, then at
Amy, and a faint suggestion of a smile hovered about his mouth.He was
about to leave them abruptly when Johnnie interposed, pleading: "Mr.Alvord, don't go home till I pick you some of your favorite heart's-ease,
as you call my <DW29>s.They have grown to be as large and beautiful as
they were last spring.Do you know, in the hot weather they were almost
as small as johnny-jumpers?but I wouldn't let 'em be called by that
name.""They will ever be heart's-ease to me, Johnnie-doubly so when you give
them," and he followed her to the garden.In the evening a great pitcher of cider fresh from the press, flanked by
dishes of golden fall pippins and grapes, was placed on the table.The
young people roasted chestnuts on hickory coals, and every one, even to
the invalid, seemed to glow with a kindred warmth and happiness.The city
belle contrasted the true home-atmosphere with the grand air of a city
house, and thanked God for her choice.At an early hour she said good-by
for a brief time and departed with Burt.He was greeted with stately
courtesy by Mrs.Hargrove herself, whom her husband and the prospective
value of the Western land had reconciled to the momentous event.Burt and
Gertrude were formally engaged, and he declared his intention of
accompanying her to the city to procure the significant diamond.After the culminating scenes of Burt's little drama, life went on very
serenely and quietly at the Clifford home.Out of school hours Alf,
Johnnie, and Ned vied with the squirrels in gathering their hoard of
various nuts.The boughs in the orchard grew lighter daily.Frost came as
Webb had predicted, and dahlias, salvias, and other flowers, that had
flamed and glowed till almost the middle of October, turned black in one
morning's sun.The butternut-trees had lost their foliage, and countless
leaves were fluttering down in every breeze like many-hued gems.The
richer bronzed colors of the oak were predominating in the landscape, and
only the apple, cherry, and willow trees about the house kept up the
green suggestion of summer.CHAPTER LVIII

THE MOONLIGHT OMEN


Webb permitted no marked change in his manner.He toiled steadily with
Leonard in gathering the fall produce and in preparing for winter, but
Amy noticed that his old preoccupied look was passing away.Daily he
appeared to grow more genial and to have more time and thought for her.With increasing wonder she learned the richness and fulness of his mind.In the evenings he read aloud to them all with his strong, musical
intonation, in which the author's thought was emphasized so clearly that
it seemed to have double the force that it possessed when she read the
same words herself.He found time for occasional rambles and horseback
excursions, and was so companionable during long rainy days that they
seemed to her the brightest of the week.Maggie smiled to herself and saw
that Webb's spell was working.He was making himself so quietly and
unobtrusively essential to Amy that she would find half of her life gone
if she were separated from him.Gertrude returned for a short time, and then went to the city for the
winter.He was much in New York, and
often with Mr.Hargrove, from whom he was receiving instructions in
regard to his Western expedition.That gentleman's opinion of Burt's
business capacity grew more favorable daily, for the young fellow now
proposed to show that he meant to take life in earnest."If this lasts he
will make a trusty young lieutenant," the merchant thought, "and I can
make his fortune while furthering mine."Burt had plenty of brains and
good executive ability to carry out the wiser counsels of others, while
his easy, vivacious manner won him friends and acceptance everywhere.It was arranged, after his departure, that Amy should visit her friend in
the city, and Webb looked forward to her absence with dread and
self-depreciation, fearing that he should suffer by contrast with the
brilliant men of society, and that the quiet country life would seem
dull, indeed, thereafter.Before Amy went on this visit there came an Indian summer morning in
November, that by its soft, dreamy beauty wooed every one out of doors."Amy," said Webb, after dinner, "suppose we drive over to West Point and
return by moonlight."She was delighted with the idea, and they were soon
slowly ascending the mountain.He felt that this was his special
opportunity, not to break her trustful unconsciousness, but to reveal his
power to interest her and make impressions that should be enduring.He
exerted every faculty to please, recalling poetic and legendary allusions
connected with the trees, plants, and scenes by which they were passing."Oh, Webb, how you idealize nature!""You make every object
suggest something fanciful, beautiful, or entertaining.How have you
learned to do it?""As I told you last Easter Sunday--how long ago it seems--if I have any
power for such idealization it is largely through your influence.My
knowledge was much like the trees as they then appeared.I was prepared
for better things, but the time for them had not yet come.I had studied
the material world in a material sort of way, employing my mind with
facts that were like the bare branches and twigs.You awakened in me a
sense of the beautiful side of nature.Who can
explain the rapid development of foliage and flowers when all is ready?""But, Webb, you appeared, during the summer, to go back to your old
materiality worse than ever.You made me feel that I had no power to do
anything for you.You treated me as if I were your very little sister who
would have to go to school a few years before I could be your companion.""Those were busy days," he replied, laughing."Besides," he added,
hesitatingly, "Burt was at one time inclined to be jealous.Of course, it
was very absurd in him, but I suppose lovers are always a little absurd."I saw whither Burt was drifting long
ago--at the time of the great flood which swept away things of more value
than my silly expectations.What an unsophisticated little goose I was!I
suppose Johnnie expects to be married some day, and in much the same way
I looked forward to woman's fate; and since you all seemed to wish that
it should be Burt, I thought, 'Why not?'Wasn't it lucky for Burt, and,
indeed, for all of you, that I was not a grown-up and sentimental young
woman?Hargrove, by uniting his interests with yours in the West,
will make your fortunes, and Burt will bring you a lovely sister.It
pleases me to see how Gertrude is learning to like you.I used to be
provoked with her at first, because she didn't appreciate you.Do you
know, I think you ought to write?You could make people fall in love with
nature.Americans don't care half as much for out-door life and pursuits
as the English.It seems to me that city life cannot compare with that of
the country.""You may think differently after you have been a few weeks in Gertrude's
elegant home."They had paused again on the brow of Cro' Nest, and were looking out on
the wide landscape."No, Webb," she said; "her home, no doubt, is
elegant, but it is artificial.This is simple and grand, and to-day, seen
through the soft haze, is lovely to me beyond all words.I honestly half
regret that I am going to town.Of course, I shall enjoy myself--I always
do with Gertrude--but the last few quiet weeks have been so happy and
satisfying that I dread any change.""Think of the awful vacuum that your absence will make in the old home!""Well, I'm a little glad; I want to be missed.But I shall write to you
and tell you of all the frivolous things we are doing.Besides, you must
come to see me as often as you can."They saw evening parade, the moon rising meanwhile over Sugarloaf
Mountain, and filling the early twilight with a soft radiance.The music
seemed enchanting, for their hearts were attuned to it.As the long line
of cadets shifted their guns from "carry arms" to "shoulder arms" with
instantaneous action, Webb said that the muskets sent out a shivering
sound like that of a tree almost ready to fall under the last blows of an
axe.Webb felt that should he exist millions of ages he should never forget the
ride homeward.The moon looked through the haze like a veiled beauty, and
in its softened light Amy's pure, sweet profile was endowed with ethereal
beauty.The beech trees, with their bleached leaves still clinging to them,
were almost spectral, and the oaks in their bronzed foliage stood like
black giants by the roadside.There were suggestive vistas of light and
shadow that were full of mystery, making it easy to believe that on a night
like this the mountain was haunted by creatures as strange as the fancy
could shape.The supreme gift of a
boundless love overflowed his heart to his very lips.She was so near, and
the spell of her loveliness so strong, that at times he felt that he must
give it expression, but he ever restrained himself.His words might bring
pain and consternation to the peaceful face.She was alone with him, and
there would be no escape should he speak now.No; he had resolved to wait
till her heart awoke by its own impulses, and he would keep his purpose
even through the witchery of that moonlight drive."How strangely isolated
we are," he thought, "that such feeling as mine can fill my very soul with
its immense desire, and she not be aware of anything but my quiet,
fraternal manner!"As they were descending the home <DW72> of the mountain they witnessed a
rare and beautiful sight.A few light clouds had gathered around the
moon, and these at last opened in a rift.The rays of light through the
misty atmosphere created the perfect colors of a rainbow, and this
phenomenon took the remarkable form of a shield, its base resting upon
one cloud, and its point extending into a little opening in the cloud
above."Was there ever anything so
strange and lovely?"Webb checked his horse, and they looked at the vision with wonder."I
never saw anything to equal that," said Webb.she asked, turning a little from him that she
might look upward, and leaning on his shoulder with the unconsciousness
of a child."Let us make it one, dear sister Amy," he said, drawing her nearer to
him."Let it remind you, as you recall it, that as far as I can I will
ever shield you from every evil of life."As he spoke the rainbow colors
became wonderfully distinct, and then faded slowly away.Her head drooped
lower on his shoulder, and she said, dreamily:

"It seems to me that I never was so happy before in my life as I am now.You are so different, and can be so much to me, now that your old absurd
constraint is gone.Oh, Webb, you used to make me so unhappy!You made me
feel that you had found me out--how little I knew, and that it was a bore
to have to talk with me and explain.I went everywhere with papa, and he always appeared to think
of me as a little girl.And then during the last year or two of his life
he was so ill that I did not do much else than watch over him with fear
and trembling, and try to nurse him and beguile the hours that were so
full of pain and weakness.But I'm not contented to be ignorant, and you
can teach me so much.I fairly thrill with excitement and feeling
sometimes when you are reading a fine or beautiful thing.If I can feel
that way I can't be stupid, can I?""Think how much faster I could learn this winter if you would direct my
reading, and explain what is obscure!""I will very gladly do anything you wish.There is a stupidity of heart which is
far worse than that of the mind, a selfish callousness in regard to
others and their rights and feelings, which mars the beauty of some women
worse than physical deformity.From the day you entered our home as a
stranger, graceful tact, sincerity, and the impulse of ministry have
characterized your life.Can you imagine that mere cleverness, trained
mental acuteness, and a knowledge of facts can take the place of these
traits?No man can love unless he imagines that a woman has these
qualities, and bitter will be his disappointment if he finds them
wanting."Her laugh rang out musically on the still air."I believe you have constructed an ideally perfect
creature out of nature, and that you hold trysts with her on moonlight
nights, you go out to walk so often alone.Well, well, I won't be jealous
of such a sister-in-law, but I want to keep you a little while longer
before you follow Burt's example.""I shall never give you a sister-in-law, Amy.""You don't know what you'll do.If you ever love, it will be for always; and I don't
like to think of it.I'd like to keep you just as you are.Now that you
see how selfish I am, where is woman's highest charm?"Webb laughed, and urged his horse into a sharp trot."I am unchangeable
in my opinions too, as far as you are concerned," he remarked."She is
not ready yet," was his silent thought.When she came down to the late supper her eyes were shining with
happiness, and Maggie thought the decisive hour had come; but in answer
to a question about the drive, Amy said, "I couldn't have believed that
so much enjoyment was to be had in one afternoon.Webb is a brother worth
having, and I'm sorry I'm going to New York.""Oh, you are excellent, as far as you go, but you are so wrapped up in
Maggie that you are not of much account; and as for Burt, he is more over
head and ears than you are.Even if a woman was in love, I should think
she would like a man to be sensible."you don't know what you are talking About," said Maggie.I suppose it is a kind of disease, and that all are more
or less out of their heads.""We've been out of our heads a good many years, mother, haven't we?""Well," said Leonard, "I just hope Amy will catch the disease, and have
it very bad some day."When I do, I'll send for Dr.A few days later Webb took her to New York, and left her with her friend."Don't be persuaded into staying very long," he found opportunity to say,
in a low tone."Indeed I won't; I'm homesick already;" and she looked after him very
wistfully.Gertrude looked so hurt and disappointed
when she spoke of returning, and had planned so much, that days
lengthened into weeks.CHAPTER LIX

THE HOSE REVEALS ITS HEART


Webb returned to a region that was haunted.Wherever he went, a presence
was there before him.In every room, on the lawn, in the garden, in lanes
no longer shaded, but carpeted with brown, rustling leaves, on mountain
roads, he saw Amy with almost the vividness of actual vision, as he had
seen her in these places from the time of her first coming.At church he
created her form in her accustomed seat, and his worship was a little
confused.She had asked him to write, and he made home life and the
varying aspects of nature real to her.His letters, however, were so
impersonal that she could read the greater part of them to Gertrude, who
had resolved to be pleased out of good-will to Webb, and with the
intention of aiding his cause.But she soon found herself expressing
genuine wonder and delight at their simple, vigorous diction, their
subtile humor, and the fine poetic images they often suggested."Oh,
Amy," she said, "I couldn't have believed it.I don't think he himself is
aware of his power of expression.""He has read and observed so much," Amy replied, "that he has much to
express.""It's more than that," said Gertrude; "there are touches here and there
which mere knowledge can't account for.They have a delicacy and beauty
which seem the result of woman's influence, and I believe it is yours.I
should think you would be proud of him.""I am," she answered, with exultation and heightened color, "but it seems
absurd to suppose that such a little ignoramus as I am can help him
much."Meanwhile, to all appearance, Webb maintained the even tenor of his way.He had been so long schooled in patience that he waited and hoped on in
silence as before, and busied himself incessantly.The last of the corn
was husked, and the golden treasure stored.The stalks were stacked near
the barn for winter use, and all the labors of the year were rounded out
and completed.Twice he went to the city to see Amy, and on one of these
occasions he was a guest at a large party given in her honor.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.During much
of the evening he was dazzled by her beauty, and dazed by her
surroundings.Her father had had her instructed carefully in dancing, and
she and Burt had often waltzed together, but he could scarcely believe
his eyes as she appeared on the floor unsurpassed in beauty and grace,
her favor sought by all.Was that the simple girl who on the shaggy sides
of Storm King had leaned against his shoulder?Miss Hargrove gave him little time for such musings.She, as hostess,
often took his arm and made him useful.The ladies found him reserved
rather than shy, but he was not long among the more mature and thoughtful
men present before a knot gathered around him, and some of Mr.Hargrove's
more intimate friends ventured to say, "There seems to be plenty of
brains in the family into which your daughter is to enter."After an hour or two had passed, and Amy had not had a chance to speak to
him, he began to look so disconsolate that she came and whispered,
"What's the matter, old fellow?""Oh, Amy," he replied, discontentedly, "I wish we were back on Storm
King."So do I," she said, "and so we will be many a time again.But you are
not out of place here.I heard one lady remarking how'reserved and
_distingue_ you were, and another," she added, with a flash of her
ever-ready mirthfulness, "said you were 'deliciously homely.'I was just
delighted with that compliment," and she flitted away to join her partner
in the dance.Webb brightened up amazingly after this, and before he
departed in the "wee sma' hours," when the rooms were empty, Gertrude
gave him a chance for a brief, quiet talk, which proved that Amy's heart
was still in the Highlands, even if he did not yet possess it.Burt would not return till late in December; but Amy came home about the
middle of the month, and received an ovation that was enough "to turn any
one's head," she declared.Their old quiet life was resumed, and Webb
watched keenly for any discontent with it."I've had my little fling," she said, "and I suppose it was
time I saw more of the world and society, but oh, what a refuge and haven
of rest the old place is!Gertrude is lovely, her father very gallant and
polite, but Mrs.Hargrove's stateliness oppresses me, and in society I
felt that I had to take a grain of salt with everything said to me.Gertrude showed her sense in preferring a home.I was in some superb
houses in the city that did not seem like homes."Webb, in his solicitude that the country-house should not appear dull,
found time to go out with her on pleasant days, and to interest her
deeply in a course of reading.It was a season of leisure; but his mother
began to smile to herself as she saw how absorbed he was in his pupil.The nights grew colder, the stars gained a frosty glitter, the ground was
rock-like, and the ponds were covered with a glare of black ice.Amy was
eager to learn to skate, and Webb found his duty of instructor
delightful.Little danger of her falling, although, with a beginner's
awkwardness, she essayed to do so often; strong arms were ever near and
ready, and any one would have been glad to catch Amy in such peril.They were now looking forward to Burt's return and the holiday season,
which Gertrude would spend with them.Not merely the shops, but busy and stealthy fingers, would furnish the
gifts.Webb had bought his present for Amy, but had also burned the
midnight oil in the preparation of another--a paper for a magazine, and
it had been accepted.He had planned and composed it while at work
stripping the husks from the yellow corn, superintending the wood teams
and the choppers in the mountain, and aiding in cutting from an adjacent
pond the crystal blocks of ice--the stored coolness for the coming
summer.Then while others thought him sleeping he wrote and rewrote the
thoughts he had harvested during the day.One of his most delightful tasks, however, was in aiding Amy to embower
the old house in wreaths and festoons of evergreens.The rooms grew into
aromatic bowers.Autumn leaves and ferns gave to the heavier decorations
a light, airy beauty which he had never seen before.Grace itself Amy
appeared as she mounted the step-ladder and reached here and there,
twining and coaxing everything into harmony.What was the effect of all this companionship on her mind?She least of
all could have answered: she did not analyze.She was being carried forward on a shining tide of happiness, and
yet its motion was so even, quiet, and strong that there was nothing to
disturb her maidenly serenity.If Webb had been any one but Webb, and if
she had been in the habit of regarding all men as possible admirers, she
would have understood herself long before this.If she had been brought
up with brothers in her own home she would have known that she welcomed
this quiet brother with a gladness that had a deeper root than sisterly
affection.But the fact that he was Webb, the quiet, self-controlled man
who had called her sister Amy for a year, made his presence, his deep
sympathy with her and for her, seem natural.His approaches had been so
gradual that he was stealing into her heart as spring enters a flower.You can never name the first hour of its presence; you take no note of
the imperceptible yet steady development.The process is quiet, yet vital
and sure, and at last there comes an hour when the bud is ready to open.That time was near, and Webb hoped that it was.His tones were now and
then so tender and gentle that she looked at him a little wonderingly,
but his manner was quiet and far removed from that of the impetuous Burt.There was a warmth in it, however, like the increasing power of the sun,
and in human hearts bleak December can be the spring-time as truly as
May.It was the twenty-third--one of the stormiest days of a stormy month.The
snowflakes were whirling without, and making many a circle in the gale
before joining their innumerable comrades that whitened the ground.The
wind sighed and soughed about the old house as it had done a year before,
but Webb and Amy were armed against its mournfulness.They were in the
parlor, on whose wide hearth glowed an ample fire.Burt and Gertrude were
expected on the evening train."Gertie is coming home through the snow just as I did," said Amy,
fastening a spray of mistletoe that a friend had sent her from England to
the chandelier; "and the same old warm welcome awaits her.""What a marvellous year it has been!"Burt is engaged to one of whose
existence he did not know a year ago.He has been out West, and found
that you have land that will make you all rich.""Are these the greatest marvels of the year, Amy?"I didn't know you a year ago to-day, and now
I seem to have known you always, you great patient, homely old
fellow--'deliciously homely.'"The eyes of scores of young fellows looked at you that evening as if you
were deliciously handsome.""And you looked at me one time as if you hadn't a friend in the world,
and you wanted to be back in your native wilds.""Not without you, Amy; and you said you wished you were looking at the
rainbow shield with me again.""Oh, I didn't say all that; and then I saw you needed heartening up a
little."You were dancing with a terrible swell, worth, it was
said, half a million, who was devouring you with his eyes.""I'm all here, thank you, and you look as if you were doing some
devouring yourself."Yes, some color, but it's just as Nature arranged it, and you know
Nature's best work always fascinates me."There, don't you think that is arranged
well?"and she stood beneath the mistletoe looking up critically at it."Let me see if it is," and he advanced to her side."This is the only
test," he said, and quick as a flash he encircled her with his arm and
pressed a kiss upon her lips.She sprang aloof and looked at him with dilating eyes.He had often
kissed her before, and she had thought nothing more of it than of a
brother's salute.Was it a subtile, mysterious power in the mistletoe
itself with which it had been endowed by ages of superstition?Was that
kiss like the final ray of the Jane sun that opens the heart of the rose
when at last it is ready to expand?She looked at him wonderingly,
tremblingly, the color of the rose mounting higher and higher, and
deepening as if the blood were coming from the depths of her heart.In answer to her wondering, questioning look, he only bent
full upon her his dark eyes that had held hers once before in a moment of
terror.She saw his secret in their depths at last, the devotion, the
love, which she herself had unsuspectingly said would "last always."She
took a faltering step toward him, then covered her burning face with her
hands."Amy," he said, taking her gently in his arms, "do you understand me now?Dear, blind little girl, I have been worshipping all these months, and
you have not known it.""I--I thought you were in love with nature," she whispered."So I am, and you are nature in its sweetest and highest embodiment.Every beautiful thing in nature has long suggested you to me.It seems to me now that I
have loved you almost from the first hour I saw you.I have known that I
loved you ever since that June evening when you left me in the rose
garden.Have I not proved that I can be patient and wait?"She only pressed her burning face closer upon his shoulder."It's all
growing clear now," she again whispered."I can be 'only your brother,' if you so wish," he said, gravely."Your
happiness is my first thought."She looked up at him shyly, tears in her eyes, and a smile hovering about
her tremulous lips."I don't think I understood myself any better than I
did you.I never had a brother, and--and--I don't believe I loved you
just right for a brother;" and her face was hidden again.His eyes went up to heaven, as if he meant that his mating should be
recognized there.Then gently stroking her brown hair, he asked, "Then I
shan't have to wait, Amy?"cried Webb, lifting the dewy, flower-like
face and kissing it again and again."Oh, I beg your pardon; I didn't know," began Mr.Clifford from the
doorway, and was about to make a hasty and excited retreat."A year ago you received this dear girl as
your daughter.She has consented to make the tie closer still if
possible."The old gentleman took Amy in his arms for a moment, and then said, "This
is too good to keep to myself for a moment," and he hastened the
blushing, laughing girl to his wife, and exclaimed, "See what I've
brought you for a Christmas present.See what that sly, silent Webb has
been up to.He has been making love to our Amy right under our noses, and
we didn't know it.""_You_ didn't know it, father; mother's eyes are not so blind.Amy,
darling, I've been hoping and praying for this.You have made a good
choice, my dear, if it is his mother that says it.Webb will never
change, and he will always be as gentle and good to you as he has been to
me.""Well, well, well," said Mr.Clifford, "our cup is running over, sure
enough.Maggie, come here," he called, as he heard her step in the hall.I once felt a little like grumbling because we
hadn't a daughter, and now I have three, and the best and prettiest in
the land."Didn't I, Webb--as long ago as last October, too?""Oh, Webb, you ought to have told me first," said Amy, reproachfully,
when they were alone."I did not tell Maggie; she saw," Webb answered.Then, taking a rosebud
which she had been wearing, he pushed open the petals with his finger,
and asked, "Who told me that 'this is no way for a flower to bloom'?I've
watched and waited till your heart was ready, Amy."And so the time flew
in mutual confidences, and the past grew clear when illumined by love.said Amy, with a mingled sigh and laugh."There you were
growing as gaunt as a scarecrow, and I loving you all the time.If you had looked at Gertrude as Burt did I should
have found myself out long ago.Why hadn't you the sense to employ Burt's
tactics?""Because I had resolved that nature should be my sole ally.Was not my
kiss under the mistletoe a better way of awakening my sleeping beauty
than a stab of jealousy?""Yes, Webb, dear, patient Webb.The rainbow shield was a true omen, and I
am sheltered indeed."CHAPTER LX

CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND SHADOWS


Leonard had long since gone to the depot, and now the chimes of his
returning bells announced that Burt and Gertrude were near.To them both
it was in truth a coming home.Gertrude rushed in, followed by the
exultant Burt, her brilliant eyes and tropical beauty rendered tenfold
more effective by the wintry twilight without; and she received a welcome
that accorded with her nature.She was hardly in Amy's room, which she
was to share, before she looked in eager scrutiny at her friend.Oh, you little
wild-flower, you've found out that he is saying his prayers to you at
last, have you?Evidently he hasn't said them in vain.Oh, Amy darling, I was true to you and didn't
lose Burt either."Maggie had provided a feast, and Leonard beamed on the table and on every
one, when something in Webb and Amy's manner caught his attention."This
occasion," he began, "reminds me of a somewhat similar one a year ago
to-morrow night.It is my good fortune to bring lovely women into this
household.My first and best effort was made when I brought Maggie.Then
I picked up a little girl at the depot, and she grew into a tall, lovely
creature on the way home, didn't she, Johnnie?And now to-night I've
brought in a princess from the snow, and one of these days poor Webb will
be captured by a female of the MacStinger type, for he will never muster
up courage enough--What on earth are you all laughing about?""Thank you," said Amy, looking like a peony."You had better put your head under Maggie's wing and subside," Webb
added.Then, putting his arm about Amy, he asked, "Is this a female of
the MacStinger type?""Well," said he, at last, "when
_did_ this happen?When I was
courting, the whole neighborhood was talking about it, and knew I was
accepted long before I did.Did you see all this going on, Maggie?""Now, I don't believe Amy saw it herself," cried Leonard, half
desperately, and laughter broke out anew."Oh, Amy, I'm so glad!"said Burt, and he gave her the counterpart of the
embrace that had turned the bright October evening black to Webb."To think that Webb should have got such a prize!""Well, well, the boys in this family are in luck.""It will be my turn next," cried Johnnie."No, sir; I'm the oldest," Alf protested."Let's have supper," Ned remarked, removing his thumb from his mouth."Score one for Ned," said Burt."There is at least one member of the
family whose head is not turned by all these marvellous events."Can the sunshine and fragrance of a June day be photographed?No more can
the light and gladness of that long, happy evening be portrayed.Clifford held Gertrude's hand as she had Amy's when receiving her as a
daughter.The beautiful girl, whose unmistakable metropolitan air was
blended with gentle womanly grace, had a strong fascination for the
invalid.She kindled the imagination of the recluse, and gave her a
glimpse into a world she had never known."Webb," said Amy, as they were parting for the night, "I can see a sad,
pale orphan girl clad in mourning.I can see you kissing her for the
first time.I had a strange little thrill at heart
then, and you said, 'Come to me, Amy, when you are in trouble.'There is
one thing that troubles me to-night.All whom I so dearly love know of my
happiness but papa."Tell it to him, Amy," he answered, gently, "and tell it to God."There were bustle and renewed mystery on the following day.Astonishing-looking packages were smuggled from one room to another.Ned created a succession of panics, and at last the ubiquitous and
garrulous little urchin had to be tied into a chair.Johnnie and Alf
were in the seventh heaven of anticipation, and when Webb brought Amy
a check for fifty dollars, and told her that it was the proceeds of
his first crop from his brains, and that she must spend the money, she
went into Mr.Clifford's room waving it as if it were a trophy such as
no knight had ever brought to his lady-love."Of course, I'll spend it," she cried.It
shall go into books that we can read together.What's that agricultural
jargon of yours, Webb, about returning as much as possible to the soil?We'll return this to the soil," she said, kissing his forehead, "although
I think it is too rich for me already."In the afternoon she and Webb, with a sleigh well laden, drove into the
mountains on a visit to Lumley.He had repaired the rough, rocky lane
leading through the wood to what was no longer a wretched hovel.The
inmates had been expecting this visit, and Lumley rushed bareheaded
out-of-doors the moment he heard the bells.Although he had swept a path
from his door again and again, the high wind would almost instantly drift
in the snow.Poor Lumley had never heard of Sir Walter Raleigh or Queen
Elizabeth, but he had given his homage to a better queen, and with loyal
impulse he instantly threw off his coat, and laid it on the snow, that
Amy might walk dry-shod into the single room that formed his home.She
and Webb smiled significantly at each other, and then the young girl put
her hand into that of the mountaineer as he helped her from the sleigh,
and said "Merry Christmas!"with a smile that brought tears into the eyes
of the grateful man."Yer making no empty wish, Miss Amy.I never thought sich a Christmas 'ud
ever come to me or mine.But come in, come in out of the cold wind, an'
see how you've changed everything.Webb, and I'll tie
an' blanket your hoss.Lord, to think that sich a May blossom 'ud go into
my hut!"Lumley, neatly clad in some dark woollen material,
made a queer, old-fashioned courtesy that her husband had had her
practice for the occasion.But the baby, now grown into a plump, healthy
child, greeted her benefactress with nature's own grace, crowing,
laughing, and calling, "Pitty lady; nice lady," with exuberant welcome.The inmates did not now depend for precarious warmth upon two logs,
reaching across a dirty floor and pushed together, but a neat box,
painted green, was filled with billets of wood.The carpeted floor was
scrupulously clean, and so was the bright new furniture.A few evergreen
wreaths hung on the walls with the pictures that Amy had given, and on
the mantel was her photograph--poor Lumley's patron saint.Webb brought in his armful of gifts, and Amy took the child on her lap
and opened a volume of dear old "Mother Goose," profusely illustrated in
 prints--that classic that appeals alike to the hearts of
children, whether in mountain hovels or city palaces.The man looked on
as if dazed.Webb," he said, in his loud whisper, "I once saw a
picter of the Virgin and Child.Oh, golly, how she favors it!"Lumley," Amy began, "I think your housekeeping does you much
credit.I've not seen a neater room anywhere.""Well, mum, my ole man's turned over a new leaf sure nuff.There's no
livin' with him unless everythink is jesso, an, I guess it's better so,
too.Ef I let things git slack, he gits mighty savage.""You must try to be patient, Mr.You've made great changes for
the better, but you must remember that old ways can't be broken up in a
moment.""Lor' bless yer, Miss Amy, there's no think like breakin' off short,
there's nothink like turnin' the corner sharp, and fightin' the devil
tooth and nail.It's an awful tussle at first, an' I thought I was goin'
to knuckle under more'n once.So I would ef it hadn't 'a ben fer you, but
you give me this little ban', Miss Amy, an' looked at me as if I wa'n't a
beast, an' it's ben a liftin' me up ever sence.Oh, I've had good folks
talk at me an' lecter, an' I ben in jail, but it all on'y made me mad.The best on 'em wouldn't 'a teched me no more than they would a rattler,
sich as we killed on the mountain.But you guv me yer han', Miss Amy, an'
thar's mine on it agin; I'm goin' to be a _man_."She took the great horny palm in both her hands."You make me very
happy," she said, simply, looking at him above the head of his child,
"and I'm sure your wife is going to help you.I shall enjoy the holidays
far more for this visit.You've told us good news, and we've got good
news for you and your wife."Yes, Lumley," said Webb, clapping the man on the shoulder, "famous news.This little girl has been helping me just as much as she has you, and she
has promised to help me through life.One of these days we shall have a
home of our own, and you shall have a cottage near it, and the little
girl here that you've named Amy shall go to school and have a better
chance than you and your wife have had."exclaimed the man, almost breaking out into a
hornpipe."The Lord on'y knows what will happen ef things once git a
goin' right!Webb, thar's my han' agin'.Ef yer'd gone ter heaven fer
her, yer couldn't 'a got sich a gell.Well, well, give me a chance on yer
place, an' I'll work fer yer all the time, even nights an' Sundays."The child dropped her books and toys,
and clung to Amy."She knows yer; she knows all about yer," said the
delighted father."Well, ef yer must go, yer'll take suthin' with us;"
and from a great pitcher of milk he filled several goblets, and they all
drank to the health of little Amy."Yer'll fin' half-dozen pa'triges
under the seat, Miss Amy," he said, as they drove away."I was bound I'd
have some kind of a present fer yer."She waved her hand back to him, and saw him standing bareheaded in the
cutting wind, looking after her."Poor old Lumley was right," said Webb, drawing her to him; "I do feel as
if I had received my little girl from heaven.We will give those people a
chance, and try to turn the law of heredity in the right direction."Alvord sat over his lonely hearth,
his face buried in his hands.The day had been terribly long and
torturing; memory had presented, like mocking spectres, his past and what
it might have been.A sense of loneliness, a horror of great darkness,
overwhelmed him.Nature had grown cold and forbidding, and was losing its
power to solace.Johnnie, absorbed in her Christmas preparations, had not
been to see him for a long time.He had gone to inquire after her on the
previous evening, and through the lighted window of the Clifford home had
seen a picture that had made his own abode appear desolate indeed.In
despairing bitterness he had turned away, feeling that that happy home
was no more a place for him than was heaven.He had wandered out into the
storm for hours, like a lost spirit, and at last had returned and slept
in utter exhaustion.On the morning preceding Christmas memory awoke with
him, and as night approached he was sinking into sullen, dreary apathy.There was a light tap at the door, but he did not hear it.A child's face
peered in at his window, and Johnnie saw him cowering over his dying
fire.She had grown accustomed to his moods, and had learned to be
fearless, for she had banished his evil spells before.Therefore she
entered softly, laid down her bundles and stood beside him.she said, laying her hand on his shoulder.He started up,
and at the same moment a flickering blaze rose on the hearth, and
revealed the sunny-haired child standing beside him.If an angel had
come, the effect could not have been greater.Like all who are morbid, he
was largely under the dominion of imagination; and Johnnie, with her
fearless, gentle, commiserating eyes, had for him the potency of a
supernatural visitor.But the healthful, unconscious child had a better
power.Her words and touch brought saneness as well as hope.Alvord," she cried, "were you asleep?your fire is going
out, and your lamp is not lighted, and there is nothing ready for your
supper.What a queer man you are, for one who is so kind!Mamma said I
might come and spend a little of Christmas-eve with you, and bring my
gifts, and then that you would bring me home.I know how to fix up your
fire and light your lamp.and she bustled around, the embodiment of beautiful life.he said, taking her sweet face in his hands, and looking
into her clear eyes, "Heaven must have sent you.I was so lonely and sad
that I wished I had never lived."See what I've brought you,"
and she opened a book with the angels' song of "peace and good-will"
illustrated."Mamma says that whoever believes that ought to be happy,"
said the child."Yes, it's true for those who are like you and your mother."She leaned against him, and looked over his shoulder at the pictures.Alvord, mamma said the song was for you, too.Of course, mamma's
right.What else did He come for but to help people who are in trouble?I
read stories about Him every Sunday to mamma, and He was always helping
people who were in trouble, and who had done wrong.That's why we are
always glad on Christmas.You look at the book while I set your table."He did look at it till his eyes were blinded with tears, and like a sweet
refrain came the words.Half an hour later Leonard, with a kindly impulse, thought he would go to
take by the hand Johnnie's strange friend, and see how the little girl
was getting on.The scene within, as he passed the window, checked his
steps.Alvord's table, pouring tea for
him, chattering meanwhile with a child's freedom, and the hermit was
looking at her with such a smile on his haggard face as Leonard had never
seen there.He walked quietly home, deferring his call till the morrow,
feeling that Johnnie's spell must not be broken.Alvord put Johnnie down at her home, for he had
insisted on carrying her through the snow, and for the first time kissed
her, as he said:

"Good-by.You, to-night, have been like one of the angels that brought
the tidings of 'peace and good-will.'""I'm sorry for him, mamma!"said the little girl, after telling her
story, "for he's very lonely, and he's such a queer, nice man.Isn't it
funny that he should be so old, and yet not know why we keep Christmas?"Amy sang again the Christmas hymn that her own father and the father who
had adopted her had loved so many years before.Clifford, as he was fondly bidding her good-night, "how sweetly you have
fulfilled the hopes you raised one year ago!"Clifford had gone to her room, leaning on the arm of Gertrude.As
the invalid kissed her in parting, she said:

"You have beautiful eyes, my dear, and they have seen far more of the
world than mine, but, thank God, they are clear and true.Keep them so,
my child, that I may welcome you again to a better home than this."Once more "the old house stood silent and dark in the pallid landscape."The winds were hushed, as if the peace within had been breathed into the
very heart of Nature, and she, too, could rest in her wintry sleep.The
moon was obscured by a veil of clouds, and the outlines of the trees were
faint upon the snow.A shadowy form drew near; a man paused, and looked
upon the dwelling."If the angels' song could be heard anywhere to-night,
it should be over that home," Mr.Alvord murmured; but, even to his
morbid fancy, the deep silence of the night remained unbroken.He
returned to his home, and sat down in the firelight.A golden-haired
child again leaned upon his shoulder, and asked, "What else did He come
for but to help people who are in trouble, and who have done wrong?"Was it a voice deep in his own soul that was longing to
escape from evil?or was it a harmony far away in the sky, that whispered
of peace at last?That message from heaven is clearest where the need is
greatest.Hargrove's home was almost a palace, but its stately rooms were
desolate on Christmas-eve.He wandered restlessly through their
magnificence.He paid no heed to the costly furniture and costlier works
of art."Trurie was right," he muttered."What power have these things to
satisfy when the supreme need of the heart is unsatisfied?It seems as if
I could not sleep to-night without seeing her.There is no use in
disguising the truth that I'm losing her.Even on Christmas-eve she is
absent.It's late, and since I cannot see her, I'll see her gift;" and he
went to her room, where she had told him to look for her remembrance.To his surprise, he found that, according to her secret instructions, it
was lighted.He entered the dainty apartment, and saw the glow of autumn
leaves and the airy grace of ferns around the pictures and windows.He
started, for he almost saw herself, so true was the life-size and
lifelike portrait that smiled upon him.Beneath it were the words, "Merry
Christmas, papa!You have not lost me; you have only made me happy."The moon is again rising over old Storm King; the crystals that cover the
white fields and meadows are beginning to flash in its rays; the great
pine by the Clifford home is sighing and moaning.What heavy secret has
the old tree that it can sigh with such a group near as is now gathered
beneath it?Burt's black horse rears high as he reins him in, that
Gertrude may spring into the cutter, then speeds away like a shadow
through the moonlight Webb's steed is strong and quiet, like himself, and
as tireless.Amy steps to Webb's side, feeling it to be her place in very
truth.Sable Abram draws up next, with the great family sleigh, and in a
moment Alf is perched beside him.Then Leonard half smothers Johnnie and
Ned under the robes, and Maggie, about to pick her way through the snow,
finds herself taken up in strong arms, like one of the children, and is
with them.The chime of bells dies away in the distance.Wedding-bells
will be their echo.*       *       *       *       *

The merry Christmas-day has passed.Barkdale, and other friends have come and gone with their greetings;
the old people are left alone beside their cheery fire."Here we are, mother, all by ourselves, just as we were once before on
Christmas night, when you were as fair and blooming as Amy or Gertrude.Well, my dear, the long journey seems short to-night.I suppose the
reason is that you have been such good company.""Dear old father, the journey would have been long and weary indeed, had
I not had your strong arm to lean upon, and a love that didn't fade with
my roses.There is only one short journey before us now, father, and then
we shall know fully the meaning of the 'good tidings of great joy'
forever."May joy attend his footsteps here
    And crown him in a brighter sphere."_February_ 24.--Susie Daggett and I went to the hall this morning to
clean up.We sent back the dishes, not one broken, and disposed of
everything but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken away this
afternoon.We feel quite satisfied with the receipts so far, but the
expenses will be considerable.In _Ontario County Times_ of the following week we find this card of
thanks:

_February_ 28.--The Fair for the benefit of the Freedmen, held in the
Town Hall on Thursday and Friday of last week was eminently successful,
and the young ladies take this method of returning their sincere thanks
to the people of Canandaigua and vicinity for their generous
contributions and liberal patronage.It being the first public
enterprise in which the Society has ventured independently, the young
ladies were somewhat fearful of the result, but having met with such
generous responses from every quarter they feel assured that they need
never again doubt of success in any similar attempt so long as
Canandaigua contains so many large hearts and corresponding purses.But
our village cannot have all the praise this time.S. D. Backus of New
York City, for their very substantial aid, not only in gifts and
unstinted patronage, but for their invaluable labor in the decoration of
the hall and conduct of the Fair.But for them most of the manual labor
would have fallen upon the ladies.The thanks of the Society are
especially due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally with their
superior knowledge and older experience.W. P. Fiske for his
valuable services as cashier, and to Messrs.Daggett, Chapin and Hills
for services at the door; and to all the little boys and girls who
helped in so many ways.The receipts amounted to about $490, and thanks to our cashier, the
money is all good, and will soon be on its way carrying substantial
visions of something to eat and to wear to at least a few of the poor
Freedmen of the South.By order of Society,
                                            Carrie C. Richards, Pres't.Emma H. Wheeler, Sec'y.Editor--I expected to see an account of the Young Ladies' Fair in
your last number, but only saw a very handsome acknowledgment by the
ladies to the citizens.Your "local" must have been absent; and I beg
the privilege in behalf of myself and many others of doing tardy justice
to the successful efforts of the Aid Society at their debut February
22nd.Gotham furnished an artist and an architect, and the Society did the
rest.The decorations were in excellent taste, and so were the young
ladies.The skating pond was never in
better condition.On entering the hall I paused first before the table
of toys, fancy work and perfumery.Here was the President, and I hope I
shall be pardoned for saying that no President since the days of
Washington can compare with the President of this Society.Then I
visited a candy table, and hesitated a long time before deciding which I
would rather eat, the delicacies that were sold, or the charming
creatures who sold them.One delicious morsel, in a pink silk, was so
tempting that I seriously contemplated eating her with a
spoon--waterfall and all.[By the way, how do we know that the Romans
wore waterfalls?Because Marc Antony, in his funeral oration on Mr.Caesar, exclaimed, "O water fall was there, my countrymen!"]At this
point my attention was attracted by a fish pond.I tried my luck, caught
a whale, and seeing all my friends beginning to blubber, I determined to
visit the old woman who lived in a shoe.--She was very glad to see me.I
bought one of her children, which the Society can redeem for $1,000 in
smoking caps.The fried oysters were delicious; a great many of the bivalves got into
a stew, and I helped several of them out.Delicate ice cream, nicely
"baked in cowld ovens," was destroyed in immense quantities.I scream
when I remember the plates full I devoured, and the number of bright
women to whom I paid my devours.Beautiful cigar girls sold fragrant
Havanas, and bit off the ends at five cents apiece, extra.The fair
post-mistress and her fair clerks, so fair that they were almost
fairies, drove a very thriving business.--Let no man say hereafter that
the young ladies of Canandaigua are uneducated in all that makes women
lovely and useful.The
members of this Society have won the admiration of all their friends,
and especially of the most devoted of their servants,
                                                            Q. E. D.

If I had written that article, I should have given the praise to Susie
Daggett, for it belongs to her._Sunday, June_ 24.--My Sunday School scholars are learning the shorter
catechism.One recited thirty-five answers to questions to-day, another
twenty-six, another twenty, the others eleven.They do
not see why it is called the "shorter" Catechism!They all had their
ambrotypes taken with me yesterday at Finley's--Mary Hoyt, Fannie and
Ella Lyon, Ella Wood, Ella Van Tyne, Mary Vanderbrook, Jennie Whitlaw
and Katie Neu.They are all going to dress in white and sit on the front
seat in church at my wedding.Gooding make
individual fruit cakes for each of them and also some for each member of
our sewing society._Thursday, June_ 21.--We went to a lawn fete at Mrs.F. F. Thompson's
this afternoon.The flowers, the grounds, the
young people and the music all combined to make the occasion perfect._Note:_ Canandaigua is the summer home of Mrs.Thompson, who has
previously given the village a children's playground, a swimming school,
a hospital and a home for the aged, and this year (1911) has presented a
park as a beauty spot at foot of Canandaigua Lake._June_ 28.--Dear Abbie Clark and Captain Williams were married in the
Congregational church this evening.The church was trimmed beautifully
and Abbie looked sweet.We attended the reception afterwards at her
house."May calm and sunshine hallow their clasped hands."_July_ 15.--The girls of the Society have sent me my flag bed quilt,
which they have just finished.It was hard work quilting such hot days
but it is done beautifully.Bessie Seymour wrote the names on the stars.In the center they used six stars for "Three rousing cheers for the
Union."The names on the others are Sarah McCabe, Mary Paul, Fannie
Paul, Fannie Palmer, Nettie Palmer, Susie Daggett, Fannie Pierce, Sarah
Andrews, Lottie Clark, Abbie Williams, Carrie Lamport, Isadore Blodgett,
Nannie Corson, Laura Chapin, Mary F. Fiske, Lucilla F. Pratt, Jennie H.
Hazard, Sarah H. Foster, Mary Jewett, Mary C. Stevens, Etta Smith,
Cornelia Richards, Ella Hildreth, Emma Wheeler, Mary Wheeler, Mrs.Pierce, Alice Jewett, Bessie Seymour, Clara Coleman, Julia Phelps.It
kept the girls busy to get Abbie Clark's quilt and mine finished within
one month.They hope that the rest of the girls will postpone their
nuptials till there is a change in the weather.Mercury stands 90
degrees in the shade._July_ 19, 1866.--Our wedding day.We saw the dear little Grandmother,
God bless her, watching us from the window as we drove away.Alexandria Bay, _July_ 26.--Anna writes me that Charlie Wells said he
had always wanted a set of Clark's Commentaries, but I had carried off
the entire Ed._July_ 28.--As we were changing boats at Burlington, Vt, for Saratoga,
to our surprise, we met Captain and Abbie Williams, but could only stop
a moment.Saratoga, 29_th._--We heard Rev.Theodore Cuyler preach to-day from the
text, "Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world."He
leads devotional exercises every morning in the parlors of the Columbian
Hotel.I spoke to him this morning and he said my father was one of his
best and earliest friends.Canandaigua, _September_ 1.--A party of us went down to the Canandaigua
hotel this morning to see President Johnson, General Grant and Admiral
Farragut and other dignitaries.The train stopped about half an hour and
they all gave brief speeches.1867

_July_ 27.--Col.James M. Bull was buried from the home of Mr.Alexander
Howell to-day, as none of his family reside here now._November_ 13.--Our brother John and wife and baby Pearl have gone to
London, England, to live._December_ 28.--A large party of Canandaiguans went over to Rochester
last evening to hear Charles Dickens' lecture, and enjoyed it more than
I can possibly express.He was quite hoarse and had small bills
distributed through the Opera House with the announcement:

                    MR.CHARLES DICKENS

    Begs indulgence for a Severe Cold, but hopes its effects
    may not be very perceptible after a few minutes' Reading.We brought these notices home with us for souvenirs.It was worth a great deal just to look upon the man
who wrote Little Dorrit, David Copperfield and all the other books,
which have delighted us so much.We hope that he will live to write a
great many more.He spoke very appreciatively of his enthusiastic
reception in this country and almost apologized for some of the opinions
that he had expressed in his "American Notes," which he published, after
his first visit here, twenty-five years ago.He evidently thinks that
the United States of America are quite worth while.1871

_August_ 6.--Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A., Hon.George H. Stuart,
President of the U. S. Christian Commission, spoke in an open air
meeting on the square this afternoon and in our church this evening.The
house was packed and such eloquence I never heard from mortal lips.He
ought to be called the Whitefield of America.He told of the good the
Christian Commission had done before the war and since.They took up a collection which must have amounted to
hundreds of dollars.1872

_Naples, June._--John has invited Aunt Ann Field, and James, his wife
and me and Babe Abigail to come to England to make them a visit, and we
expect to sail on the Baltic July sixth.Baltic, July_ 7.--We left New York yesterday under
favorable circumstances.It was a beautiful summer day, flags were
flying and everything seemed so joyful we almost forgot we were leaving
home and native land.There were many passengers, among them being Mr.Anthony Drexel and U. S. Grant, Jr., who boarded the steamer
from a tug boat which came down the bay alongside when we had been out
half an hour.President Grant was with him and stood on deck, smoking
the proverbial cigar.We were glad to see him and the passengers gave
him three cheers and three times three, with the greatest enthusiasm._Liverpool, July_ 16.--We arrived here to-day, having been just ten days
on the voyage.There were many clergymen of note on board, among them,
Rev.John H. Vincent, D.D., eminent in the Methodist Episcopal Church,
who is preparing International Sunday School lessons.He sat at our
table and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic singer.They
held services both Sabbaths, July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the
steamer, and also in the steerage where the text was "And they willingly
received him into the ship."The immigrants listened eagerly, when the
minister urged them all to "receive Jesus."We enjoyed several evening
literary entertainments, when it was too cold or windy to sit on deck.We had the most luscious strawberries at dinner to-night, that I ever
ate.So large and red and ripe, with the hulls on and we dipped them in
powdered sugar as we ate them, a most appetizing way._London, July_ 17.--On our way to London to-day I noticed beautiful
flower beds at every station, making our journey almost a path of roses.In the fields, men and women both, were harvesting the hay, making
picturesque scenes, for the sky was cloudless and I was reminded of the
old hymn, commencing

    "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
    Stand dressed in living green."We performed the journey from Liverpool to London, a distance of 240
miles, in five hours.John, Laura and little Pearl met us at Euston
Station, and we were soon whirled away in cabs to 24 Upper Woburn Place,
Tavistock Square, John's residence.Dinner was soon ready, a most
bountiful repast.We spent the remainder of the day visiting and
enjoying ourselves generally.It seemed so good to be at the end of the
journey, although we had only two days of really unpleasant weather on
the voyage.John and Laura are so kind and hospitable.They have a
beautiful home, lovely children and apparently every comfort and luxury
which this world can afford._Sunday, July_ 22.--We went to Spurgeon's Tabernacle this morning to
listen to this great preacher, with thousands of others.I had never
looked upon such a sea of faces before, as I beheld from the gallery
where we sat.The pulpit was underneath one gallery, so there seemed as
many people over the preacher's head, as there were beneath and around
him and the singing was as impressive as the sermon.I thought of the
hymn, "Hark ten thousand harps and voices, Sound the notes of praise
above."Spurgeon was so lame from rheumatism that he used two canes
and placed one knee on a chair beside him, when preaching.His text was
"And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth."I found that all I
had heard of his eloquence was true._Sunday, July_ 29.--We have spent the entire week sightseeing, taking in
Hyde Park, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, St.Paul's Cathedral, the
Tower of London and British Museum.We also went to Madame Tussaud's
exhibition of wax figures and while I was looking in the catalogue for
the number of an old gentleman who was sitting down apparently asleep,
he got up and walked away!We drove to Sydenham ten miles from London,
to see the Crystal Palace which Abbie called the "Christmas Palace."Henry Chesebro of Canandaigua are here and came
to see us to-day._August_ 13.--Amid the whirl of visiting, shopping and sightseeing in
this great city, my diary has been well nigh forgotten.The descriptive
letters to home friends have been numerous and knowing that they would
be preserved, I thought perhaps they would do as well for future
reference as a diary kept for the same purpose, but to-day, as St.Pancras' bell was tolling and a funeral procession going by, we heard by
cable of the death of our dear, dear Grandmother, the one who first
encouraged us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who was always most
interested in all that interested us and now I cannot refrain if I
would, from writing down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in
my heart.She has only stepped inside the
temple-gate where she has long been waiting for the Lord's entrance
call.I weep for ourselves that we shall see her dear face no more.It
does not seem possible that we shall never see her again on this earth.She took such an interest in our journey and just as we started I put my
dear little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her parting
blessing.As we left the house she sat at the front window and saw us go
and smiled her farewell._August_ 20.--Anna has written how often Grandmother prayed that "He who
holds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hands,
would care for us and bring us to our desired haven."She had received
one letter, telling of our safe arrival and how much we enjoyed going
about London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.Anna's letter came, after ten days, telling us all
the sad news, and how Grandmother looked out of the window the last
night before she was taken ill, and up at the moon and stars and said
how beautiful they were.Anna says, "How can I ever write it?Our dear
little Grandmother died on my bed to-day."_August_ 30.--John, Laura and their nurse and baby John, Aunt Ann Field
and I started Tuesday on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow
where we remained twenty-four hours.We visited the Cathedral and were
about to go down into the crypt when the guide told us that Gen.Sherman
of U.S.A.We stopped to look at him and felt like
telling him that we too were Americans.He was in good health and
spirits, apparently, and looked every inch a soldier with his cloak
a-la-militaire around him.We visited the Lochs and spent one night at
Inversnaid on Loch Lomond and then went on up Loch Katrine to the
Trossachs.When we took the little steamer, John said, "All aboard for
Naples," it reminded him so much of Canandaigua Lake.We arrived safely
in Edinburgh the next day by rail and spent four days in that charming
city, so beautiful in situation and in every natural advantage.We saw
the window from whence John Knox addressed the populace and we also
visited the Castle on the hill.Then we went to Melrose and visited the
Abbey and also Abbotsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott.We went
through the rooms and saw many curios and paintings and also the
library.Sir Walter's chair at his desk was protected by a rope, but
Laura, nothing daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there for
a moment saying "I am sure, now, he will be clever."We continued our
journey that night and arrived in London the next morning._Ventnor, Isle of Wight, September_ 9.--Aunt Ann, Laura's sister,
Florentine Arnold, nurse and two children, Pearl and Abbie, and I are
here for three weeks on the seashore._September_ 16.--We have visited all the neighboring towns, the graves
of the Dairyman's daughter and little Jane, the young cottager, and the
scene of Leigh Richmond's life and labors.We have enjoyed bathing in
the surf, and the children playing in the sands and riding on the
donkeys.We have very pleasant rooms, in a house kept by an old couple, Mr.Tuddenham, down on the esplanade.They serve excellent meals in a
most homelike way.We have an abundance of delicious milk and cream
which they tell me comes from "Cowes"!_London, September_ 30.--Anna has come to England to live with John for
the present.She came on the Adriatic, arriving September 24.We are so
glad to see her once more and will do all in our power to cheer her in
her loneliness._Paris, October_ 18.--John, Laura, Aunt Ann and I, nurse and baby,
arrived here to-day for a few days' visit.We had rather a stormy
passage on the Channel.I asked one of the seamen the name of the vessel
and he answered me "The H'Albert H'Edward, Miss!"This information must
have given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till we reached
Calais, although nearly every one around me succumbed._October_ 22.--We have driven through the Bois de Boulogne, visited Pere
la Chaise, the Morgue, the ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just
as they were since the Commune.We spent half a day at the Louvre
without seeing half of its wonders.I went alone to a photographer's, Le
Jeune, to be "taken" and had a funny time.He queried "Parlez-vous
Francais?"I shook my head and asked him "Parlez-vous Anglaise?"at
which query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!I ventured to
tell him by signs that I would like my picture taken and he held up two
sizes of pictures and asked me "Le cabinet, le vignette?"I held up my
fingers, to tell him I would like six of each, whereupon he proceeded to
make ready and when he had seated me, he made me understand that he
hoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored to do.After the
first sitting, he showed displeasure and let me know that I had swayed
to and fro.Another attempt was more satisfactory and he said "Tres
bien, Madame," and I gave him my address and departed._October_ 26.--My photographs have come and all pronounce them indeed
"tres bien."We visited the Tomb of Napoleon to-day._October_ 27.--We attended service to-day at the American Chapel and I
enjoyed it more than I can ever express.After hearing a foreign tongue
for the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to go into a
Presbyterian church and hear a sermon from an American pastor.The
singing in the choir was so homelike, that when they sang "Awake my soul
to joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer's praise," it seemed to me
that I heard a well known tenor voice from across the sea, especially in
the refrain "His loving kindness, oh how free."The text was "As an
eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad
her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord did lead
him and there was no strange God with him."It was a
wonderful sermon and I shall never forget it.On our way home, we
noticed the usual traffic going on, building of houses, women were
standing in their doors knitting and there seemed to be no sign of
Sunday keeping, outside of the church._London, October_ 31.--John and I returned together from Paris and now I
have only a few days left before sailing for home.There was an
Englishman here to-day who was bragging about the beer in England being
so much better than could be made anywhere else.He said, "In America,
you have the 'ops, I know, but you haven't the Thames water, you know."_Sunday, November_ 3.--We went to hear Rev.He is a new light, comparatively, and bids fair to rival
Spurgeon and Newman Hall and all the rest.He is like a lion and again
like a lamb in the pulpit._Liverpool, November_ 6.--I came down to Liverpool to-day with Abbie and
nurse, to sail on the Baltic, to-morrow.There were two Englishmen in
our compartment and hearing Abbie sing "I have a Father in the Promised
Land," they asked her where her Father lived and she said "In America,"
and told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow to see him.Then
they turned to me and said they supposed I would be glad to know that
the latest cable from America was that U. S. Grant was elected for his
second term as President of the United States.I assured them that I was
very glad to hear such good news._November_ 9.--I did not know any of the passengers when we sailed, but
soon made pleasant acquaintances.Sykes from New York and in course of conversation I found that she as
well as myself, was born in Penn Yan, Yates County, New York, and that
her parents were members of my Father's church, which goes to prove that
the world is not so very wide after all.Abbie is a great pet among the
passengers and is being passed around from one to another from morning
till night.They love to hear her sing and coax her to say "Grace" at
table.She closes her eyes and folds her hands devoutly and says, "For
what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful."They
all say "Amen" to this, for they are fearful that they will not perhaps
be "thankful" when they finish!_November_ 15.--I have been on deck every day but one, and not missed a
single meal.There was a terrible storm one night and the next morning I
told one of the numerous clergymen, that I took great comfort in the
night, thinking that nothing could happen with so many of the Lord's
anointed, on board.He said that he wished he had thought of that, for
he was frightened almost to death!We have sighted eleven steamers and
on Wednesday we were in sight of the banks of Newfoundland all the
afternoon, our course being unusually northerly and we encountered no
fogs, contrary to the expectation of all.Every one pronounces the
voyage pleasant and speedy for this time of year._Naples, N. Y., November_ 20.--We arrived safely in New York on Sunday.Abbie spied her father very quickly upon the dock as we slowly came up
and with glad and happy hearts we returned his "Welcome home."We spent
two days in New York and arrived home safe and sound this evening._November_ 21.--My thirtieth birthday, which we, a reunited family, are
spending happily together around our own fireside, pleasant memories of
the past months adding to the joy of the hour.From the _New York Evangelist_ of August 15, 1872, by Rev."Died, at Canandaigua, N. Y., August 8, 1872, Mrs.Abigail Field Beals,
widow of Thomas Beals, in the 98th year of her age.Beals, whose
maiden name was Field, was born in Madison, Conn., April 7, 1784.David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,
and of Rev.Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational church of
Canandaigua.She came to Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq., with whom she lived
nearly sixty years, until he fell asleep.They had eleven children, of
whom only four survive.In 1807 she and her husband united with the
Congregational church, of which they were ever liberal and faithful
supporters.Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house in the
simple and substantial style of the past.She herself belonged to an age
of which she was the last.With great dignity and courtesy of manner
which repelled too much familiarity, she combined a sweet and winning
grace, which attracted all to her, so that the youth, while they would
almost involuntarily 'rise up before her,' yet loved to be in her
presence and called her blessed.She possessed in a rare degree the
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love
and peace.Her home and room were to her children and her children's
children what Jerusalem was to the saints of old.There they loved to
resort and the saddest thing in her death is the sundering of that tie
which bound so many generations together.She never ceased to take a
deep interest in the prosperity of the beautiful village of which she
and her husband were the pioneers and for which they did so much and in
the church of which she was the oldest member.Her mind retained its
activity to the last and her heart was warm in sympathy with every good
work.While she was well informed in all current events, she most
delighted in whatever concerned the Kingdom.Her Bible and religious
books were her constant companions and her conversation told much of her
better thoughts, which were in Heaven.Living so that those who knew her
never saw in her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently awaited
the Master's call and went down to her grave in a full age like a shock
of corn fully ripe that cometh in its season."I don't think I shall keep a diary any more, only occasionally jot down
things of importance.Noah T. Clarke's brother got possession of my
little diary in some way one day and when he returned it I found written
on the fly-leaf this inscription to the diary:

    "You'd scarce expect a volume of my size
    To hold so much that's beautiful and wise,
    And though the heartless world might call me cheap
    Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,
    And kindly shelter all who toil below,
    So my future greatness and the good I do
    Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few."I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes which I find upon
an old well-worn writing book which Anna used for jotting down her
youthful deeds.On the cover I find inscribed, "Try to be somebody," and
on the back of the same book, as if trying to console herself for
unexpected achievement which she could not prevent, "Some must be
great!"*       *       *       *       *




1880

_June_ 17.--Our dear Anna was married to-day to Mr.Alonzo A. Cummings
of Oakland, Cal., and has gone there to live.I am sorry to have her go
so far away, but love annihilates space.There is no real separation,
except in alienation of spirit, and that can never come--to us.THE END

THE HOME BOOK OF VERSE

_American and English_ (1580-1912)

Compiled by Burton E. Stevenson.Collects the best short poetry of the
English language--not only the poetry everybody says is good, but also
the verses that everybody reads.(3742 pages; India paper, 1 vol., 8vo,
complete author, title and first line indices, $7.50 net; carriage 40
cents extra.)The most comprehensive and representative collection of American and
English poetry ever published, including 3,120 unabridged poems from
some 1,100 authors.It brings together in one volume the best short poetry of the English
language from the time of Spencer, with especial attention to American
verse.The copyright deadline has been passed, and some three hundred recent
authors are included, very few of whom appear in any other general
anthology, such as Lionel Johnson, Noyes, Housman, Mrs.Meynell, Yeats,
Dobson, Lang, Watson, Wilde, Francis Thompson, Gilder, Le Gallienne, Van

With the first peep of day Henry awoke, and found the faithful Cuddie
standing beside him with a portmanteau in his hand."I hae been just putting your honour's things in readiness again ye were
waking," said Cuddie, "as is my duty, seeing ye hae been sae gude as to
tak me into your service.""I take you into my service, Cuddie?"said Morton, "you must be
dreaming.""Na, na, stir," answered Cuddie; "didna I say when I was tied on the
horse yonder, that if ever ye gat loose I would be your servant, and ye
didna say no?and if that isna hiring, I kenna what is.Ye gae me nae
arles, indeed, but ye had gien me eneugh before at Milnwood.""Well, Cuddie, if you insist on taking the chance of my unprosperous
fortunes"--

"Ou ay, I'se warrant us a' prosper weel eneugh," answered Cuddie,
cheeringly, "an anes my auld mither was weel putten up.I hae begun the
campaigning trade at an end that is easy eneugh to learn."said Morton, "for how else could you come by that
portmanteau?""I wotna if it's pillaging, or how ye ca't," said Cuddie, "but it comes
natural to a body, and it's a profitable trade.Our folk had tirled the
dead dragoons as bare as bawbees before we were loose amaist.--But when I
saw the Whigs a' weel yokit by the lugs to Kettledrummle and the other
chield, I set off at the lang trot on my ain errand and your honour's.Sae I took up the syke a wee bit, away to the right, where I saw the
marks o'mony a horsefoot, and sure eneugh I cam to a place where there
had been some clean leatherin', and a' the puir chields were lying there
buskit wi' their claes just as they had put them on that morning--naebody
had found out that pose o' carcages--and wha suld be in the midst thereof
(as my mither says) but our auld acquaintance, Sergeant Bothwell?""Troth has he," answered Cuddie; "and his een were open and his brow
bent, and his teeth clenched thegither, like the jaws of a trap for
foumarts when the spring's doun--I was amaist feared to look at him;
however, I thought to hae turn about wi' him, and sae I e'en riped his
pouches, as he had dune mony an honester man's; and here's your ain
siller again (or your uncle's, which is the same) that he got at Milnwood
that unlucky night that made us a' sodgers thegither.""There can be no harm, Cuddie," said Morton, "in making use of this
money, since we know how he came by it; but you must divide with me.""Bide a wee, bide a wee," said Cuddie."Weel, and there's a bit ring he
had hinging in a black ribbon doun on his breast.I am thinking it has
been a love-token, puir fallow--there's naebody sae rough but they hae
aye a kind heart to the lasses--and there's a book wi'a wheen papers, and
I got twa or three odd things, that I'll keep to mysell, forby.""Upon my word, you have made a very successful foray for a beginner,"
said his new master.said Cuddie, with great exultation."I tauld ye I
wasna that dooms stupid, if it cam to lifting things.--And forby, I hae
gotten twa gude horse.A feckless loon of a Straven weaver, that has left
his loom and his bein house to sit skirling on a cauld hill-side, had
catched twa dragoon naigs, and he could neither gar them hup nor wind,
sae he took a gowd noble for them baith--I suld hae tried him wi' half
the siller, but it's an unco ill place to get change in--Ye'll find the
siller's missing out o' Bothwell's purse.""You have made a most excellent and useful purchase, Cuddie; but what is
that portmanteau?"answered Cuddie, "it was Lord Evandale's yesterday, and
it's yours the day.I fand it ahint the bush o' broom yonder--ilka dog
has its day--Ye ken what the auld sang says,

          'Take turn about, mither, quo' Tam o' the Linn.'"And, speaking o' that, I maun gang and see about my mither, puir auld
body, if your honour hasna ony immediate commands.""But, Cuddie," said Morton, "I really cannot take these things from you
without some recompense.""Hout fie, stir," answered Cuddie, "ye suld aye be taking,--for
recompense, ye may think about that some other time--I hae seen gay weel
to mysell wi' some things that fit me better.What could I do wi' Lord
Evandale's braw claes?Sergeant Bothwell's will serve me weel eneugh."Not being able to prevail on the self-constituted and disinterested
follower to accept of any thing for himself out of these warlike spoils,
Morton resolved to take the first opportunity of returning Lord
Evandale's property, supposing him yet to be alive; and, in the
meanwhile, did not hesitate to avail himself of Cuddie's prize, so far as
to appropriate some changes of linen and other triffling articles amongst
those of more value which the portmanteau contained.He then hastily looked over the papers which were found in Bothwell's
pocket-book.The roll of his
troop, with the names of those absent on furlough, memorandums of
tavern-bills, and lists of delinquents who might be made subjects of fine
and persecution, first presented themselves, along with a copy of a
warrant from the Privy Council to arrest certain persons of distinction
therein named.In another pocket of the book were one or two commissions
which Bothwell had held at different times, and certificates of his
services abroad, in which his courage and military talents were highly
praised.But the most remarkable paper was an accurate account of his
genealogy, with reference to many documents for establishment of its
authenticity; subjoined was a list of the ample possessions of the
forfeited Earls of Bothwell, and a particular account of the proportions
in which King James VI.had bestowed them on the courtiers and nobility
by whose descendants they were at present actually possessed; beneath
this list was written, in red letters, in the hand of the deceased, Haud
Immemor, F. S. E. B. the initials probably intimating Francis Stewart,
Earl of Bothwell.To these documents, which strongly painted the
character and feelings of their deceased proprietor, were added some
which showed him in a light greatly different from that in which we have
hitherto presented him to the reader.In a secret pocket of the book, which Morton did not discover without
some trouble, were one or two letters, written in a beautiful female
hand.They were dated about twenty years back, bore no address, and were
subscribed only by initials.Without having time to peruse them
accurately, Morton perceived that they contained the elegant yet fond
expressions of female affection directed towards an object whose jealousy
they endeavoured to soothe, and of whose hasty, suspicious, and impatient
temper, the writer seemed gently to complain.The ink of these
manuscripts had faded by time, and, notwithstanding the great care which
had obviously been taken for their preservation, they were in one or two
places chafed so as to be illegible."It matters not," these words were written on the envelope of that which
had suffered most, "I have them by heart."With these letters was a lock of hair wrapped in a copy of verses,
written obviously with a feeling, which atoned, in Morton's opinion, for
the roughness of the poetry, and the conceits with which it abounded,
according to the taste of the period:

Thy hue, dear pledge, is pure and bright, As in that well-remember'd
night, When first thy mystic braid was wove, And first my Agnes whisper'd
love.Since then, how often hast thou press'd The torrid zone of this
wild breast, Whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell With the first sin
which peopled hell; A breast whose blood's a troubled ocean, Each throb
the earthquake's wild commotion!--O, if such clime thou canst endure, Yet
keep thy hue unstain'd and pure, What conquest o'er each erring thought
Of that fierce realm had Agnes wrought!I had not wander'd wild and wide,
With such an angel for my guide; Nor heaven nor earth could then reprove
me, If she had lived, and lived to love me.Not then this world's wild
joys had been To me one savage hunting-scene, My sole delight the
headlong race, And frantic hurry of the chase, To start, pursue, and
bring to bay, Rush in, drag down, and rend my prey, Then from the carcass
turn away; Mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed, And soothed each wound
which pride inflamed;--Yes, God and man might now approve me, If thou
hadst lived, and lived to love me!As he finished reading these lines, Morton could not forbear reflecting
with compassion on the fate of this singular and most unhappy being, who,
it appeared, while in the lowest state of degradation, and almost of
contempt, had his recollections continually fixed on the high station to
which his birth seemed to entitle him; and, while plunged in gross
licentiousness, was in secret looking back with bitter remorse to the
period of his youth, during which he had nourished a virtuous, though
unfortunate attachment.what are we," said Morton, "that our best and most praiseworthy
feelings can be thus debased and depraved--that honourable pride can sink
into haughty and desperate indifference for general opinion, and the
sorrow of blighted affection inhabit the same bosom which license,
revenge, and rapine, have chosen for their citadel?But it is the same
throughout; the liberal principles of one man sink into cold and
unfeeling indifference, the religious zeal of another hurries him into
frantic and savage enthusiasm.Our resolutions, our passions, are like
the waves of the sea, and, without the aid of Him who formed the human
breast, we cannot say to its tides, 'Thus far shall ye come, and no
farther."'While he thus moralized, he raised his eyes, and observed that Burley
stood before him.said that leader--"It is well, and shows zeal to tread
the path before you.--What papers are these?"Morton gave him some brief account of Cuddie's successful marauding
party, and handed him the pocket-book of Bothwell, with its contents.The
Cameronian leader looked with some attention on such of the papers as
related to military affairs, or public business; but when he came to the
verses, he threw them from him with contempt."I little thought," he said, "when, by the blessing of God, I passed my
sword three times through the body of that arch tool of cruelty and
persecution, that a character so desperate and so dangerous could have
stooped to an art as trifling as it is profane.But I see that Satan can
blend the most different qualities in his well-beloved and chosen agents,
and that the same hand which can wield a club or a slaughter-weapon
against the godly in the valley of destruction, can touch a tinkling
lute, or a gittern, to soothe the ears of the dancing daughters of
perdition in their Vanity Fair.""Your ideas of duty, then," said Morton, "exclude love of the fine arts,
which have been supposed in general to purify and to elevate the mind?""To me, young man," answered Burley, "and to those who think as I do, the
pleasures of this world, under whatever name disguised, are vanity, as
its grandeur and power are a snare.We have but one object on earth, and
that is to build up the temple of the Lord.""I have heard my father observe," replied Morton, "that many who assumed
power in the name of Heaven, were as severe in its exercise, and as
unwilling to part with it, as if they had been solely moved by the
motives of worldly ambition--But of this another time.Have you succeeded
in obtaining a committee of the council to be nominated?""The number is limited to six, of which you
are one, and I come to call you to their deliberations."Morton accompanied him to a sequestered grassplot, where their colleagues
awaited them.In this delegation of authority, the two principal factions
which divided the tumultuary army had each taken care to send three of
their own number.On the part of the Cameronians, were Burley, Macbriar,
and Kettledrummle; and on that of the moderate party, Poundtext, Henry
Morton, and a small proprietor, called the Laird of Langcale.Thus the
two parties were equally balanced by their representatives in the
committee of management, although it seemed likely that those of the most
violent opinions were, as is usual in such cases, to possess and exert
the greater degree of energy.Their debate, however, was conducted more
like men of this world than could have been expected from their conduct
on the preceding evening.After maturely considering their means and
situation, and the probable increase of their numbers, they agreed that
they would keep their position for that day, in order to refresh their
men, and give time to reinforcements to join them, and that, on the next
morning, they would direct their march towards Tillietudlem, and summon
that stronghold, as they expressed it, of malignancy.If it was not
surrendered to their summons, they resolved to try the effect of a brisk
assault; and, should that miscarry, it was settled that they should leave
a part of their number to blockade the place, and reduce it, if possible,
by famine, while their main body should march forward to drive
Claverhouse and Lord Ross from the town of Glasgow.Such was the
determination of the council of management; and thus Morton's first
enterprise in active life was likely to be the attack of a castle
belonging to the parent of his mistress, and defended by her relative,
Major Bellenden, to whom he personally owed many obligations!He felt
fully the embarrassment of his situation, yet consoled himself with the
reflection, that his newly-acquired power in the insurgent army would
give him, at all events, the means of extending to the inmates of
Tillietudlem a protection which no other circumstance could have afforded
them; and he was not without hope that he might be able to mediate such
an accommodation betwixt them and the presbyterian army, as should secure
them a safe neutrality during the war which was about to ensue.There came a knight from the field of slain,
               His steed was drench'd in blood and rain.We must now return to the fortress of Tillietudlem and its inhabitants.The morning, being the first after the battle of Loudon-hill, had dawned
upon its battlements, and the defenders had already resumed the labours
by which they proposed to render the place tenable, when the watchman,
who was placed in a high turret, called the Warder's Tower, gave the
signal that a horseman was approaching.As he came nearer, his dress
indicated an officer of the Life-Guards; and the slowness of his horse's
pace, as well as the manner in which the rider stooped on the saddle-bow,
plainly showed that he was sick or wounded.The wicket was instantly
opened to receive him, and Lord Evandale rode into the court-yard, so
reduced by loss of blood, that he was unable to dismount without
assistance.As he entered the hall, leaning upon a servant, the ladies
shrieked with surprise and terror; for, pale as death, stained with
blood, his regimentals soiled and torn, and his hair matted and
disordered, he resembled rather a spectre than a human being.But their
next exclamation was that of joy at his escape.exclaimed Lady Margaret, "that you are here, and have
escaped the hands of the bloodthirsty murderers who have cut off so many
of the king's loyal servants!"added Edith, "that you are here and in safety!But you are wounded, and I fear we have little the
means of assisting you.""My wounds are only sword-cuts," answered the young nobleman, as he
reposed himself on a seat; "the pain is not worth mentioning, and I
should not even feel exhausted but for the loss of blood.But it was not
my purpose to bring my weakness to add to your danger and distress, but
to relieve them, if possible.What can I do for you?--Permit me," he
added, addressing Lady Margaret--"permit me to think and act as your son,
my dear madam--as your brother, Edith!"He pronounced the last part of the sentence with some emphasis, as if he
feared that the apprehension of his pretensions as a suitor might render
his proffered services unacceptable to Miss Bellenden.She was not
insensible to his delicacy, but there was no time for exchange of
sentiments."We are preparing for our defence," said the old lady with great dignity;
"my brother has taken charge of our garrison, and, by the grace of God,
we will give the rebels such a reception as they deserve.""How gladly," said Evandale, "would I share in the defence of the Castle!But in my present state, I should be but a burden to you, nay, something
worse; for, the knowledge that an officer of the Life-Guards was in the
Castle would be sufficient to make these rogues more desperately earnest
to possess themselves of it.If they find it defended only by the family,
they may possibly march on to Glasgow rather than hazard an assault.""And can you think so meanly of us, my lord," said Edith, with the
generous burst of feeling which woman so often evinces, and which becomes
her so well, her voice faltering through eagerness, and her brow
colouring with the noble warmth which dictated her language--"Can you
think so meanly of your friends, as that they would permit such
considerations to interfere with their sheltering and protecting you at a
moment when you are unable to defend yourself, and when the whole country
is filled with the enemy?Is there a cottage in Scotland whose owners
would permit a valued friend to leave it in such circumstances?And can
you think we will allow you to go from a castle which we hold to be
strong enough for our own defence?""Lord Evandale need never think of it," said Lady Margaret."I will dress
his wounds myself; it is all an old wife is fit for in war time; but to
quit the Castle of Tillietudlem when the sword of the enemy is drawn to
slay him,--the meanest trooper that ever wore the king's coat on his back
should not do so, much less my young Lord Evandale.--Ours is not a house
that ought to brook such dishonour.The tower of Tillietudlem has been
too much distinguished by the visit of his most sacred"--

Here she was interrupted by the entrance of the Major."We have taken a prisoner, my dear uncle," said Edith--"a wounded
prisoner, and he wants to escape from us.You must help us to keep him by
force.""I am as much pleased as when I
got my first commission.Claverhouse reported you were killed, or missing
at least.""I should have been slain, but for a friend of yours," said Lord
Evandale, speaking with some emotion, and bending his eyes on the ground,
as if he wished to avoid seeing the impression that what he was about to
say would make upon Miss Bellenden."I was unhorsed and defenceless, and
the sword raised to dispatch me, when young Mr Morton, the prisoner for
whom you interested yourself yesterday morning, interposed in the most
generous manner, preserved my life, and furnished me with the means of
escaping."As he ended the sentence, a painful curiosity overcame his first
resolution; he raised his eyes to Edith's face, and imagined he could
read in the glow of her cheek and the sparkle of her eye, joy at hearing
of her lover's safety and freedom, and triumph at his not having been
left last in the race of generosity.Such, indeed, were her feelings; but
they were also mingled with admiration of the ready frankness with which
Lord Evandale had hastened to bear witness to the merit of a favoured
rival, and to acknowledge an obligation which, in all probability, he
would rather have owed to any other individual in the world.Major Bellenden, who would never have observed the emotions of either
party, even had they been much more markedly expressed, contented himself
with saying, "Since Henry Morton has influence with these rascals, I am
glad he has so exerted it; but I hope he will get clear of them as soon
as he can.I know his principles, and that he
detests their cant and hypocrisy.I have heard him laugh a thousand times
at the pedantry of that old presbyterian scoundrel, Poundtext, who, after
enjoying the indulgence of the government for so many years, has now,
upon the very first ruffle, shown himself in his own proper colours, and
set off, with three parts of his cropeared congregation, to join the host
of the fanatics.--But how did you escape after leaving the field, my
lord?""I rode for my life, as a recreant knight must," answered Lord Evandale,
smiling."I took the route where I thought I had least chance of meeting
with any of the enemy, and I found shelter for several hours--you will
hardly guess where.""At Castle Bracklan, perhaps," said Lady Margaret, "or in the house of
some other loyal gentleman?"I was repulsed, under one mean pretext or another, from more
than one house of that description, for fear of the enemy following my
traces; but I found refuge in the cottage of a poor widow, whose husband
had been shot within these three months by a party of our corps, and
whose two sons are at this very moment with the insurgents."said Lady Margaret Bellenden; "and was a fanatic woman capable
of such generosity?--but she disapproved, I suppose, of the tenets of her
family?""Far from it, madam," continued the young nobleman; "she was in principle
a rigid recusant, but she saw my danger and distress, considered me as a
fellow-creature, and forgot that I was a cavalier and a soldier.She
bound my wounds, and permitted me to rest upon her bed, concealed me from
a party of the insurgents who were seeking for stragglers, supplied me
with food, and did not suffer me to leave my place of refuge until she
had learned that I had every chance of getting to this tower without
danger.""It was nobly done," said Miss Bellenden; "and I trust you will have an
opportunity of rewarding her generosity.""I am running up an arrear of obligation on all sides, Miss Bellenden,
during these unfortunate occurrences," replied Lord Evandale; "but when I
can attain the means of showing my gratitude, the will shall not be
wanting."All now joined in pressing Lord Evandale to relinquish his intention of
leaving the Castle; but the argument of Major Bellenden proved the most
effectual."Your presence in the Castle will be most useful, if not absolutely
necessary, my lord, in order to maintain, by your authority, proper
discipline among the fellows whom Claverhouse has left in garrison here,
and who do not prove to be of the most orderly description of inmates;
and, indeed, we have the Colonel's authority, for that very purpose, to
detain any officer of his regiment who might pass this way.""That," said Lord Evandale, "is an unanswerable argument, since it shows
me that my residence here may be useful, even in my present disabled
state.""For your wounds, my lord," said the Major, "if my sister, Lady
Bellenden, will undertake to give battle to any feverish symptom, if such
should appear, I will answer that my old campaigner, Gideon Pike, shall
dress a flesh-wound with any of the incorporation of Barber-Surgeons.He
had enough of practice in Montrose's time, for we had few regularly-bred
army chirurgeons, as you may well suppose.--You agree to stay with us,
then?""My reasons for leaving the Castle," said Lord Evandale, glancing a look
towards Edith, "though they evidently seemed weighty, must needs give way
to those which infer the power of serving you.May I presume, Major, to
enquire into the means and plan of defence which you have prepared?or
can I attend you to examine the works?"It did not escape Miss Bellenden, that Lord Evandale seemed much
exhausted both in body and mind."I think, sir," she said, addressing the
Major, "that since Lord Evandale condescends to become an officer of our
garrison, you should begin by rendering him amenable to your authority,
and ordering him to his apartment, that he may take some refreshment ere
he enters on military discussions.""Edith is right," said the old lady; "you must go instantly to bed, my
lord, and take some febrifuge, which I will prepare with my own hand; and
my lady-in-waiting, Mistress Martha Weddell, shall make some friar's
chicken, or something very light.I would not advise wine.--John Gudyill,
let the housekeeper make ready the chamber of dais.Lord Evandale must
lie down instantly.Pike will take off the dressings, and examine the
state of the wounds.""These are melancholy preparations, madam," said Lord Evandale, as he
returned thanks to Lady Margaret, and was about to leave the hall,--"but
I must submit to your ladyship's directions; and I trust that your skill
will soon make me a more able defender of your castle than I am at
present.You must render my body serviceable as soon as you can, for you
have no use for my head while you have Major Bellenden.""An excellent young man, and a modest," said the Major."None of that conceit," said Lady Margaret, "that often makes young folk
suppose they know better how their complaints should be treated than
people that have had experience.""And so generous and handsome a young nobleman," said Jenny Dennison, who
had entered during the latter part of this conversation, and was now left
alone with her mistress in the hall, the Major returning to his military
cares, and Lady Margaret to her medical preparations.Edith only answered these encomiums with a sigh; but, although silent,
she felt and knew better than any one how much they were merited by the
person on whom they were bestowed.Jenny, however, failed not to follow
up her blow."After a', it's true that my lady says--there's nae trusting a
presbyterian; they are a' faithless man-sworn louns.Whae wad hae thought
that young Milnwood and Cuddie Headrigg wad hae taen on wi' thae rebel
blackguards?""What do you mean by such improbable nonsense, Jenny?"said her young
mistress, very much displeased."I ken it's no pleasing for you to hear, madam," answered Jenny hardily;
"and it's as little pleasant for me to tell; but as gude ye suld ken a'
about it sune as syne, for the haill Castle's ringing wi't.""Just that Henry Morton of Milnwood is out wi' the rebels, and ane o'
their chief leaders."said Edith--"a most base calumny!and you are very
bold to dare to repeat it to me.Henry Morton is incapable of such
treachery to his king and country--such cruelty to me--to--to all the
innocent and defenceless victims, I mean, who must suffer in a civil
war--I tell you he is utterly incapable of it, in every sense."Miss Edith," replied Jenny, still constant to her text,
"they maun be better acquainted wi' young men than I am, or ever wish to
be, that can tell preceesely what they're capable or no capable o'.But
there has been Trooper Tam, and another chield, out in bonnets and grey
plaids, like countrymen, to recon--reconnoitre--I think John Gudyill ca'd
it; and they hae been amang the rebels, and brought back word that they
had seen young Milnwood mounted on ane o' the dragoon horses that was
taen at Loudon-hill, armed wi' swords and pistols, like wha but him, and
hand and glove wi' the foremost o' them, and dreeling and commanding the
men; and Cuddie at the heels o' him, in ane o' Sergeant Bothwell's laced
waistcoats, and a cockit hat with a bab o' blue ribbands at it for the
auld cause o' the Covenant, (but Cuddie aye liked a blue ribband,) and a
ruffled sark, like ony lord o' the land--it sets the like o' him,
indeed!""Jenny," said her young mistress hastily, "it is impossible these men's
report can be true; my uncle has heard nothing of it at this instant.""Because Tam Halliday," answered the handmaiden, "came in just five
minutes after Lord Evandale; and when he heard his lordship was in the
Castle, he swore (the profane loon!)he would be d--d ere he would make
the report, as he ca'd it, of his news to Major Bellenden, since there
was an officer of his ain regiment in the garrison.Sae he wad have said
naething till Lord Evandale wakened the next morning; only he tauld me
about it," (here Jenny looked a little down,) "just to vex me about
Cuddie.""Poh, you silly girl," said Edith, assuming some courage, "it is all a
trick of that fellow to teaze you.""Na, madam, it canna be that, for John Gudyill took the other dragoon
(he's an auld hard-favoured man, I wotna his name) into the cellar, and
gae him a tass o' brandy to get the news out o' him, and he said just the
same as Tam Halliday, word for word; and Mr Gudyill was in sic a rage,
that he tauld it a' ower again to us, and says the haill rebellion is
owing to the nonsense o' my Leddy and the Major, and Lord Evandale, that
begged off young Milnwood and Cuddie yesterday morning, for that, if they
had suffered, the country wad hae been quiet--and troth I am muckle o'
that opinion mysell."This last commentary Jenny added to her tale, in resentment of her
mistress's extreme and obstinate incredulity.She was instantly alarmed,
however, by the effect which her news produced upon her young lady, an
effect rendered doubly violent by the High-church principles and
prejudices in which Miss Bellenden had been educated.Her complexion
became as pale as a corpse, her respiration so difficult that it was on
the point of altogether failing her, and her limbs so incapable of
supporting her, that she sunk, rather than sat, down upon one of the
seats in the hall, and seemed on the eve of fainting.Jenny tried cold
water, burnt feathers, cutting of laces, and all other remedies usual in
hysterical cases, but without any immediate effect.said the repentant fille-de-chambre."I
wish my tongue had been cuttit out!--Wha wad hae thought o' her taking on
that way, and a' for a young lad?--O, Miss Edith--dear Miss Edith, haud
your heart up about it, it's maybe no true for a' that I hae said--O, I
wish my mouth had been blistered!A' body tells me my tongue will do me a
mischief some day.or the Major?--and she's
sitting in the throne, too, that naebody has sate in since that weary
morning the King was here!--O, what will I do!O, what will become o'
us!"While Jenny Dennison thus lamented herself and her mistress, Edith slowly
returned from the paroxysm into which she had been thrown by this
unexpected intelligence."If he had been unfortunate," she said, "I never would have deserted him.I never did so, even when there was danger and disgrace in pleading his
cause.If he had died, I would have mourned him--if he had been
unfaithful, I would have forgiven him; but a rebel to his King,--a
traitor to his country,--the associate and colleague of cut-throats and
common stabbers,--the persecutor of all that is noble,--the professed and
blasphemous enemy of all that is sacred,--I will tear him from my heart,
if my life-blood should ebb in the effort!"She wiped her eyes, and rose hastily from the great chair, (or throne, as
Lady Margaret used to call it,) while the terrified damsel hastened to
shake up the cushion, and efface the appearance of any one having
occupied that sacred seat; although King Charles himself, considering the
youth and beauty as well as the affliction of the momentary usurper of
his hallowed chair, would probably have thought very little of the
profanation.She then hastened officiously to press her support on Edith,
as she paced the hall apparently in deep meditation."Tak my arm, madam; better just tak my arm; sorrow maun hae its vent, and
doubtless"--

"No, Jenny," said Edith, with firmness; "you have seen my weakness, and
you shall see my strength.""But ye leaned on me the other morning.Miss Edith, when ye were sae sair
grieved.""Misplaced and erring affection may require support, Jenny--duty can
support itself; yet I will do nothing rashly.I will be aware of the
reasons of his conduct--and then--cast him off for ever," was the firm
and determined answer of her young lady.Overawed by a manner of which she could neither conceive the motive, nor
estimate the merit, Jenny muttered between her teeth, "Odd, when the
first flight's ower, Miss Edith taks it as easy as I do, and muckle
easier, and I'm sure I ne'er cared half sae muckle about Cuddie Headrigg
as she did about young Milnwood.Forby that, it's maybe as weel to hae a
friend on baith sides; for, if the whigs suld come to tak the Castle, as
it's like they may, when there's sae little victual, and the dragoons
wasting what's o't, ou, in that case, Milnwood and Cuddie wad hae the
upper hand, and their freendship wad be worth siller--I was thinking sae
this morning or I heard the news."With this consolatory reflection the damsel went about her usual
occupations, leaving her mistress to school her mind as she best might,
for eradicating the sentiments which she had hitherto entertained towards
Henry Morton.Once more into the breach--dear friends, once more!Henry V.

On the evening of this day, all the information which they could procure
led them to expect, that the insurgent army would be with early dawn on
their march against Tillietudlem.Lord Evandale's wounds had been
examined by Pike, who reported them in a very promising state.They were
numerous, but none of any consequence; and the loss of blood, as much
perhaps as the boasted specific of Lady Margaret, had prevented any
tendency to fever; so that, notwithstanding he felt some pain and great
weakness, the patient maintained that he was able to creep about with the
assistance of a stick.In these circumstances he refused to be confined
to his apartment, both that he might encourage the soldiers by his
presence, and suggest any necessary addition to the plan of defence,
which the Major might be supposed to have arranged upon something of an
antiquated fashion of warfare.Lord Evandale was well qualified to give
advice on such subjects, having served, during his early youth, both in
France and in the Low Countries.There was little or no occasion,
however, for altering the preparations already made; and, excepting on
the article of provisions, there seemed no reason to fear for the defence
of so strong a place against such assailants as those by whom it was
threatened.With the peep of day, Lord Evandale and Major Bellenden were on the
battlements again, viewing and re-viewing the state of their
preparations, and anxiously expecting the approach of the enemy.I ought
to observe, that the report of the spies had now been regularly made and
received; but the Major treated the report that Morton was in arms
against the government with the most scornful incredulity."I know the lad better," was the only reply he deigned to make; "the
fellows have not dared to venture near enough, and have been deceived by
some fanciful resemblance, or have picked up some story.""I differ from you, Major," answered Lord Evandale; "I think you will see
that young gentleman at the head of the insurgents; and, though I shall
be heartily sorry for it, I shall not be greatly surprised.""You are as bad as Claverhouse," said the Major, "who contended yesterday
morning down my very throat, that this young fellow, who is as
high-spirited and gentleman-like a boy as I have ever known, wanted but
an opportunity to place himself at the head of the rebels.""And considering the usage which he has received, and the suspicions
under which he lies," said Lord Evandale, "what other course is open to
him?For my own part, I should hardly know whether he deserved most blame
or pity.""Blame, my lord?--Pity!"echoed the Major, astonished at hearing such
sentiments; "he would deserve to be hanged, that's all; and, were he my
own son, I should see him strung up with pleasure--Blame, indeed!But
your lordship cannot think as you are pleased to speak?""I give you my honour, Major Bellenden, that I have been for some time of
opinion, that our politicians and prelates have driven matters to a
painful extremity in this country, and have alienated, by violence of
various kinds, not only the lower classes, but all those in the upper
ranks, whom strong party-feeling, or a desire of court-interest, does not
attach to their standard.""I am no politician," answered the Major, "and I do not understand nice
distinctions.My sword is the King's, and when he commands, I draw it in
his cause.""I trust," replied the young lord, "you will not find me more backward
than yourself, though I heartily wish that the enemy were foreigners.It
is, however, no time to debate that matter, for yonder they come, and we
must defend ourselves as well as we can."As Lord Evandale spoke, the van of the insurgents began to make their
appearance on the road which crossed the top of the hill, and thence
descended opposite to the Tower.They did not, however, move downwards,
as if aware that, in doing so, their columns would be exposed to the fire
of the artillery of the place.But their numbers, which at first seemed
few, appeared presently so to deepen and concentrate themselves, that,
judging of the masses which occupied the road behind the hill from the
closeness of the front which they presented on the top of it, their force
appeared very considerable.There was a pause of anxiety on both sides;
and, while the unsteady ranks of the Covenanters were agitated, as if by
pressure behind, or uncertainty as to their next movement, their arms,
picturesque from their variety, glanced in the morning sun, whose beams
were reflected from a grove of pikes, muskets, halberds, and battle-axes.The armed mass occupied, for a few minutes, this fluctuating position,
until three or four horsemen, who seemed to be leaders, advanced from the
front, and occupied the height a little nearer to the Castle.John
Gudyill, who was not without some skill as an artilleryman, brought a gun
to bear on this detached group."I'll flee the falcon,"--(so the small cannon was called,)--"I'll flee
the falcon whene'er your honour gies command; my certie, she'll ruffle
their feathers for them!""Stay a moment," said the young nobleman, "they send us a flag of truce."In fact, one of the horsemen at that moment dismounted, and, displaying a
white cloth on a pike, moved forward towards the Tower, while the Major
and Lord Evandale, descending from the battlement of the main fortress,
advanced to meet him as far as the barricade, judging it unwise to admit
him within the precincts which they designed to defend.At the same time
that the ambassador set forth, the group of horsemen, as if they had
anticipated the preparations of John Gudyill for their annoyance,
withdrew from the advanced station which they had occupied, and fell back
to the main body.The envoy of the Covenanters, to judge by his mien and manner, seemed
fully imbued with that spiritual pride which distinguished his sect.His
features were drawn up to a contemptuous primness, and his half-shut eyes
seemed to scorn to look upon the terrestial objects around, while, at
every solemn stride, his toes were pointed outwards with an air that
appeared to despise the ground on which they trode.Lord Evandale could
not suppress a smile at this singular figure."Did you ever," said he to Major Bellenden, "see such an absurd
automaton?One would swear it moves upon springs--Can it speak, think
you?""O, ay," said the Major; "that seems to be one of my old acquaintance, a
genuine puritan of the right pharisaical leaven.--Stay--he coughs and
hems; he is about to summon the Castle with the but-end of a sermon,
instead of a parley on the trumpet."The veteran, who in his day had had many an opportunity to become
acquainted with the manners of these religionists, was not far mistaken
in his conjecture; only that, instead of a prose exordium, the Laird of
Langcale--for it was no less a personage--uplifted, with a Stentorian
voice, a verse of the twenty-fourth Psalm:

"Ye gates lift up your heads!ye doors, Doors that do last for aye, Be
lifted up"--

"I told you so," said the Major to Evandale, and then presented himself
at the entrance of the barricade, demanding to know for what purpose or
intent he made that doleful noise, like a hog in a high wind, beneath the
gates of the Castle."I come," replied the ambassador, in a high and shrill voice, and without
any of the usual salutations or deferences,--"I come from the godly army
of the Solemn League and Covenant, to speak with two carnal malignants,
William Maxwell, called Lord Evandale, and Miles Bellenden of Charnwood.""And what have you to say to Miles Bellenden and Lord Evandale?"said the Laird of Langcale, in the same sharp,
conceited, disrespectful tone of voice."Even so, for fault of better," said the Major."Then there is the public summons," said the envoy, putting a paper into
Lord Evandale's hand, "and there is a private letter for Miles Bellenden
from a godly youth, who is honoured with leading a part of our host.Read
them quickly, and God give you grace to fructify by the contents, though
it is muckle to be doubted."The summons ran thus: "We, the named and constituted leaders of the
gentlemen, ministers, and others, presently in arms for the cause of
liberty and true religion, do warn and summon William Lord Evandale and
Miles Bellenden of Charnwood, and others presently in arms, and keeping
garrison in the Tower of Tillietudlem, to surrender the said Tower upon
fair conditions of quarter, and license to depart with bag and baggage,
otherwise to suffer such extremity of fire and sword as belong by the
laws of war to those who hold out an untenable post.And so may God
defend his own good cause!"This summons was signed by John Balfour of Burley, as quarter-master
general of the army of the Covenant, for himself, and in name of the
other leaders.The letter to Major Bellenden was from Henry Morton.It was couched in
the following language:

"I have taken a step, my venerable friend, which, among many painful
consequences, will, I am afraid, incur your very decided disapprobation.But I have taken my resolution in honour and good faith, and with the
full approval of my own conscience.I can no longer submit to have my own
rights and those of my fellow-subjects trampled upon, our freedom
violated, our persons insulted, and our blood spilt, without just cause
or legal trial.Providence, through the violence of the oppressors
themselves, seems now to have opened a way of deliverance from this
intolerable tyranny, and I do not hold him deserving of the name and
rights of a freeman, who, thinking as I do, shall withold his arm from
the cause of his country.But God, who knows my heart, be my witness,
that I do not share the angry or violent passions of the oppressed and
harassed sufferers with whom I am now acting.My most earnest and anxious
desire is, to see this unnatural war brought to a speedy end, by the
union of the good, wise, and moderate of all parties, and a peace
restored, which, without injury to the King's constitutional rights, may
substitute the authority of equal laws to that of military violence, and,
permitting to all men to worship God according to their own consciences,
may subdue fanatical enthusiasm by reason and mildness, instead of
driving it to frenzy by persecution and intolerance."With these sentiments, you may conceive with what pain I appear in arms
before the house of your venerable relative, which we understand you
propose to hold out against us.Permit me to press upon you the
assurance, that such a measure will only lead to the effusion of
blood--that, if repulsed in the assault, we are yet strong enough to
invest the place, and reduce it by hunger, being aware of your
indifferent preparations to sustain a protracted siege.It would grieve
me to the heart to think what would be the sufferings in such a case,
and upon whom they would chiefly fall."Do not suppose, my respected friend, that I would propose to you any
terms which could compromise the high and honourable character which you
have so deservedly won, and so long borne.If the regular soldiers (to
whom I will ensure a safe retreat) are dismissed from the place, I trust
no more will be required than your parole to remain neuter during this
unhappy contest; and I will take care that Lady Margaret's property, as
well as yours, shall be duly respected, and no garrison intruded upon
you.I could say much in favour of this proposal; but I fear, as I must
in the present instance appear criminal in your eyes, good arguments
would lose their influence when coming from an unwelcome quarter.I will,
therefore, break off with assuring you, that whatever your sentiments may
be hereafter towards me, my sense of gratitude to you can never be
diminished or erased; and it would be the happiest moment of my life that
should give me more effectual means than mere words to assure you of it.Therefore, although in the first moment of resentment you may reject the
proposal I make to you, let not that prevent you from resuming the topic,
if future events should render it more acceptable; for whenever, or
howsoever, I can be of service to you, it will always afford the greatest
satisfaction to
                                     "Henry Morton."Having read this long letter with the most marked indignation, Major
Bellenden put it into the hands of Lord Evandale."I would not have believed this," he said, "of Henry Morton, if half
mankind had sworn it!rebellious in
cold blood, and without even the pretext of enthusiasm, that warms the
liver of such a crack-brained <DW2> as our friend the envoy there.But I
should have remembered he was a presbyterian--I ought to have been aware
that I was nursing a wolf-cub, whose diabolical nature would make him
tear and snatch at me on the first opportunity.Were Saint Paul on earth
again, and a presbyterian, he would be a rebel in three months--it is in
the very blood of them.""Well," said Lord Evandale, "I will be the last to recommend surrender;
but, if our provisions fail, and we receive no relief from Edinburgh or
Glasgow, I think we ought to avail ourselves of this opening, to get the
ladies, at least, safe out of the Castle.""They will endure all, ere they would accept the protection of such a
smooth-tongued hypocrite," answered the Major indignantly; "I would
renounce them for relatives were it otherwise.But let us dismiss the
worthy ambassador.--My friend," he said, turning to Langcale, "tell your
leaders, and the mob they have gathered yonder, that, if they have not a
particular opinion of the hardness of their own skulls, I would advise
them to beware how they knock them against these old walls.And let them
send no more flags of truce, or we will hang up the messenger in
retaliation of the murder of Cornet Grahame."With this answer the ambassador returned to those by whom he had been
sent.He had no sooner reached the main body than a murmur was heard
amongst the multitude, and there was raised in front of their ranks an
ample red flag, the borders of which were edged with blue.As the signal
of war and defiance spread out its large folds upon the morning wind, the
ancient banner of Lady Margaret's family, together with the royal ensign,
were immediately hoisted on the walls of the Tower, and at the same time,
a round of artillery was discharged against the foremost ranks of the
insurgents, by which they sustained some loss.Their leaders instantly
withdrew them to the shelter of the brow of the hill."I think," said John Gudyill, while he busied himself in re-charging his
guns, "they hae fund the falcon's neb a bit ower hard for them--It's no
for nought that the hawk whistles."But as he uttered these words, the ridge was once more crowded with the
ranks of the enemy.A general discharge of their fire-arms was directed
against the defenders upon the battlements.Under cover of the smoke, a
column of picked men rushed down the road with determined courage, and,
sustaining with firmness a heavy fire from the garrison, they forced
their way, in spite of opposition, to the first barricade by which the
avenue was defended.They were led on by Balfour in person, who displayed
courage equal to his enthusiasm; and, in spite of every opposition,
forced the barricade, killing and wounding several of the defenders, and
compelling the rest to retreat to their second position.The precautions,
however, of Major Bellenden rendered this success unavailing; for no
sooner were the Covenanters in possession of the post, than a close and
destructive fire was poured into it from the Castle, and from those
stations which commanded it in the rear.Having no means of protecting
themselves from this fire, or of returning it with effect against men who
were under cover of their barricades and defences, the Covenanters were
obliged to retreat; but not until they had, with their axes, destroyed
the stockade, so as to render it impossible for the defenders to
re-occupy it.Balfour was the last man that retired.He even remained for a short space
almost alone, with an axe in his hand, labouring like a pioneer amid the
storm of balls, many of which were specially aimed against him.The
retreat of the party he commanded was not effected without heavy loss,
and served as a severe lesson concerning the local advantages possessed
by the garrison.The next attack of the Covenanters was made with more caution.A strong
party of marksmen, (many of them competitors at the game of the
popinjay,) under the command of Henry Morton, glided through the woods
where they afforded them the best shelter, and, avoiding the open road,
endeavoured, by forcing their way through the bushes and trees, and up
the rocks which surrounded it on either side, to gain a position, from
which, without being exposed in an intolerable degree, they might annoy
the flank of the second barricade, while it was menaced in front by a
second attack from Burley.The besieged saw the danger of this movement,
and endeavoured to impede the approach of the marksmen, by firing upon
them at every point where they showed themselves.The assailants, on the
other hand, displayed great coolness, spirit, and judgment, in the manner
in which they approached the defences.This was, in a great measure, to
be ascribed to the steady and adroit manner in which they were conducted
by their youthful leader, who showed as much skill in protecting his own
followers as spirit in annnoying the enemy.He repeatedly enjoined his marksmen to direct their aim chiefly upon the
red-coats, and to save the others engaged in the defence of the Castle;
and, above all, to spare the life of the old Major, whose anxiety made
him more than once expose himself in a manner, that, without such
generosity on the part of the enemy, might have proved fatal.A dropping
fire of musketry now glanced from every part of the precipitous mount on
which the Castle was founded.From bush to bush--from crag to crag--from
tree to tree, the marksmen continued to advance, availing themselves of
branches and roots to assist their ascent, and contending at once with
the disadvantages of the ground and the fire of the enemy.At length they
got so high on the ascent, that several of them possessed an opportunity
of firing into the barricade against the defenders, who then lay exposed
to their aim, and Burley, profiting by the confusion of the moment, moved
forward to the attack in front.His onset was made with the same
desperation and fury as before, and met with less resistance, the
defenders being alarmed at the progress which the sharp-shooters had made
in turning the flank of their position.Determined to improve his
advantage, Burley, with his axe in his hand, pursued the party whom he
had dislodged even to the third and last barricade, and entered it along
with them."Kill, kill--down with the enemies of God and his people!--No
quarter--The Castle is ours!"were the cries by which he animated his
friends; the most undaunted of whom followed him close, whilst the
others, with axes, spades, and other implements, threw up earth, cut
down trees, hastily labouring to establish such a defensive cover in the
rear of the second barricade as might enable them to retain possession
of it, in case the Castle was not carried by this coup-de-main.Lord Evandale could no longer restrain his impatience.He charged with a
few soldiers who had been kept in reserve in the court-yard of the
Castle; and, although his arm was in a sling, encouraged them, by voice
and gesture, to assist their companions who were engaged with Burley.The
combat now assumed an air of desperation.The narrow road was crowded
with the followers of Burley, who pressed forward to support their
companions.The soldiers, animated by the voice and presence of Lord
Evandale, fought with fury, their small numbers being in some measure
compensated by their greater skill, and by their possessing the upper
ground, which they defended desperately with pikes and halberds, as well
as with the but of the carabines and their broadswords.Those within the
Castle endeavoured to assist their companions, whenever they could so
level their guns as to fire upon the enemy without endangering their
friends.The sharp-shooters, dispersed around, were firing incessantly on
each object that was exposed upon the battlement.The Castle was
enveloped with smoke, and the rocks rang to the cries of the combatants.In the midst of this scene of confusion, a singular accident had nearly
given the besiegers possession of the fortress.Cuddie Headrigg, who had advanced among the marksmen, being well
acquainted with every rock and bush in the vicinity of the Castle, where
he had so often gathered nuts with Jenny Dennison, was enabled, by such
local knowledge, to advance farther, and with less danger, than most of
his companions, excepting some three or four who had followed him close.Now Cuddie, though a brave enough fellow upon the whole, was by no means
fond of danger, either for its own sake, or for that of the glory which
attends it.In his advance, therefore, he had not, as the phrase goes,
taken the bull by the horns, or advanced in front of the enemy's fire.On
the contrary, he had edged gradually away from the scene of action, and,
turning his line of ascent rather to the left, had pursued it until it
brought him under a front of the Castle different from that before which
the parties were engaged, and to which the defenders had given no
attention, trusting to the steepness of the precipice.There was,
however, on this point, a certain window belonging to a certain pantry,
and communicating with a certain yew-tree, which grew out of a steep
cleft of the rock, being the very pass through which Goose Gibbie was
smuggled out of the Castle in order to carry Edith's express to
Charnwood, and which had probably, in its day, been used for other
contraband purposes.Cuddie, resting upon the but of his gun, and looking
up at this window, observed to one of his companions,--"There's a place I
ken weel; mony a time I hae helped Jenny Dennison out o' the winnock,
forby creeping in whiles mysell to get some daffin, at e'en after the
pleugh was loosed.""And what's to hinder us to creep in just now?"said the other, who was a
smart enterprising young fellow."There's no muckle to hinder us, an that were a'," answered Cuddie; "but
what were we to do neist?""We'll take the Castle," cried the other; "here are five or six o' us,
and a' the sodgers are engaged at the gate.""Come awa wi' you, then," said Cuddie; "but mind, deil a finger ye maun
lay on Lady Margaret, or Miss Edith, or the auld Major, or, aboon a', on
Jenny Dennison, or ony body but the sodgers--cut and quarter amang them
as ye like, I carena.""Ay, ay," said the other, "let us once in, and we will make our ain terms
with them a'."Gingerly, and as if treading upon eggs, Cuddie began to ascend the
well-known pass, not very willingly; for, besides that he was something
apprehensive of the reception he might meet with in the inside, his
conscience insisted that he was making but a shabby requital for Lady
Margaret's former favours and protection.He got up, however, into the
yew-tree, followed by his companions, one after another.The window was
small, and had been secured by stancheons of iron; but these had been
long worn away by time, or forced out by the domestics to possess a free
passage for their own occasional convenience.Entrance was therefore
easy, providing there was no one in the pantry, a point which Cuddie
endeavoured to discover before he made the final and perilous step.While
his companions, therefore, were urging and threatening him behind, and he
was hesitating and stretching his neck to look into the apartment, his
head became visible to Jenny Dennison, who had ensconced herself in said
pantry as the safest place in which to wait the issue of the assault.So
soon as this object of terror caught her eye, she set up a hysteric
scream, flew to the adjacent kitchen, and, in the desperate agony of
fear, seized on a pot of kailbrose which she herself had hung on the fire
before the combat began, having promised to Tam Halliday to prepare his
breakfast for him.Thus burdened, she returned to the window of the
pantry, and still exclaiming, "Murder!murder!--we are a' harried and
ravished--the Castle's taen--tak it amang ye!"she discharged the whole
scalding contents of the pot, accompanied with a dismal yell, upon the
person of the unfortunate Cuddie.However welcome the mess might have
been, if Cuddie and it had become acquainted in a regular manner, the
effects, as administered by Jenny, would probably have cured him of
soldiering for ever, had he been looking upwards when it was thrown upon
him.But, fortunately for our man of war, he had taken the alarm upon
Jenny's first scream, and was in the act of looking down, expostulating
with his comrades, who impeded the retreat which he was anxious to
commence; so that the steel cap and buff coat which formerly belonged to
Sergeant Bothwell, being garments of an excellent endurance, protected
his person against the greater part of the scalding brose.Enough,
however, reached him to annoy him severely, so that in the pain and
surprise he jumped hastily out of the tree, oversetting his followers, to
the manifest danger of their limbs, and, without listening to arguments,
entreaties, or authority, made the best of his way by the most safe road
to the main body of the army whereunto he belonged, and could neither by
threats nor persuasion be prevailed upon to return to the attack.[Illustration: Jenny Dennison--050]


As for Jenny, when she had thus conferred upon one admirer's outward man
the viands which her fair hands had so lately been in the act of
preparing for the stomach of another, she continued her song of alarm,
running a screaming division upon all those crimes, which the lawyers
call the four pleas of the crown, namely, murder, fire, rape, and
robbery.These hideous exclamations gave so much alarm, and created such
confusion within the Castle, that Major Bellenden and Lord Evandale
judged it best to draw off from the conflict without the gates, and,
abandoning to the enemy all the exterior defences of the avenue, confine
themselves to the Castle itself, for fear of its being surprised on some
unguarded point.Their retreat was unmolested; for the panic of Cuddie
and his companions had occasioned nearly as much confusion on the side
of the besiegers, as the screams of Jenny had caused to the defenders.There was no attempt on either side to renew the action that day.The
insurgents had suffered most severely; and, from the difficulty which
they had experienced in carrying the barricadoed positions without the
precincts of the Castle, they could have but little hope of storming the
place itself.On the other hand, the situation of the besieged was
dispiriting and gloomy.In the skirmishing they had lost two or three
men, and had several wounded; and though their loss was in proportion
greatly less than that of the enemy, who had left twenty men dead on the
place, yet their small number could much worse spare it, while the
desperate attacks of the opposite party plainly showed how serious the
leaders were in the purpose of reducing the place, and how well seconded
by the zeal of their followers.But, especially, the garrison had to fear
for hunger, in case blockade should be resorted to as the means of
reducing them.The Major's directions had been imperfectly obeyed in
regard to laying in provisions; and the dragoons, in spite of all warning
and authority, were likely to be wasteful in using them.It was,
therefore, with a heavy heart, that Major Bellenden gave directions for
guarding the window through which the Castle had so nearly been
surprised, as well as all others which offered the most remote facility
for such an enterprise.CHAPTER V.

               The King hath drawn
               The special head of all the land together.The leaders of the presbyterian army had a serious consultation upon the
evening of the day in which they had made the attack on Tillietudlem.They could not but observe that their followers were disheartened by the
loss which they had sustained, and which, as usual in such cases, had
fallen upon the bravest and most forward.It was to be feared, that if
they were suffered to exhaust their zeal and efforts in an object so
secondary as the capture of this petty fort, their numbers would melt
away by degrees, and they would lose all the advantages arising out of
the present unprepared state of the government.Moved by these arguments,
it was agreed that the main body of the army should march against
Glasgow, and dislodge the soldiers who were lying in that town.The
council nominated Henry Morton, with others, to this last service, and
appointed Burley to the command of a chosen body of five hundred men, who
were to remain behind, for the purpose of blockading the Tower of
Tillietudlem.Morton testified the greatest repugnance to this
arrangement."He had the strongest personal motives," he said, "for desiring to remain
near Tillietudlem; and if the management of the siege were committed to
him, he had little doubt but that he would bring it to such an
accommodation, as, without being rigorous to the besieged, would fully
answer the purpose of the besiegers."Burley readily guessed the cause of his young colleague's reluctance to
move with the army; for, interested as he was in appreciating the
characters with whom he had to deal, he had contrived, through the
simplicity of Cuddie, and the enthusiasm of old Mause, to get much
information concerning Morton's relations with the family of
Tillietudlem.He therefore took the advantage of Poundtext's arising to
speak to business, as he said, for some short space of time, (which
Burley rightly interpreted to mean an hour at the very least), and seized
that moment to withdraw Morton from the hearing of their colleagues, and
to hold the following argument with him:

"Thou art unwise, Henry Morton, to desire to sacrifice this holy cause to
thy friendship for an uncircumcised Philistine, or thy lust for a
Moabitish woman.""I neither understand your meaning, Mr Balfour, nor relish your
allusions," replied Morton, indignantly; "and I know no reason you have
to bring so gross a charge, or to use such uncivil language.""Confess, however, the truth," said Balfour, "and own that there are
those within yon dark Tower, over whom thou wouldst rather be watching
like a mother over her little ones, than thou wouldst bear the banner of
the Church of Scotland over the necks of her enemies.""If you mean, that I would willingly terminate this war without any
bloody victory, and that I am more anxious to do this than to acquire any
personal fame or power, you may be," replied Morton, "perfectly right.""And not wholly wrong," answered Burley, "in deeming that thou wouldst
not exclude from so general a pacification thy friends in the garrison of
Tillietudlem.""Certainly," replied Morton; "I am too much obliged to Major Bellenden
not to wish to be of service to him, as far as the interest of the cause
I have espoused will permit.I never made a secret of my regard for him.""I am aware of that," said Burley; "but, if thou hadst concealed it, I
should, nevertheless, have found out thy riddle.Now, hearken to my
words.This Miles Bellenden hath means to subsist his garrison for a
month.""This is not the case," answered Morton; "we know his stores are hardly
equal to a week's consumption.""Ay, but," continued Burley, "I have since had proof, of the strongest
nature, that such a report was spread in the garrison by that wily and
grey-headed malignant, partly to prevail on the soldiers to submit to a
diminution of their daily food, partly to detain us before the walls of
his fortress until the sword should be whetted to smite and destroy us.""And why was not the evidence of this laid before the council of war?""Why need we undeceive Kettledrummle,
Macbriar, Poundtext, and Langcale, upon such a point?Thyself must own,
that whatever is told to them escapes to the host out of the mouth of the
preachers at their next holding-forth.They are already discouraged by
the thoughts of lying before the fort a week.What would be the
consequence were they ordered to prepare for the leaguer of a month?""But why conceal it, then, from me?and, above
all, what proofs have you got of the fact?""There are many proofs," replied Burley; and he put into his hands a
number of requisitions sent forth by Major Bellenden, with receipts on
the back to various proprietors, for cattle, corn, meal, to such an
amount, that the sum total seemed to exclude the possibility of the
garrison being soon distressed for provisions.But Burley did not inform
Morton of a fact which he himself knew full well, namely, that most of
these provisions never reached the garrison, owing to the rapacity of the
dragoons sent to collect them, who readily sold to one man what they took
from another, and abused the Major's press for stores, pretty much as Sir
John Falstaff did that of the King for men."And now," continued Balfour, observing that he had made the desired
impression, "I have only to say, that I concealed this from thee no
longer than it was concealed from myself, for I have only received these
papers this morning; and I tell it unto thee now, that thou mayest go on
thy way rejoicing, and work the great work willingly at Glasgow, being
assured that no evil can befall thy friends in the malignant party, since
their fort is abundantly victualled, and I possess not numbers sufficient
to do more against them than to prevent their sallying forth.""And why," continued Morton, who felt an inexpressible reluctance to
acquiesce in Balfour's reasoning--"why not permit me to remain in the
command of this smaller party, and march forward yourself to Glasgow?"And therefore, young man," answered Burley, "have I laboured that it
should be committed to the son of Silas Morton.I am waxing old, and this
grey head has had enough of honour where it could be gathered by danger.I speak not of the frothy bubble which men call earthly fame, but the
honour belonging to him that doth not the work negligently.But thy
career is yet to run.Thou hast to vindicate the high trust which has
been bestowed on thee through my assurance that it was dearly
well-merited.At Loudon-hill thou wert a captive, and at the last assault
it was thy part to fight under cover, whilst I led the more open and
dangerous attack; and, shouldst thou now remain before these walls when
there is active service elsewhere, trust me, that men will say, that the
son of Silas Morton hath fallen away from the paths of his father."Stung by this last observation, to which, as a gentleman and soldier, he
could offer no suitable reply, Morton hastily acquiesced in the proposed
arrangement.Yet he was unable to divest himself of certain feelings of
distrust which he involuntarily attached to the quarter from which he
received this information."Mr Balfour," he said, "let us distinctly understand each other.You have
thought it worth your while to bestow particular attention upon my
private affairs and personal attachments; be so good as to understand,
that I am as constant to them as to my political principles.It is
possible, that, during my absence, you may possess the power of soothing
or of wounding those feelings.Be assured, that whatever may be the
consequences to the issue of our present adventure, my eternal gratitude,
or my persevering resentment, will attend the line of conduct you may
adopt on such an occasion; and, however young and inexperienced I am, I
have no doubt of finding friends to assist me in expressing my sentiments
in either case.""If there be a threat implied in that denunciation," replied Burley,
coldly and haughtily, "it had better have been spared.I know how to
value the regard of my friends, and despise, from my soul, the threats of
my enemies.Whatever happens
here in your absence shall be managed with as much deference to your
wishes, as the duty I owe to a higher power can possibly permit."With this qualified promise Morton was obliged to rest satisfied."Our defeat will relieve the garrison," said he, internally, "ere they
can be reduced to surrender at discretion; and, in case of victory, I
already see, from the numbers of the moderate party, that I shall have a
voice as powerful as Burley's in determining the use which shall be made
of it."He therefore followed Balfour to the council, where they found
Kettledrummle adding to his lastly a few words of practical application.When these were expended, Morton testified his willingness to accompany
the main body of the army, which was destined to drive the regular troops
from Glasgow.His companions in command were named, and the whole
received a strengthening exhortation from the preachers who were present.Next morning, at break of day, the insurgent army broke up from their
encampment, and marched towards Glasgow.It is not our intention to detail at length incidents which may be found
in the history of the period.It is sufficient to say, that Claverhouse
and Lord Ross, learning the superior force which was directed against
them, intrenched, or rather barricadoed themselves, in the centre of the
city, where the town-house and old jail were situated, with the
determination to stand the assault of the insurgents rather than to
abandon the capital of the west of Scotland.The presbyterians made their
attack in two bodies, one of which penetrated into the city in the line
of the College and Cathedral Church, while the other marched up the
Gallowgate, or principal access from the south-east.Both divisions were
led by men of resolution, and behaved with great spirit.But the
advantages of military skill and situation were too great for their
undisciplined valour.Ross and Claverhouse had carefully disposed parties of their soldiers in
houses, at the heads of the streets, and in the entrances of closes, as
they are called, or lanes, besides those who were intrenched behind
breast-works which reached across the streets.The assailants found their
ranks thinned by a fire from invisible opponents, which they had no means
of returning with effect.It was in vain that Morton and other leaders
exposed their persons with the utmost gallantry, and endeavoured to bring
their antagonists to a close action; their followers shrunk from them in
every direction.And yet, though Henry Morton was one of the very last to
retire, and exerted himself in bringing up the rear, maintaining order in
the retreat, and checking every attempt which the enemy made to improve
the advantage they had gained by the repulse, he had still the
mortification to hear many of those in his ranks muttering to each other,
that "this came of trusting to latitudinarian boys; and that, had honest,
faithful Burley led the attack, as he did that of the barricades of
Tillietudlem, the issue would have been as different as might be."It was with burning resentment that Morton heard these reflections thrown
out by the very men who had soonest exhibited signs of discouragement.The unjust reproach, however, had the effect of firing his emulation, and
making him sensible that, engaged as he was in a perilous cause, it was
absolutely necessary that he should conquer or die."I have no retreat," he said to himself."All shall allow--even Major
Bellenden--even Edith--that in courage, at least, the rebel Morton was
not inferior to his father."The condition of the army after the repulse was so undisciplined, and in
such disorganization, that the leaders thought it prudent to draw off
some miles from the city to gain time for reducing them once more into
such order as they were capable of adopting.Recruits, in the meanwhile,
came fast in, more moved by the extreme hardships of their own condition,
and encouraged by the advantage obtained at Loudon-hill, than deterred by
the last unfortunate enterprise.Many of these attached themselves
particularly to Morton's division.He had, however, the mortification to
see that his unpopularity among the more intolerant part of the
Covenanters increased rapidly.The prudence beyond his years, which he
exhibited in improving the discipline and arrangement of his followers,
they termed a trusting in the arm of flesh, and his avowed tolerance for
those of religious sentiments and observances different from his own,
obtained him, most unjustly, the nickname of Gallio, who cared for none
of those things.What was worse than these misconceptions, the mob of the
insurgents, always loudest in applause of those who push political or
religious opinions to extremity, and disgusted with such as endeavour to
reduce them to the yoke of discipline, preferred avowedly the more
zealous leaders, in whose ranks enthusiasm in the cause supplied the want
of good order and military subjection, to the restraints which Morton
endeavoured to bring them under.In short, while bearing the principal
burden of command, (for his colleagues willingly relinquished in his
favour every thing that was troublesome and obnoxious in the office of
general,) Morton found himself without that authority, which alone could
render his regulations effectual.[Note: These feuds, which tore to
pieces the little army of insurgents, turned merely on the point whether
the king's interest or royal authority was to be owned or not, and
whether the party in arms were to be contented with a free exercise of
their own religion, or insist upon the re-establishment of Presbytery in
its supreme authority, and with full power to predominate over all other
forms of worship.The few country gentlemen who joined the insurrection,
with the most sensible part of the clergy, thought it best to limit their
demands to what it might be possible to attain.But the party who urged
these moderate views were termed by the more zealous bigots, the Erastian
party, men, namely, who were willing to place the church under the
influence of the civil government, and therefore they accounted them, "a
snare upon Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."See the Life of Sir
Robert Hamilton in the Scottish Worthies, and his account of the Battle
of Both-well-bridge, passim.]Yet, notwithstanding these obstacles, he had, during the course of a few
days, laboured so hard to introduce some degree of discipline into the
army, that he thought he might hazard a second attack upon Glasgow with
every prospect of success.It cannot be doubted that Morton's anxiety to measure himself with
Colonel Grahame of Claverhouse, at whose hands he had sustained such
injury, had its share in giving motive to his uncommon exertions.But
Claverhouse disappointed his hopes; for, satisfied with having the
advantage in repulsing the first attack upon Glasgow, he determined that
he would not, with the handful of troops under his command, await a
second assault from the insurgents, with more numerous and better
disciplined forces than had supported their first enterprise.He
therefore evacuated the place, and marched at the head of his troops
towards Edinburgh.The insurgents of course entered Glasgow without
resistance, and without Morton having the opportunity, which he so deeply
coveted, of again encountering Claverhouse personally.But, although he
had not an opportunity of wiping away the disgrace which had befallen his
division of the army of the Covenant, the retreat of Claverhouse, and the
possession of Glasgow, tended greatly to animate the insurgent army, and
to increase its numbers.The necessity of appointing new officers, of
organizing new regiments and squadrons, of making them acquainted with at
least the most necessary points of military discipline, were labours,
which, by universal consent, seemed to be devolved upon Henry Morton, and
which he the more readily undertook, because his father had made him
acquainted with the theory of the military art, and because he plainly
saw, that, unless he took this ungracious but absolutely necessary
labour, it was vain to expect any other to engage in it.In the meanwhile, fortune appeared to favour the enterprise of the
insurgents more than the most sanguine durst have expected.The Privy
Council of Scotland, astonished at the extent of resistance which their
arbitrary measures had provoked, seemed stupified with terror, and
incapable of taking active steps to subdue the resentment which these
measures had excited.There were but very few troops in Scotland, and
these they drew towards Edinburgh, as if to form an army for protection
of the metropolis.The feudal array of the crown vassals in the various
counties, was ordered to take the field, and render to the King the
military service due for their fiefs.But the summons was very slackly
obeyed.The quarrel was not generally popular among the gentry; and even
those who were not unwilling themselves to have taken arms, were deterred
by the repugnance of their wives, mothers, and sisters, to their engaging
in such a cause.Meanwhile, the inadequacy of the Scottish government to provide for their
own defence, or to put down a rebellion of which the commencement seemed
so trifling, excited at the English court doubts at once of their
capacity, and of the prudence of the severities they had exerted against
the oppressed presbyterians.It was, therefore, resolved to nominate to
the command of the army of Scotland, the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth,
who had by marriage a great interest, large estate, and a numerous
following, as it was called, in the southern parts of that kingdom.The
military skill which he had displayed on different occasions abroad, was
supposed more than adequate to subdue the insurgents in the field; while
it was expected that his mild temper, and the favourable disposition
which he showed to presbyterians in general, might soften men's minds,
and tend to reconcile them to the government.The Duke was, therefore,
invested with a commission, containing high powers for settling the
distracted affairs of Scotland, and dispatched from London with strong
succours to take the principal military command in that country.I am bound to Bothwell-hill,
                    Where I maun either do or die.[Illustration: The Battle of Bothwell Bridge--128


There was now a pause in the military movements on both sides.The
government seemed contented to prevent the rebels advancing towards the
capital, while the insurgents were intent upon augmenting and
strengthening their forces.For this purpose, they established a sort of
encampment in the park belonging to the ducal residence at Hamilton, a
centrical situation for receiving their recruits, and where they were
secured from any sudden attack, by having the Clyde, a deep and rapid
river, in front of their position, which is only passable by a long and
narrow bridge, near the castle and village of Bothwell.Morton remained here for about a fortnight after the attack on Glasgow,
actively engaged in his military duties.He had received more than one
communication from Burley, but they only stated, in general, that the
Castle of Tillietudlem continued to hold out.Impatient of suspense upon
this most interesting subject, he at length intimated to his colleagues
in command his desire, or rather his intention,--for he saw no reason why
he should not assume a license which was taken by every one else in this
disorderly army,--to go to Milnwood for a day or two to arrange some
private affairs of consequence.The proposal was by no means approved of;
for the military council of the insurgents were sufficiently sensible of
the value of his services to fear to lose them, and felt somewhat
conscious of their own inability to supply his place.They could not,
however, pretend to dictate to him laws more rigid than they submitted to
themselves, and he was suffered to depart on his journey without any
direct objection being stated.The Reverend Mr Poundtext took the same
opportunity to pay a visit to his own residence in the neighbourhood of
Milnwood, and favoured Morton with his company on the journey.As the
country was chiefly friendly to their cause, and in possession of their
detached parties, excepting here and there the stronghold of some old
cavaliering Baron, they travelled without any other attendant than the
faithful Cuddie.It was near sunset when they reached Milnwood, where Poundtext bid adieu
to his companions, and travelled forward alone to his own manse, which
was situated half a mile's march beyond Tillietudlem.When Morton was
left alone to his own reflections, with what a complication of feelings
did he review the woods, banks, and fields, that had been familiar to
him!His character, as well as his habits, thoughts, and occupations, had
been entirely changed within the space of little more than a fortnight,
and twenty days seemed to have done upon him the work of as many years.A
mild, romantic, gentle-tempered youth, bred up in dependence, and
stooping patiently to the control of a sordid and tyrannical relation,
had suddenly, by the rod of oppression and the spur of injured feeling,
been compelled to stand forth a leader of armed men, was earnestly
engaged in affairs of a public nature, had friends to animate and enemies
to contend with, and felt his individual fate bound up in that of a
national insurrection and revolution.It seemed as if he had at once
experienced a transition from the romantic dreams of youth to the labours
and cares of active manhood.All that had formerly interested him was
obliterated from his memory, excepting only his attachment to Edith; and
even his love seemed to have assumed a character more manly and
disinterested, as it had become mingled and contrasted with other duties
and feelings.As he revolved the particulars of this sudden change, the
circumstances in which it originated, and the possible consequences of
his present career, the thrill of natural anxiety which passed along his
mind was immediately banished by a glow of generous and high-spirited
confidence."I shall fall young," he said, "if fall I must, my motives misconstrued,
and my actions condemned, by those whose approbation is dearest to me.But the sword of liberty and patriotism is in my hand, and I will neither
fall meanly nor unavenged.They may expose my body, and gibbet my limbs;
but other days will come, when the sentence of infamy will recoil against
those who may pronounce it.And that Heaven, whose name is so often
profaned during this unnatural war, will bear witness to the purity of
the motives by which I have been guided."Upon approaching Milnwood, Henry's knock upon the gate no longer
intimated the conscious timidity of a stripling who has been out of
bounds, but the confidence of a man in full possession of his own rights,
and master of his own actions,--bold, free, and decided.The door was
cautiously opened by his old acquaintance, Mrs Alison Wilson, who started
back when she saw the steel cap and nodding plume of the martial visitor."In troth, ye
garr'd my heart loup to my very mouth--But it canna be your ainsell, for
ye look taller and mair manly-like than ye used to do.""It is, however, my own self," said Henry, sighing and smiling at the
same time; "I believe this dress may make me look taller, and these
times, Ailie, make men out of boys."echoed the old woman; "and O that you suld be
endangered wi'them!but wha can help it?--ye were ill eneugh guided, and,
as I tell your uncle, if ye tread on a worm it will turn.""You were always my advocate, Ailie," said he, and the housekeeper no
longer resented the familiar epithet, "and would let no one blame me but
yourself, I am aware of that,--Where is my uncle?""In Edinburgh," replied Alison; "the honest man thought it was best to
gang and sit by the chimley when the reek rase--a vex'd man he's been and
a feared--but ye ken the Laird as weel as I do.""I hope he has suffered nothing in health?""Naething to speak of," answered the housekeeper, "nor in gudes
neither--we fended as weel as we could; and, though the troopers of
Tillietudlem took the red cow and auld Hackie, (ye'll mind them weel;)
yet they sauld us a gude bargain o' four they were driving to the
Castle.""Ou, they cam out to gather marts for the garrison," answered the
housekeeper; "but they just fell to their auld trade, and rade through
the country couping and selling a' that they gat, like sae mony
west-country drovers.My certie, Major Bellenden was laird o' the least
share o' what they lifted, though it was taen in his name.""Then," said Morton, hastily, "the garrison must be straitened for
provisions?""Stressed eneugh," replied Ailie--"there's little doubt o' that.""Burley must have deceived me--craft as well as cruelty is permitted by
his creed."Such was his inward thought; he said aloud, "I cannot stay,
Mrs Wilson, I must go forward directly."bide to eat a mouthfu'," entreated the affectionate
housekeeper, "and I'll mak it ready for you as I used to do afore thae
sad days," "It is impossible," answered Morton.--"Cuddie, get our horses
ready.""They're just eating their corn," answered the attendant.exclaimed Ailie; "what garr'd ye bring that ill-faur'd, unlucky
loon alang wi' ye?--It was him and his randie mother began a' the
mischief in this house.""Tut, tut," replied Cuddie, "ye should forget and forgie, mistress.Mither's in Glasgow wi' her tittie, and sall plague ye nae mair; and I'm
the Captain's wallie now, and I keep him tighter in thack and rape than
ever ye did;--saw ye him ever sae weel put on as he is now?""In troth and that's true," said the old housekeeper, looking with great
complacency at her young master, whose mien she thought much improved by
his dress."I'm sure ye ne'er had a laced cravat like that when ye were
at Milnwood; that's nane o' my sewing.""Na, na, mistress," replied Cuddie, "that's a cast o' my hand--that's ane
o' Lord Evandale's braws."answered the old lady, "that's him that the whigs are
gaun to hang the morn, as I hear say.""The whigs about to hang Lord Evandale?"said Morton, in the greatest
surprise."Ay, troth are they," said the housekeeper."Yesterday night he made a
sally, as they ca't, (my mother's name was Sally--I wonder they gie
Christian folk's names to sic unchristian doings,)--but he made an
outbreak to get provisions, and his men were driven back and he was taen,
'an' the whig Captain Balfour garr'd set up a gallows, and swore, (or
said upon his conscience, for they winna swear,) that if the garrison was
not gien ower the morn by daybreak, he would hing up the young lord, poor
thing, as high as Haman.--These are sair times!--but folk canna help
them--sae do ye sit down and tak bread and cheese until better meat's
made ready.Ye suldna hae kend a word about it, an I had thought it was
to spoil your dinner, hinny.""Fed, or unfed," exclaimed Morton, "saddle the horses instantly, Cuddie.We must not rest until we get before the Castle."And, resisting all Ailie's entreaties, they instantly resumed their
journey.Morton failed not to halt at the dwelling of Poundtext, and summon him to
attend him to the camp.That honest divine had just resumed for an
instant his pacific habits, and was perusing an ancient theological
treatise, with a pipe in his mouth, and a small jug of ale beside him, to
assist his digestion of the argument.It was with bitter ill-will that he
relinquished these comforts (which he called his studies) in order to
recommence a hard ride upon a high-trotting horse.However, when he knew
the matter in hand, he gave up, with a deep groan, the prospect of
spending a quiet evening in his own little parlour; for he entirely
agreed with Morton, that whatever interest Burley might have in rendering
the breach between the presbyterians and the government irreconcilable,
by putting the young nobleman to death, it was by no means that of the
moderate party to permit such an act of atrocity.And it is but doing
justice to Mr Poundtext to add, that, like most of his own persuasion, he
was decidedly adverse to any such acts of unnecessary violence; besides,
that his own present feelings induced him to listen with much complacence
to the probability held out by Morton, of Lord Evandale's becoming a
mediator for the establishment of peace upon fair and moderate terms.With this similarity of views, they hastened their journey, and arrived
about eleven o'clock at night at a small hamlet adjacent to the Castle at
Tillietudlem, where Burley had established his head-quarters.They were challenged by the sentinel, who made his melancholy walk at the
entrance of the hamlet, and admitted upon declaring their names and
authority in the army.Another soldier kept watch before a house, which
they conjectured to be the place of Lord Evandale's confinement, for a
gibbet of such great height as to be visible from the battlements of the
Castle, was erected before it, in melancholy confirmation of the truth of
Mrs Wilson's report.[Note: The Cameronians had suffered persecution, but
it was without learning mercy.We are informed by Captain Crichton, that
they had set up in their camp a huge gibbet, or gallows, having many
hooks upon it, with a coil of new ropes lying beside it, for the
execution of such royalists as they might make prisoners.Guild, in his
Bellum Bothuellianum, describes this machine particularly.]Morton
instantly demanded to speak with Burley, and was directed to his
quarters.They found him reading the Scriptures, with his arms lying
beside him, as if ready for any sudden alarm.He started upon the
entrance of his colleagues in office."Is there bad news
from the army?""No," replied Morton; "but we understand that there are measures adopted
here in which the safety of the army is deeply concerned--Lord Evandale
is your prisoner?""The Lord," replied Burley, "hath delivered him into our hands.""And you will avail yourself of that advantage, granted you by Heaven, to
dishonour our cause in the eyes of all the world, by putting a prisoner
to an ignominious death?""If the house of Tillietudlem be not surrendered by daybreak," replied
Burley, "God do so to me and more also, if he shall not die that death to
which his leader and patron, John Grahame of Claverhouse, hath put so
many of God's saints.""We are in arms," replied Morton, "to put down such cruelties, and not to
imitate them, far less to avenge upon the innocent the acts of the
guilty.By what law can you justify the atrocity you would commit?""If thou art ignorant of it," replied Burley, "thy companion is well
aware of the law which gave the men of Jericho to the sword of Joshua,
the son of Nun.""But we," answered the divine, "live under a better dispensation, which
instructeth us to return good for evil, and to pray for those who
despitefully use us and persecute us.""That is to say," said Burley, "that thou wilt join thy grey hairs to his
green youth to controvert me in this matter?""We are," rejoined Poundtext, "two of those to whom, jointly with
thyself, authority is delegated over this host, and we will not permit
thee to hurt a hair of the prisoner's head.It may please God to make him
a means of healing these unhappy breaches in our Israel.""I judged it would come to this," answered Burley, "when such as thou
wert called into the council of the elders."answered Poundtext,--"And who am I, that you should name me
with such scorn?--Have I not kept the flock of this sheep-fold from the
wolves for thirty years?Ay, even while thou, John Balfour, wert fighting
in the ranks of uncircumcision, a Philistine of hardened brow and bloody
hand--Who am I, say'st thou?""I will tell thee what thou art, since thou wouldst so fain know," said
Burley."Thou art one of those, who would reap where thou hast not sowed,
and divide the spoil while others fight the battle--thou art one of those
that follow the gospel for the loaves and for the fishes--that love their
own manse better than the Church of God, and that would rather draw their
stipends under prelatists or heathens, than be a partaker with those
noble spirits who have cast all behind them for the sake of the
Covenant.""And I will tell thee, John Balfour," returned Poundtext, deservedly
incensed, "I will tell thee what thou art.Thou art one of those, for
whose bloody and merciless disposition a reproach is flung upon the whole
church of this suffering kingdom, and for whose violence and
blood-guiltiness, it is to be feared, this fair attempt to recover our
civil and religious rights will never be honoured by Providence with the
desired success.""Gentlemen," said Morton, "cease this irritating and unavailing
recrimination; and do you, Mr Balfour, inform us, whether it is your
purpose to oppose the liberation of Lord Evandale, which appears to us a
profitable measure in the present position of our affairs?""You are here," answered Burley, "as two voices against one; but you will
not refuse to tarry until the united council shall decide upon this
matter?""This," said Morton, "we would not decline, if we could trust the hands
in whom we are to leave the prisoner.--But you know well," he added,
looking sternly at Burley, "that you have already deceived me in this
matter.""Go to," said Burley, disdainfully,--"thou art an idle inconsiderate boy,
who, for the black eyebrows of a silly girl, would barter thy own faith
and honour, and the cause of God and of thy country.""Mr Balfour," said Morton, laying his hand on his sword, "this language
requires satisfaction.""And thou shalt have it, stripling, when and where thou darest," said
Burley; "I plight thee my good word on it."Poundtext, in his turn, interfered to remind them of the madness of
quarrelling, and effected with difficulty a sort of sullen
reconciliation."Concerning the prisoner," said Burley, "deal with him as ye think fit.I
wash my hands free from all consequences.He is my prisoner, made by my
sword and spear, while you, Mr Morton, were playing the adjutant at
drills and parades, and you, Mr Poundtext, were warping the Scriptures
into Erastianism.Take him unto you, nevertheless, and dispose of him as
ye think meet.--Dingwall," he continued, calling a sort of aid-de-camp,
who slept in the next apartment, "let the guard posted on the malignant
Evandale give up their post to those whom Captain Morton shall appoint to
relieve them.--The prisoner," he said, again addressing Poundtext and
Morton, "is now at your disposal, gentlemen.But remember, that for all
these things there will one day come a term of heavy accounting."So saying, he turned abruptly into an inner apartment, without bidding
them good evening.His two visitors, after a moment's consideration,
agreed it would be prudent to ensure the prisoner's personal safety, by
placing over him an additional guard, chosen from their own parishioners.A band of them happened to be stationed in the hamlet, having been
attached, for the time, to Burley's command, in order that the men might
be gratified by remaining as long as possible near to their own homes.They were, in general, smart, active young fellows, and were usually
called by their companions, the Marksmen of Milnwood.By Morton's desire,
four of these lads readily undertook the task of sentinels, and he left
with them Headrigg, on whose fidelity he could depend, with instructions
to call him, if any thing remarkable happened.This arrangement being made, Morton and his colleague took possession,
for the night, of such quarters as the over-crowded and miserable hamlet
could afford them.They did not, however, separate for repose till they
had drawn up a memorial of the grievances of the moderate presbyterians,
which was summed up with a request of free toleration for their religion
in future, and that they should be permitted to attend gospel ordinances
as dispensed by their own clergymen, without oppression or molestation.Their petition proceeded to require that a free parliament should be
called for settling the affairs of church and state, and for redressing
the injuries sustained by the subject; and that all those who either now
were, or had been, in arms, for obtaining these ends, should be
indemnified.Morton could not but strongly hope that these terms, which
comprehended all that was wanted, or wished for, by the moderate party
among the insurgents, might, when thus cleared of the violence of
fanaticism, find advocates even among the royalists, as claiming only the
ordinary rights of Scottish freemen.He had the more confidence of a favourable reception, that the Duke of
Monmouth, to whom Charles had intrusted the charge of subduing this
rebellion, was a man of gentle, moderate, and accessible disposition,
well known to be favourable to the presbyterians, and invested by the
king with full powers to take measures for quieting the disturbances in
Scotland.It seemed to Morton, that all that was necessary for
influencing him in their favour was to find a fit and sufficiently
respectable channel of communication, and such seemed to be opened
through the medium of Lord Evandale.He resolved, therefore, to visit the
prisoner early in the morning, in order to sound his dispositions to
undertake the task of mediator; but an accident happened which led him to
anticipate his purpose.Gie ower your house, lady, he said,--
                    Gie ower your house to me.Morton had finished the revisal and the making out of a fair copy of the
paper on which he and Poundtext had agreed to rest as a full statement of
the grievances of their party, and the conditions on which the greater
part of the insurgents would be contented to lay down their arms; and he
was about to betake himself to repose, when there was a knocking at the
door of his apartment."Enter," said Morton; and the round bullethead of Cuddie Headrigg was
thrust into the room."Come in," said Morton, "and tell me what you want."Na, stir; but I hae brought ane to speak wi' you.""Ane o' your auld acquaintance," said Cuddie; and, opening the door more
fully, he half led, half dragged in a woman, whose face was muffled in
her plaid.--"Come, come, ye needna be sae bashfu' before auld
acquaintance, Jenny," said Cuddie, pulling down the veil, and discovering
to his master the well-remembered countenance of Jenny Dennison."Tell
his honour, now--there's a braw lass--tell him what ye were wanting to
say to Lord Evandale, mistress.""What was I wanting to say," answered Jenny, "to his honour himsell the
other morning, when I visited him in captivity, ye muckle hash?--D'ye
think that folk dinna want to see their friends in adversity, ye dour
crowdy-eater?"This reply was made with Jenny's usual volubility; but her voice
quivered, her cheek was thin and pale, the tears stood in her eyes, her
hand trembled, her manner was fluttered, and her whole presence bore
marks of recent suffering and privation, as well as nervous and
hysterical agitation."You know how much I
owe you in many respects, and can hardly make a request that I will not
grant, if in my power.""Many thanks, Milnwood," said the weeping damsel; "but ye were aye a kind
gentleman, though folk say ye hae become sair changed now.""A' body says," replied Jenny, "that you and the whigs hae made a vow to
ding King Charles aff the throne, and that neither he, nor his posteriors
from generation to generation, shall sit upon it ony mair; and John
Gudyill threeps ye're to gie a' the church organs to the pipers, and burn
the Book o' Common-prayer by the hands of the common hangman, in revenge
of the Covenant that was burnt when the king cam hame.""My friends at Tillietudlem judge too hastily and too ill of me,"
answered Morton."I wish to have free exercise of my own religion,
without insulting any other; and as to your family, I only desire an
opportunity to show them I have the same friendship and kindness as
ever.""Bless your kind heart for saying sae," said Jenny, bursting into a flood
of tears; "and they never needed kindness or friendship mair, for they
are famished for lack o' food."replied Morton, "I have heard of scarcity, but not of famine!It is possible?--Have the ladies and the Major"--

"They hae suffered like the lave o' us," replied Jenny; "for they shared
every bit and sup wi' the whole folk in the Castle--I'm sure my poor een
see fifty colours wi' faintness, and my head's sae dizzy wi' the
mirligoes that I canna stand my lane."The thinness of the poor girl's cheek, and the sharpness of her features,
bore witness to the truth of what she said."Sit down," he said, "for God's sake!"forcing her into the only chair
the apartment afforded, while he himself strode up and down the room in
horror and impatience."I knew not of this," he exclaimed in broken
ejaculations,--"I could not know of it.--Cold-blooded, iron-hearted
fanatic--deceitful villain!--Cuddie, fetch refreshments--food--wine, if
possible--whatever you can find.""Whisky is gude eneugh for her," muttered Cuddie; "ane wadna hae thought
that gude meal was sae scant amang them, when the quean threw sae muckle
gude kail-brose scalding het about my lugs."Faint and miserable as Jenny seemed to be, she could not hear the
allusion to her exploit during the storm of the Castle, without bursting
into a laugh which weakness soon converted into a hysterical giggle.Confounded at her state, and reflecting with horror on the distress which
must have been in the Castle, Morton repeated his commands to Headrigg in
a peremptory manner; and when he had departed, endeavoured to soothe his
visitor."You come, I suppose, by the orders of your mistress, to visit Lord
Evandale?--Tell me what she desires; her orders shall be my law."Jenny appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, "Your honour is sae
auld a friend, I must needs trust to you, and tell the truth.""Be assured, Jenny," said Morton, observing that she hesitated, "that you
will best serve your mistress by dealing sincerely with me.""Weel, then, ye maun ken we're starving, as I said before, and have been
mair days than ane; and the Major has sworn that he expects relief daily,
and that he will not gie ower the house to the enemy till we have eaten
up his auld boots,--and they are unco thick in the soles, as ye may weel
mind, forby being teugh in the upper-leather.The dragoons, again, they
think they will be forced to gie up at last, and they canna bide hunger
weel, after the life they led at free quarters for this while bypast; and
since Lord Evandale's taen, there's nae guiding them; and Inglis says
he'll gie up the garrison to the whigs, and the Major and the leddies
into the bargain, if they will but let the troopers gang free themsells."said Morton; "why do they not make terms for all in the
Castle?""They are fear'd for denial o' quarter to themsells, having dune sae
muckle mischief through the country; and Burley has hanged ane or twa o'
them already--sae they want to draw their ain necks out o' the collar at
hazard o' honest folk's.""And you were sent," continued Morton, "to carry to Lord Evandale the
unpleasant news of the men's mutiny?""Just e'en sae," said Jenny; "Tam Halliday took the rue, and tauld me a'
about it, and gat me out o' the Castle to tell Lord Evandale, if possibly
I could win at him.""Well-a-day, ay," answered the afflicted damsel; "but maybe he could mak
fair terms for us--or, maybe, he could gie us some good advice--or,
maybe, he might send his orders to the dragoons to be civil--or"--

"Or, maybe," said Morton, "you were to try if it were possible to set him
at liberty?""If it were sae," answered Jenny with spirit, "it wadna be the first time
I hae done my best to serve a friend in captivity.""True, Jenny," replied Morton, "I were most ungrateful to forget it.But
here comes Cuddie with refreshments--I will go and do your errand to Lord
Evandale, while you take some food and wine.""It willna be amiss ye should ken," said Cuddie to his master, "that this
Jenny--this Mrs Dennison, was trying to cuittle favour wi' Tam Rand, the
miller's man, to win into Lord Evandale's room without ony body kennin'.She wasna thinking, the gipsy, that I was at her elbow.""And an unco fright ye gae me when ye cam ahint and took a grip o' me,"
said Jenny, giving him a sly twitch with her finger and her thumb--"if ye
hadna been an auld acquaintance, ye daft gomeril"--

Cuddie, somewhat relenting, grinned a smile on his artful mistress, while
Morton wrapped himself up in his cloak, took his sword under his arm, and
went straight to the place of the young nobleman's confinement.He asked
the sentinels if any thing extraordinary had occurred."Nothing worth notice," they said, "excepting the lass that Cuddie took
up, and two couriers that Captain Balfour had dispatched, one to the
Reverend Ephraim Macbriar, another to Kettledrummle," both of whom were
beating the drum ecclesiastic in different towns between the position of
Burley and the head-quarters of the main army near Hamilton."The purpose, I presume," said Morton, with an affectation of
indifference, "was to call them hither.""So I understand," answered the sentinel, who had spoke with the
messengers.He is summoning a triumphant majority of the council, thought Morton to
himself, for the purpose of sanctioning whatever action of atrocity he
may determine upon, and thwarting opposition by authority.I must be
speedy, or I shall lose my opportunity.When he entered the place of Lord Evandale's confinement, he found him
ironed, and reclining on a flock bed in the wretched garret of a
miserable cottage.He was either in a slumber, or in deep meditation,
when Morton entered, and turned on him, when aroused, a countenance so
much reduced by loss of blood, want of sleep, and scarcity of food, that
no one could have recognised in it the gallant soldier who had behaved
with so much spirit at the skirmish of Loudon-hill.He displayed some
surprise at the sudden entrance of Morton."I am sorry to see you thus, my lord," said that youthful leader."I have heard you are an admirer of poetry," answered the prisoner; "in
that case, Mr Morton, you may remember these lines,--

              'Stone walls do not a prison make,
               Or iron bars a cage;
               A free and quiet mind can take
               These for a hermitage.'But, were my imprisonment less endurable, I am given to expect to-morrow
a total enfranchisement.""Surely," answered Lord Evandale; "I have no other prospect.Your
comrade, Burley, has already dipped his hand in the blood of men whose
meanness of rank and obscurity of extraction might have saved them.I
cannot boast such a shield from his vengeance, and I expect to meet its
extremity.""But Major Bellenden," said Morton, "may surrender, in order to preserve
your life.""Never, while there is one man to defend the battlement, and that man has
one crust to eat.I know his gallant resolution, and grieved should I be
if he changed it for my sake."Morton hastened to acquaint him with the mutiny among the dragoons, and
their resolution to surrender the Castle, and put the ladies of the
family, as well as the Major, into the hands of the enemy.Lord Evandale
seemed at first surprised, and something incredulous, but immediately
afterwards deeply affected.he said--"How is this misfortune to be averted?""Hear me, my lord," said Morton."I believe you may not be unwilling to
bear the olive branch between our master the King, and that part of his
subjects which is now in arms, not from choice, but necessity.""You construe me but justly," said Lord Evandale; "but to what does this
tend?""Permit me, my lord"--continued Morton."I will set you at liberty upon
parole; nay, you may return to the Castle, and shall have a safe conduct
for the ladies, the Major, and all who leave it, on condition of its
instant surrender.In contributing to bring this about you will only
submit to circumstances; for, with a mutiny in the garrison, and without
provisions, it will be found impossible to defend the place twenty-four
hours longer.Those, therefore, who refuse to accompany your lordship,
must take their fate.You and your followers shall have a free pass to
Edinburgh, or where-ever the Duke of Monmouth may be.In return for your
liberty, we hope that you will recommend to the notice of his Grace, as
Lieutenant-General of Scotland, this humble petition and remonstrance,
containing the grievances which have occasioned this insurrection, a
redress of which being granted, I will answer with my head, that the
great body of the insurgents will lay down their arms."Lord Evandale read over the paper with attention."Mr Morton," he said, "in my simple judgment, I see little objection that
can be made to the measure here recommended; nay, farther, I believe, in
many respects, they may meet the private sentiments of the Duke of
Monmouth: and yet, to deal frankly with you, I have no hopes of their
being granted, unless, in the first place, you were to lay down your
arms.""The doing so," answered Morton, "would be virtually conceding that we
had no right to take them up; and that, for one, I will never agree to.""Perhaps it is hardly to be expected you should," said Lord Evandale;
"and yet on that point I am certain the negotiations will be wrecked.I
am willing, however, having frankly told you my opinion, to do all in my
power to bring about a reconciliation.""It is all we can wish or expect," replied Morton; "the issue is in God's
hands, who disposes the hearts of princes.--You accept, then, the safe
conduct?""Certainly," answered Lord Evandale; "and if I do not enlarge upon the
obligation incurred by your having saved my life a second time, believe
that I do not feel it the less.""And the garrison of Tillietudlem?""Shall be withdrawn as you propose," answered the young nobleman."I am
sensible the Major will be unable to bring the mutineers to reason; and I
tremble to think of the consequences, should the ladies and the brave old
man be delivered up to this bloodthirsty ruffian, Burley.""You are in that case free," said Morton."Prepare to mount on horseback;
a few men whom I can trust shall attend you till you are in safety from
our parties."Leaving Lord Evandale in great surprise and joy at this unexpected
deliverance, Morton hastened to get a few chosen men under arms and on
horseback, each rider holding the rein of a spare horse.Jenny, who,
while she partook of her refreshment, had contrived to make up her breach
with Cuddie, rode on the left hand of that valiant cavalier.The tramp of
their horses was soon heard under the window of Lord Evandale's prison.Two men, whom he did not know, entered the apartment, disencumbered him
of his fetters, and, conducting him down stairs, mounted him in the
centre of the detachment.They set out at a round trot towards
Tillietudlem.The moonlight was giving way to the dawn when they approached that
ancient fortress, and its dark massive tower had just received the first
pale colouring of the morning.The party halted at the Tower barrier, not
venturing to approach nearer for fear of the fire of the place.Lord
Evandale alone rode up to the gate, followed at a distance by Jenny
Dennison.As they approached the gate, there was heard to arise in the
court-yard a tumult, which accorded ill with the quiet serenity of a
summer dawn.Cries and oaths were heard, a pistol-shot or two were
discharged, and every thing announced that the mutiny had broken out.At
this crisis Lord Evandale arrived at the gate where Halliday was
sentinel.On hearing Lord Evandale's voice, he instantly and gladly
admitted him, and that nobleman arrived among the mutinous troopers like
a man dropped from the clouds.They were in the act of putting their
design into execution, of seizing the place into their own hands, and
were about to disarm and overpower Major Bellenden and Harrison, and
others of the Castle, who were offering the best resistance in their
power.The appearance of Lord Evandale changed the scene.He seized Inglis by
the collar, and, upbraiding him with his villainy, ordered two of his
comrades to seize and bind him, assuring the others, that their only
chance of impunity consisted in instant submission.He then ordered the
men into their ranks.They hesitated; but the instinct of discipline, joined to their
persuasion that the authority of their officer, so boldly exerted, must
be supported by some forces without the gate, induced them to submit."Take away those arms," said Lord Evandale to the people of the Castle;
"they shall not be restored until these men know better the use for which
they are intrusted with them.--And now," he continued, addressing the
mutineers, "begone!--Make the best use of your time, and of a truce of
three hours, which the enemy are contented to allow you.Take the road to
Edinburgh, and meet me at the House-of-Muir.I need not bid you beware of
committing violence by the way; you will not, in your present condition,
provoke resentment for your own sakes.Let your punctuality show that you
mean to atone for this morning's business."The disarmed soldiers shrunk in silence from the presence of their
officer, and, leaving the Castle, took the road to the place of
rendezvous, making such haste as was inspired by the fear of meeting with
some detached party of the insurgents, whom their present defenceless
condition, and their former violence, might inspire with thoughts of
revenge.Inglis, whom Evandale destined for punishment, remained in
custody.Halliday was praised for his conduct, and assured of succeeding
to the rank of the culprit.These arrangements being hastily made, Lord
Evandale accosted the Major, before whose eyes the scene had seemed to
pass like the change of a dream."My dear Major, we must give up the place.""I was in hopes you had brought
reinforcements and supplies.""Not a man--not a pound of meal," answered Lord Evandale."Yet I am blithe to see you," returned the honest Major; "we were
informed yesterday that these psalm-singing rascals had a plot on your
life, and I had mustered the scoundrelly dragoons ten minutes ago in
order to beat up Burley's quarters and get you out of limbo, when the dog
Inglis, instead of obeying me, broke out into open mutiny.--But what is
to be done now?""I have, myself, no choice," said Lord Evandale; "I am a prisoner,
released on parole, and bound for Edinburgh.You and the ladies must take
the same route.I have, by the favour of a friend, a safe conduct and
horses for you and your retinue--for God's sake make haste--you cannot
propose to hold out with seven or eight men, and without provisions--
Enough has been done for honour, and enough to render the defence of the
highest consequence to government.More were needless, as well as
desperate.The English troops are arrived at Edinburgh, and will speedily
move upon Hamilton.The possession of Tillietudlem by the rebels will be
but temporary.""If you think so, my lord," said the veteran, with a reluctant sigh,--"I
know you only advise what is honourable--if, then, you really think the
case inevitable, I must submit; for the mutiny of these scoundrels would
render it impossible to man the walls.--Gudyill, let the women call up
their mistresses, and all be ready to march--But if I could believe that
my remaining in these old walls, till I was starved to a mummy, could do
the King's cause the least service, old Miles Bellenden would not leave
them while there was a spark of life in his body!"The ladies, already alarmed by the mutiny, now heard the determination of
the Major, in which they readily acquiesced, though not without some
groans and sighs on the part of Lady Margaret, which referred, as usual,
to the _dejeune_; of his Most Sacred Majesty in the halls which were now
to be abandoned to rebels.Hasty preparations were made for evacuating
the Castle; and long ere the dawn was distinct enough for discovering
objects with precision, the ladies, with Major Bellenden, Harrison,
Gudyill, and the other domestics, were mounted on the led horses, and
others which had been provided in the neighbourhood, and proceeded
towards the north, still escorted by four of the insurgent horsemen.The
rest of the party who had accompanied Lord Evandale from the hamlet, took
possession of the deserted Castle, carefully forbearing all outrage or
acts of plunder.And when the sun arose, the scarlet and blue colours of
the Scottish Covenant floated from the Keep of Tillietudlem.And, to my breast, a bodkin in her hand
               Were worth a thousand daggers.The cavalcade which left the Castle of Tillietudlem, halted for a few
minutes at the small town of Bothwell, after passing the outposts of the
insurgents, to take some slight refreshments which their attendants had
provided, and which were really necessary to persons who had suffered
considerably by want of proper nourishment.They then pressed forward
upon the road towards Edinburgh, amid the lights of dawn which were now
rising on the horizon.It might have been expected, during the course of
the journey, that Lord Evandale would have been frequently by the side of
Miss Edith Bellenden.Yet, after his first salutations had been
exchanged, and every precaution solicitously adopted which could serve
for her accommodation, he rode in the van of the party with Major
Bellenden, and seemed to abandon the charge of immediate attendance upon
his lovely niece to one of the insurgent cavaliers, whose dark military
cloak, with the large flapped hat and feather, which drooped over his
face, concealed at once his figure and his features.They rode side by
side in silence for more than two miles, when the stranger addressed Miss
Bellenden in a tremulous and suppressed voice."Miss Bellenden," he said, "must have friends wherever she is known; even
among those whose conduct she now disapproves.Is there any thing that
such can do to show their respect for her, and their regret for her
sufferings?""Let them learn for their own sakes," replied Edith, "to venerate the
laws, and to spare innocent blood.Let them return to their allegiance,
and I can forgive them all that I have suffered, were it ten times more.""You think it impossible, then," rejoined the cavalier, "for any one to
serve in our ranks, having the weal of his country sincerely at heart,
and conceiving himself in the discharge of a patriotic duty?""It might be imprudent, while so absolutely in your power," replied Miss
Bellenden, "to answer that question.""Not in the present instance, I plight you the word of a soldier,"
replied the horseman."I have been taught candour from my birth," said Edith; "and, if I am to
speak at all, I must utter my real sentiments.God only can judge the
heart--men must estimate intentions by actions.Treason, murder by the
sword and by gibbet, the oppression of a private family such as ours, who
were only in arms for the defence of the established government, and of
our own property, are actions which must needs sully all that have
accession to them, by whatever specious terms they may be gilded over.""The guilt of civil war," rejoined the horseman--"the miseries which it
brings in its train, lie at the door of those who provoked it by illegal
oppression, rather than of such as are driven to arms in order to assert
their natural rights as freemen.""That is assuming the question," replied Edith, "which ought to be
proved.Each party contends that they are right in point of principle,
and therefore the guilt must lie with them who first drew the sword; as,
in an affray, law holds those to be the criminals who are the first to
have recourse to violence."said the horseman, "were our vindication to rest there, how easy
would it be to show that we have suffered with a patience which almost
seemed beyond the power of humanity, ere we were driven by oppression
into open resistance!--But I perceive," he continued, sighing deeply,
"that it is vain to plead before Miss Bellenden a cause which she has
already prejudged, perhaps as much from her dislike of the persons as of
the principles of those engaged in it.""Pardon me," answered Edith; "I have stated with freedom my opinion
of the principles of the insurgents; of their persons I know
nothing--excepting in one solitary instance.""And that instance," said the horseman, "has influenced your opinion of
the whole body?""Far from it," said Edith; "he is--at least I once thought him--one in
whose scale few were fit to be weighed--he is--or he seemed--one of early
talent, high faith, pure morality, and warm affections.Can I approve of
a rebellion which has made such a man, formed to ornament, to enlighten,
and to defend his country, the companion of gloomy and ignorant fanatics,
or canting hypocrites,--the leader of brutal clowns,--the brother-in-arms
to banditti and highway murderers?--Should you meet such an one in your
camp, tell him that Edith Bellenden has wept more over his fallen
character, blighted prospects, and dishonoured name, than over the
distresses of her own house,--and that she has better endured that famine
which has wasted her cheek and dimmed her eye, than the pang of heart
which attended the reflection by and through whom these calamities were
inflicted."As she thus spoke, she turned upon her companion a countenance, whose
faded cheek attested the reality of her sufferings, even while it glowed
with the temporary animation which accompanied her language.The horseman
was not insensible to the appeal; he raised his hand to his brow with the
sudden motion of one who feels a pang shoot along his brain, passed it
hastily over his face, and then pulled the shadowing hat still deeper on
his forehead.The movement, and the feelings which it excited, did not
escape Edith, nor did she remark them without emotion."And yet," she said, "should the person of whom I speak seem to you too
deeply affected by the hard opinion of--of--an early friend, say to him,
that sincere repentance is next to innocence;--that, though fallen from a
height not easily recovered, and the author of much mischief, because
gilded by his example, he may still atone in some measure for the evil he
has done."asked the cavalier, in the same suppressed, and
almost choked voice."By lending his efforts to restore the blessings of peace to his
distracted countrymen, and to induce the deluded rebels to lay down their
arms.By saving their blood, he may atone for that which has been already
spilt;--and he that shall be most active in accomplishing this great end,
will best deserve the thanks of this age, and an honoured remembrance in
the next.""And in such a peace," said her companion, with a firm voice, "Miss
Bellenden would not wish, I think, that the interests of the people were
sacrificed unreservedly to those of the crown?""I am but a girl," was the young lady's reply; "and I scarce can speak on
the subject without presumption.But, since I have gone so far, I will
fairly add, I would wish to see a peace which should give rest to all
parties, and secure the subjects from military rapine, which I detest as
much as I do the means now adopted to resist it.""Miss Bellenden," answered Henry Morton, raising his face, and speaking
in his natural tone, "the person who has lost such a highly-valued place
in your esteem, has yet too much spirit to plead his cause as a criminal;
and, conscious that he can no longer claim a friend's interest in your
bosom, he would be silent under your hard censure, were it not that he
can refer to the honoured testimony of Lord Evandale, that his earnest
wishes and most active exertions are, even now, directed to the
accomplishment of such a peace as the most loyal cannot censure."He bowed with dignity to Miss Bellenden, who, though her language
intimated that she well knew to whom she had been speaking, probably had
not expected that he would justify himself with so much animation.She
returned his salute, confused and in silence.Morton then rode forward to
the head of the party.exclaimed Major Bellenden, surprised at the sudden
apparition."The same," answered Morton; "who is sorry that he labours under the
harsh construction of Major Bellenden and his family.He commits to my
Lord Evandale," he continued, turning towards the young nobleman, and
bowing to him, "the charge of undeceiving his friends, both regarding the
particulars of his conduct and the purity of his motives.Farewell, Major
Bellenden--All happiness attend you and yours--May we meet again in
happier and better times!""Believe me," said Lord Evandale, "your confidence, Mr Morton, is not
misplaced; I will endeavour to repay the great services I have received
from you by doing my best to place your character on its proper footing
with Major Bellenden, and all whose esteem you value.""I expected no less from your generosity, my lord," said Morton.He then called his followers, and rode off along the heath in the
direction of Hamilton, their feathers waving and their steel caps
glancing in the beams of the rising sun.Cuddie Headrigg alone remained
an instant behind his companions to take an affectionate farewell of
Jenny Dennison, who had contrived, during this short morning's ride, to
re-establish her influence over his susceptible bosom.A straggling tree
or two obscured, rather than concealed, their _tete-a-tete_, as they
halted their horses to bid adieu."Fare ye weel, Jenny," said Cuddie, with a loud exertion of his lungs,
intended perhaps to be a sigh, but rather resembling the intonation of a
groan,--"Ye'll think o' puir Cuddie sometimes--an honest lad that lo'es
ye, Jenny; ye'll think o' him now and then?""Whiles--at brose-time," answered the malicious damsel, unable either to
suppress the repartee, or the arch smile which attended it.[Illustration: Whiles--at Brose-Time--pa098]


Cuddie took his revenge as rustic lovers are wont, and as Jenny probably
expected,--caught his mistress round the neck, kissed her cheeks and lips
heartily, and then turned his horse and trotted after his master."Deil's in the fallow," said Jenny, wiping her lips and adjusting her
head-dress, "he has twice the spunk o' Tam Halliday, after a'.--Coming,
my leddy, coming--Lord have a care o' us, I trust the auld leddy didna
see us!""Jenny," said Lady Margaret, as the damsel came up, "was not that young
man who commanded the party the same that was captain of the popinjay,
and who was afterwards prisoner at Tillietudlem on the morning
Claverhouse came there?"Jenny, happy that the query had no reference to her own little matters,
looked at her young mistress, to discover, if possible, whether it was
her cue to speak truth or not.Not being able to catch any hint to guide
her, she followed her instinct as a lady's maid, and lied."I dinna believe it was him, my leddy," said Jenny, as confidently as if
she had been saying her catechism; "he was a little black man, that.""You must have been blind, Jenny," said the Major: "Henry Morton is tall
and fair, and that youth is the very man.""I had ither thing ado than be looking at him," said Jenny, tossing her
head; "he may be as fair as a farthing candle, for me.""Is it not," said Lady Margaret, "a blessed escape which we have made,
out of the hands of so desperate and bloodthirsty a fanatic?""You are deceived, madam," said Lord Evandale; "Mr Morton merits such a
title from no one, but least from us.That I am now alive, and that you
are now on your safe retreat to your friends, instead of being prisoners
to a real fanatical homicide, is solely and entirely owing to the prompt,
active, and energetic humanity of this young gentleman."He then went into a particular narrative of the events with which the
reader is acquainted, dwelling upon the merits of Morton, and expatiating
on the risk at which he had rendered them these important services, as if
he had been a brother instead of a rival."I were worse than ungrateful," he said, "were I silent on the merits of
the man who has twice saved my life.""I would willingly think well of Henry Morton, my lord," replied Major
Bellenden; "and I own he has behaved handsomely to your lordship and to
us; but I cannot have the same allowances which it pleases your lordship
to entertain for his present courses.""You are to consider," replied Lord Evandale, "that he has been partly
forced upon them by necessity; and I must add, that his principles,
though differing in some degree from my own, are such as ought to command
respect.Claverhouse, whose knowledge of men is not to be disputed, spoke
justly of him as to his extraordinary qualities, but with prejudice, and
harshly, concerning his principles and motives.""You have not been long in learning all his extraordinary qualities, my
lord," answered Major Bellenden."I, who have known him from boyhood,
could, before this affair, have said much of his good principles and
good-nature; but as to his high talents"--

"They were probably hidden, Major," replied the generous Lord Evandale,
"even from himself, until circumstances called them forth; and, if I have
detected them, it was only because our intercourse and conversation
turned on momentous and important subjects.He is now labouring to bring
this rebellion to an end, and the terms he has proposed are so moderate,
that they shall not want my hearty recommendation.""And have you hopes," said Lady Margaret, "to accomplish a scheme so
comprehensive?""I should have, madam, were every whig as moderate as Morton, and every
loyalist as disinterested as Major Bellenden.But such is the fanaticism
and violent irritation of both parties, that I fear nothing will end this
civil war save the edge of the sword."It may be readily supposed, that Edith listened with the deepest interest
to this conversation.While she regretted that she had expressed herself
harshly and hastily to her lover, she felt a conscious and proud
satisfaction that his character was, even in the judgment of his
noble-minded rival, such as her own affection had once spoke it."Civil feuds and domestic prejudices," she said, "may render it necessary
for me to tear his remembrance from my heart; but it is not small relief
to know assuredly, that it is worthy of the place it has so long retained
there."While Edith was thus retracting her unjust resentment, her lover arrived
at the camp of the insurgents, near Hamilton, which he found in
considerable confusion.Certain advices had arrived that the royal army,
having been recruited from England by a large detachment of the King's
Guards, were about to take the field.Fame magnified their numbers and
their high state of equipment and discipline, and spread abroad other
circumstances, which dismayed the courage of the insurgents.What favour
they might have expected from Monmouth, was likely to be intercepted by
the influence of those associated with him in command.His
lieutenant-general was the celebrated General Thomas Dalzell, who, having
practised the art of war in the then barbarous country of Russia, was as
much feared for his cruelty and indifference to human life and human
sufferings, as respected for his steady loyalty and undaunted valour.This man was second in command to Monmouth, and the horse were commanded
by Claverhouse, burning with desire to revenge the death of his nephew,
and his defeat at Drumclog.To these accounts was added the most
formidable and terrific description of the train of artillery and the
cavalry force with which the royal army took the field.[Note:  Royal Army at Bothwell Bridge.A Cameronian muse was
     awakened from slumber on this doleful occasion, and gave the
     following account of the muster of the royal forces, in poetry
     nearly as melancholy as the subject:--

                    They marched east through Lithgow-town
                    For to enlarge their forces;
                    And sent for all the north-country
                    To come, both foot and horses.Montrose did come and Athole both,
                    And with them many more;
                    And all the Highland Amorites
                    That had been there before.The Lowdien Mallisha--Lothian Militia they
                    Came with their coats of blew;
                    Five hundred men from London came,
                    Claid in a reddish hue.When they were assembled one and all,
                    A full brigade were they;
                    Like to a pack of hellish hounds,
                    Roreing after their prey.When they were all provided well,
                    In armour and amonition,
                    Then thither wester did they come,
                    Most cruel of intention.The royalists celebrated their victory in stanzas of equal merit.Specimens of both may be found in the curious collection of Fugitive
     Scottish Poetry, principally of the Seventeenth Century, printed for
     the Messrs Laing, Edinburgh.]Large bodies, composed of the Highland clans, having in language,
religion, and manners, no connexion with the insurgents, had been
summoned to join the royal army under their various chieftains; and these
Amorites, or Philistines, as the insurgents termed them, came like eagles
to the slaughter.In fact, every person who could ride or run at the
King's command, was summoned to arms, apparently with the purpose of
forfeiting and fining such men of property whom their principles might
deter from joining the royal standard, though prudence prevented them
from joining that of the insurgent Presbyterians.In short, everyrumour
tended to increase the apprehension among the insurgents, that the King's
vengeance had only been delayed in order that it might fall more certain
and more heavy.Morton endeavoured to fortify the minds of the common people by pointing
out the probable exaggeration of these reports, and by reminding them of
the strength of their own situation, with an unfordable river in front,
only passable by a long and narrow bridge.He called to their remembrance
their victory over Claverhouse when their numbers were few, and then much
worse disciplined and appointed for battle than now; showed them that the
ground on which they lay afforded, by its undulation, and the thickets
which intersected it, considerable protection against artillery, and even
against cavalry, if stoutly defended; and that their safety, in fact,
depended on their own spirit and resolution.But while Morton thus endeavoured to keep up the courage of the army at
large, he availed himself of those discouraging rumours to endeavour to
impress on the minds of the leaders the necessity of proposing to the
government moderate terms of accommodation, while they were still
formidable as commanding an unbroken and numerous army.He pointed out to
them, that, in the present humour of their followers, it could hardly be
expected that they would engage, with advantage, the well-appointed and
regular force of the Duke of Monmouth; and that if they chanced, as was
most likely, to be defeated and dispersed, the insurrection in which they
had engaged, so far from being useful to the country, would be rendered
the apology for oppressing it more severely.Pressed by these arguments, and feeling it equally dangerous to remain
together, or to dismiss their forces, most of the leaders readily agreed,
that if such terms could be obtained as had been transmitted to the Duke
of Monmouth by the hands of Lord Evandale, the purpose for which they had
taken up arms would be, in a great measure, accomplished.They then
entered into similar resolutions, and agreed to guarantee the petition
and remonstrance which had been drawn up by Morton.On the contrary,
there were still several leaders, and those men whose influence with the
people exceeded that of persons of more apparent consequence, who
regarded every proposal of treaty which did not proceed on the basis of
the Solemn League and Covenant of 1640, as utterly null and void,
impious, and unchristian.These men diffused their feelings among the
multitude, who had little foresight, and nothing to lose, and persuaded
many that the timid counsellors who recommended peace upon terms short of
the dethronement of the royal family, and the declared independence of
the church with respect to the state, were cowardly labourers, who were
about to withdraw their hands from the plough, and despicable trimmers,
who sought only a specious pretext for deserting their brethren in arms.These contradictory opinions were fiercely argued in each tent of the
insurgent army, or rather in the huts or cabins which served in the place
of tents.Violence in language often led to open quarrels and blows, and
the divisions into which the army of sufferers was rent served as too
plain a presage of their future fate.The curse of growing factions and divisions
               Still vex your councils!The prudence of Morton found sufficient occupation in stemming the
furious current of these contending parties, when, two days after his
return to Hamilton, he was visited by his friend and colleague, the
Reverend Mr Poundtext, flying, as he presently found, from the face of
John Balfour of Burley, whom he left not a little incensed at the share
he had taken in the liberation of Lord Evandale.When the worthy divine
had somewhat recruited his spirits, after the hurry and fatigue of his
journey, he proceeded to give Morton an account of what had passed in the
vicinity of Tillietudlem after the memorable morning of his departure.The night march of Morton had been accomplished with such dexterity,
and the men were so faithful to their trust, that Burley received no
intelligence of what had happened until the morning was far advanced.His first enquiry was, whether Macbriar and Kettledrummle had arrived,
agreeably to the summons which he had dispatched at midnight.Macbriar
had come, and Kettledrummle, though a heavy traveller, might, he was
informed, be instantly expected.Burley then dispatched a messenger to
Morton's quarters to summon him to an immediate council.The messenger
returned with news that he had left the place.Poundtext was next
summoned; but he thinking, as he said himself, that it was ill dealing
with fractious folk, had withdrawn to his own quiet manse, preferring a
dark ride, though he had been on horseback the whole preceding day, to a
renewal in the morning of a controversy with Burley, whose ferocity
overawed him when unsupported by the firmness of Morton.Burley's next
enquiries were directed after Lord Evandale; and great was his rage when
he learned that he had been conveyed away over night by a party of the
marksmen of Milnwood, under the immediate command of Henry Morton
himself.exclaimed Burley, addressing himself to Macbriar; "the
base, mean-spirited traitor, to curry favour for himself with the
government, hath set at liberty the prisoner taken by my own right hand,
through means of whom, I have little doubt, the possession of the place
of strength which hath wrought us such trouble, might now have been in
our hands!"said Macbriar, looking up towards the Keep
of the Castle; "and are not these the colours of the Covenant that float
over its walls?""A stratagem--a mere trick," said Burley, "an insult over our
disappointment, intended to aggravate and embitter our spirits."He was interrupted by the arrival of one of Morton's followers, sent to
report to him the evacuation of the place, and its occupation by the
insurgent forces.Burley was rather driven to fury than reconciled by the
news of this success."I have watched," he said--"I have fought--I have plotted--I have striven
for the reduction of this place--I have forborne to seek to head
enterprises of higher command and of higher honour--I have narrowed their
outgoings, and cut off the springs, and broken the staff of bread within
their walls; and when the men were about to yield themselves to my hand,
that their sons might be bondsmen, and their daughters a laughing-stock
to our whole camp, cometh this youth, without a beard on his chin, and
takes it on him to thrust his sickle into the harvest, and to rend the
prey from the spoiler!Surely the labourer is worthy of his hire, and the
city, with its captives, should be given to him that wins it?""Nay," said Macbriar, who was surprised at the degree of agitation which
Balfour displayed, "chafe not thyself because of the ungodly.Heaven will
use its own instruments; and who knows but this youth"--

"Hush!said Burley; "do not discredit thine own better judgment.It was thou that first badest me beware of this painted sepulchre--this
lacquered piece of copper, that passed current with me for gold.It fares
ill, even with the elect, when they neglect the guidance of such pious
pastors as thou.But our carnal affections will mislead us--this
ungrateful boy's father was mine ancient friend.They must be as earnest
in their struggles as thou, Ephraim Macbriar, that would shake themselves
clear of the clogs and chains of humanity."This compliment touched the preacher in the most sensible part; and
Burley deemed, therefore, he should find little difficulty in moulding
his opinions to the support of his own views, more especially as they
agreed exactly in their high-strained opinions of church government."Let us instantly," he said, "go up to the Tower; there is that among the
records in yonder fortress, which, well used as I can use it, shall be
worth to us a valiant leader and an hundred horsemen.""But will such be the fitting aids of the children of the Covenant?""We have already among us too many who hunger after lands,
and silver and gold, rather than after the Word; it is not by such that
our deliverance shall be wrought out.""Thou errest," said Burley; "we must work by means, and these worldly men
shall be our instruments.At all events, the Moabitish woman shall be
despoiled of her inheritance, and neither the malignant Evandale, nor the
erastian Morton, shall possess yonder castle and lands, though they may
seek in marriage the daughter thereof."So saying, he led the way to Tillietudlem, where he seized upon the plate
and other valuables for the use of the army, ransacked the charter-room,
and other receptacles for family papers, and treated with contempt the
remonstrances of those who reminded him, that the terms granted to the
garrison had guaranteed respect to private property.Burley and Macbriar, having established themselves in their new
acquisition, were joined by Kettledrummle in the course of the day, and
also by the Laird of Langcale, whom that active divine had contrived to
seduce, as Poundtext termed it, from the pure light in which he had been
brought up.Thus united, they sent to the said Poundtext an invitation,
or rather a summons, to attend a council at Tillietudlem.He remembered,
however, that the door had an iron grate, and the Keep a dungeon, and
resolved not to trust himself with his incensed colleagues.He therefore
retreated, or rather fled, to Hamilton, with the tidings, that Burley,
Macbriar, and Kettledrummle, were coming to Hamilton as soon as they
could collect a body of Cameronians sufficient to overawe the rest of the
army."And ye see," concluded Poundtext, with a deep sigh, "that they will then
possess a majority in the council; for Langcale, though he has always
passed for one of the honest and rational party, cannot be suitably or
preceesely termed either fish, or flesh, or gude red-herring--whoever has
the stronger party has Langcale."Thus concluded the heavy narrative of honest Poundtext, who sighed
deeply, as he considered the danger in which he was placed betwixt
unreasonable adversaries amongst themselves and the common enemy from
without.Morton exhorted him to patience, temper, and composure; informed
him of the good hope he had of negotiating for peace and indemnity
through means of Lord Evandale, and made out to him a very fair prospect
that he should again return to his own parchment-bound Calvin, his
evening pipe of tobacco, and his noggin of inspiring ale, providing
always he would afford his effectual support and concurrence to the
measures which he, Morton, had taken for a general pacification.The author does not, by any means,
     desire that Poundtext should be regarded as a just representation of
     the moderate presbyterians, among whom were many ministers whose
     courage was equal to their good sense and sound views of religion.Were he to write the tale anew, he would probably endeavour to give
     the character a higher turn.It is certain, however, that the
     Cameronians imputed to their opponents in opinion concerning the
     Indulgence, or others of their strained and fanatical notions, a
     disposition not only to seek their own safety, but to enjoy
     themselves.Hamilton speaks of three clergymen of this description
     as follows:--

     "They pretended great zeal against the Indulgence; but alas!that
     was all their practice, otherwise being but very gross, which I
     shall but hint at in short.When great Cameron and those with him
     were taking many a cold blast and storm in the fields and among the
     cot-houses in Scotland, these three had for the most part their
     residence in Glasgow, where they found good quarter and a full
     table, which I doubt not but some bestowed upon them from real
     affection to the Lord's cause; and when these three were together,
     their greatest work was who should make the finest and sharpest
     roundel, and breathe the quickest jests upon one another, and to
     tell what valiant acts they were to do, and who could laugh loudest
     and most heartily among them; and when at any time they came out to
     the country, whatever other things they had, they were careful each
     of them to have a great flask of brandy with them, which was very
     heavy to some, particularly to Mr Cameron, Mr Cargill, and Henry
     Hall--I shall name no more."Thus backed and comforted, Poundtext resolved magnanimously to await the
coming of the Cameronians to the general rendezvous.Burley and his confederates had drawn together a considerable body of
these sectaries, amounting to a hundred horse and about fifteen hundred
foot, clouded and severe in aspect, morose and jealous in communication,
haughty of heart, and confident, as men who believed that the pale of
salvation was open for them exclusively; while all other Christians,
however slight were the shades of difference of doctrine from their own,
were in fact little better than outcasts or reprobates.These men entered
the presbyterian camp, rather as dubious and suspicious allies, or
possibly antagonists, than as men who were heartily embarked in the same
cause, and exposed to the same dangers, with their more moderate brethren
in arms.Burley made no private visits to his colleagues, and held no
communication with them on the subject of the public affairs, otherwise
than by sending a dry invitation to them to attend a meeting of the
general council for that evening.On the arrival of Morton and Poundtext at the place of assembly, they
found their brethren already seated.Slight greeting passed between them,
and it was easy to see that no amicable conference was intended by those
who convoked the council.The first question was put by Macbriar, the
sharp eagerness of whose zeal urged him to the van on all occasions.He
desired to know by whose authority the malignant, called Lord Evandale,
had been freed from the doom of death, justly denounced against him."By my authority and Mr Morton's," replied Poundtext; who, besides being
anxious to give his companion a good opinion of his courage, confided
heartily in his support, and, moreover, had much less fear of
encountering one of his own profession, and who confined himself to the
weapons of theological controversy, in which Poundtext feared no man,
than of entering into debate with the stern homicide Balfour."And who, brother," said Kettledrummle, "who gave you authority to
interpose in such a high matter?""The tenor of our commission," answered Poundtext, "gives us authority to
bind and to loose.If Lord Evandale was justly doomed to die by the voice
of one of our number, he was of a surety lawfully redeemed from death by
the warrant of two of us.""Go to, go to," said Burley; "we know your motives; it was to send that
silkworm--that gilded trinket--that embroidered trifle of a lord, to bear
terms of peace to the tyrant.""It was so," replied Morton, who saw his companion begin to flinch before
the fierce eye of Balfour--"it was so; and what then?--Are we to plunge
the nation in endless war, in order to pursue schemes which are equally
wild, wicked, and unattainable?"said Balfour; "he blasphemeth.""It is false," said Morton; "they blaspheme who pretend to expect
miracles, and neglect the use of the human means with which Providence
has blessed them.I repeat it--Our avowed object is the re-establishment
of peace on fair and honourable terms of security to our religion and our
liberty.We disclaim any desire to tyrannize over those of others."The debate would now have run higher than ever, but they were interrupted
by intelligence that the Duke of Monmouth had commenced his march towards
the west, and was already advanced half way from Edinburgh.This news
silenced their divisions for the moment, and it was agreed that the next
day should be held as a fast of general humiliation for the sins of the
land; that the Reverend Mr Poundtext should preach to the army in the
morning, and Kettledrummle in the afternoon; that neither should touch
upon any topics of schism or of division, but animate the soldiers to
resist to the blood, like brethren in a good cause.This healing overture
having been agreed to, the moderate party ventured upon another proposal,
confiding that it would have the support of Langcale, who looked
extremely blank at the news which they had just received, and might be
supposed reconverted to moderate measures.It was to be presumed, they
said, that since the King had not intrusted the command of his forces
upon the present occasion to any of their active oppressors, but, on the
contrary, had employed a nobleman distinguished by gentleness of temper,
and a disposition favourable to their cause, there must be some better
intention entertained towards them than they had yet experienced.They
contended, that it was not only prudent but necessary to ascertain, from
a communication with the Duke of Monmouth, whether he was not charged
with some secret instructions in their favour.This could only be learned
by dispatching an envoy to his army.said Burley, evading a proposal too
reasonable to be openly resisted--"Who will go up to their camp, knowing
that John Grahame of Claverhouse hath sworn to hang up whomsoever we
shall dispatch towards them, in revenge of the death of the young man his
nephew?""Let that be no obstacle," said Morton; "I will with pleasure encounter
any risk attached to the bearer of your errand.""Let him go," said Balfour, apart to Macbriar; "our councils will be well
rid of his presence."The motion, therefore, received no contradiction even from those who were
expected to have been most active in opposing it; and it was agreed that
Henry Morton should go to the camp of the Duke of Monmouth, in order to
discover upon what terms the insurgents would be admitted to treat with
him.As soon as his errand was made known, several of the more moderate
party joined in requesting him to make terms upon the footing of the
petition intrusted to Lord Evandale's hands; for the approach of the
King's army spread a general trepidation, by no means allayed by the high
tone assumed by the Cameronians, which had so little to support it,
excepting their own headlong zeal.With these instructions, and with
Cuddie as his attendant, Morton set forth towards the royal camp, at all
the risks which attend those who assume the office of mediator during the
heat of civil discord.Morton had not proceeded six or seven miles, before he perceived that he
was on the point of falling in with the van of the royal forces; and, as
he ascended a height, saw all the roads in the neighbourhood occupied by
armed men marching in great order towards Bothwell-muir, an open common,
on which they proposed to encamp for that evening, at the distance of
scarcely two miles from the Clyde, on the farther side of which river the
army of the insurgents was encamped.He gave himself up to the first
advanced-guard of cavalry which he met, as bearer of a flag of truce, and
communicated his desire to obtain access to the Duke of Monmouth.The
non-commissioned officer who commanded the party made his report to his
superior, and he again to another in still higher command, and both
immediately rode to the spot where Morton was detained."You are but losing your time, my friend, and risking your life," said
one of them, addressing Morton; "the Duke of Monmouth will receive no
terms from traitors with arms in their hands, and your cruelties have
been such as to authorize retaliation of every kind.Better trot your nag
back and save his mettle to-day, that he may save your life to-morrow.""I cannot think," said Morton, "that even if the Duke of Monmouth should
consider us as criminals, he would condemn so large a body of his
fellow-subjects without even hearing what they have to plead for
themselves.I am conscious of having consented
to, or authorized, no cruelty, and the fear of suffering innocently for
the crimes of others shall not deter me from executing my commission.""I have an idea," said the younger, "that this is the young man of whom
Lord Evandale spoke.""Is my Lord Evandale in the army?""He is not," replied the officer; "we left him at Edinburgh, too much
indisposed to take the field.--Your name, sir, I presume, is Henry
Morton?""We will not oppose your seeing the Duke, sir," said the officer, with
more civility of manner; "but you may assure yourself it will be to no
purpose; for, were his Grace disposed to favour your people, others are
joined in commission with him who will hardly consent to his doing so.""I shall be sorry to find it thus," said Morton; "but my duty requires
that I should persevere in my desire to have an interview with him.""Lumley," said the superior officer, "let the Duke know of Mr Morton's
arrival, and remind his Grace that this is the person of whom Lord
Evandale spoke so highly."The officer returned with a message that the General could not see Mr
Morton that evening, but would receive him by times in the ensuing
morning.He was detained in a neighbouring cottage all night, but treated
with civility, and every thing provided for his accommodation.Early on
the next morning the officer he had first seen came to conduct him to his
audience.The army was drawn out, and in the act of forming column for march, or
attack.The Duke was in the centre, nearly a mile from the place where
Morton had passed the night.In riding towards the General, he had an
opportunity of estimating the force which had been assembled for the
suppression of the hasty and ill-concerted insurrection.There were three
or four regiments of English, the flower of Charles's army--there were
the Scottish Life-Guards, burning with desire to revenge their late
defeat--other Scottish regiments of regulars were also assembled, and a
large body of cavalry, consisting partly of gentlemen-volunteers, partly
of the tenants of the crown who did military duty for their fiefs.Morton
also observed several strong parties of Highlanders drawn from the points
nearest to the Lowland frontiers, a people, as already mentioned,
particularly obnoxious to the western whigs, and who hated and despised
them in the same proportion.These were assembled under their chiefs, and
made part of this formidable array.A complete train of field-artillery
accompanied these troops; and the whole had an air so imposing, that it
seemed nothing short of an actual miracle could prevent the ill-equipped,
ill-modelled, and tumultuary army of the insurgents from being utterly
destroyed.The officer who accompanied Morton endeavoured to gather from
his looks the feelings with which this splendid and awful parade of
military force had impressed him.But, true to the cause he had espoused,
he laboured successfully to prevent the anxiety which he felt from
appearing in his countenance, and looked around him on the warlike
display as on a sight which he expected, and to which he was indifferent."You see the entertainment prepared for you," said the officers."If I had no appetite for it," replied Morton, "I should not have been
accompanying you at this moment.But I shall be better pleased with a
more peaceful regale, for the sake of all parties."As they spoke thus, they approached the commander-in-chief, who,
surrounded by several officers, was seated upon a knoll commanding an
extensive prospect of the distant country, and from which could be easily
discovered the windings of the majestic Clyde, and the distant camp of
the insurgents on the opposite bank.The officers of the royal army
appeared to be surveying the ground, with the purpose of directing an
immediate attack.When Captain Lumley, the officer who accompanied
Morton, had whispered in Monmouth's ear his name and errand, the Duke
made a signal for all around him to retire, excepting only two general
officers of distinction.While they spoke together in whispers for a few
minutes before Morton was permitted to advance, he had time to study the
appearance of the persons with whom he was to treat.It was impossible for any one to look upon the Duke of Monmouth without
being captivated by his personal graces and accomplishments, of which the
great High-Priest of all the Nine afterwards recorded--

"Whate'er he did was done with so much ease, In him alone 'twas natural
to please; His motions all accompanied with grace, And Paradise was
open'd in his face."Yet to a strict observer, the manly beauty of
Monmouth's face was occasionally rendered less striking by an air of
vacillation and uncertainty, which seemed to imply hesitation and doubt
at moments when decisive resolution was most necessary.Beside him stood Claverhouse, whom we have already fully described, and
another general officer whose appearance was singularly striking.His
dress was of the antique fashion of Charles the First's time, and
composed of shamoy leather, curiously slashed, and covered with antique
lace and garniture.His boots and spurs might be referred to the same
distant period.He wore a breastplate, over which descended a grey beard
of venerable length, which he cherished as a mark of mourning for Charles
the First, having never shaved since that monarch was brought to the
scaffold.His head was uncovered, and almost perfectly bald.His high and
wrinkled forehead, piercing grey eyes, and marked features, evinced age
unbroken by infirmity, and stern resolution unsoftened by humanity.Such
is the outline, however feebly expressed, of the celebrated General
Thomas Dalzell,

     [Note:  Usually called Tom Dalzell.In Crichton's Memoirs, edited by
     Swift, where a particular account of this remarkable person's dress
     and habits is given, he is said never to have worn boots.The
     following account of his rencounter with John Paton of Meadowhead,
     showed, that in action at least he wore pretty stout ones, unless
     the reader be inclined to believe in the truth of his having a
     charm, which made him proof against lead."Dalzell," says Paton's biographer, "advanced the whole left wing of
     his army on Colonel Wallace's right.Here Captain Paton behaved with
     great courage and gallantry.Dalzell, knowing him in the former
     wars, advanced upon him himself, thinking to take him prisoner.Upon
     his approach, each presented his pistol.On their first discharge,
     Captain Paton, perceiving his pistol ball to hop upon Dalzell's
     boots, and knowing what was the cause, (he having proof,) put his
     hand in his pocket for some small pieces of silver he had there for
     the purpose, and put one of them into his other pistol.But Dalzell,
     having his eye upon him in the meanwhile, retired behind his own
     man, who by that means was slain."]a man more feared and hated by the whigs than even Claverhouse himself,
and who executed the same violences against them out of a detestation of
their persons, or perhaps an innate severity of temper, which Grahame
only resorted to on political accounts, as the best means of intimidating
the followers of presbytery, and of destroying that sect entirely.The presence of these two generals, one of whom he knew by person, and
the other by description, seemed to Morton decisive of the fate of his
embassy.But, notwithstanding his youth and inexperience, and the
unfavourable reception which his proposals seemed likely to meet with, he
advanced boldly towards them upon receiving a signal to that purpose,
determined that the cause of his country, and of those with whom he had
taken up arms, should suffer nothing from being intrusted to him.Monmouth received him with the graceful courtesy which attended even his
slightest actions; Dalzell regarded him with a stern, gloomy, and
impatient frown; and Claverhouse, with a sarcastic smile and inclination
of his head, seemed to claim him as an old acquaintance."You come, sir, from these unfortunate people, now assembled in arms,"
said the Duke of Monmouth, "and your name, I believe, is Morton; will you
favour us with the pupport of your errand?""It is contained, my lord," answered Morton, "in a paper, termed a
Remonstrance and Supplication, which my Lord Evandale has placed, I
presume, in your Grace's hands?""He has done so, sir," answered the Duke; "and I understand, from Lord
Evandale, that Mr Morton has behaved in these unhappy matters with much
temperance and generosity, for which I have to request his acceptance of
my thanks."Here Morton observed Dalzell shake his head indignantly, and whisper
something into Claverhouse's ear, who smiled in return, and elevated his
eyebrows, but in a degree so slight as scarce to be perceptible.The
Duke, taking the petition from his pocket, proceeded, obviously
struggling between the native gentleness of his own disposition, and
perhaps his conviction that the petitioners demanded no more than their
rights, and the desire, on the other hand, of enforcing the king's
authority, and complying with the sterner opinions of the colleagues in
office, who had been assigned for the purpose of controlling as well as
advising him."There are, Mr Morton, in this paper, proposals, as to the abstract
propriety of which I must now waive delivering any opinion.Some of them
appear to me reasonable and just; and, although I have no express
instructions from the King upon the subject, yet I assure you, Mr Morton,
and I pledge my honour, that I will interpose in your behalf, and use my
utmost influence to procure you satisfaction from his Majesty.But you
must distinctly understand, that I can only treat with supplicants, not
with rebels; and, as a preliminary to every act of favour on my side, I
must insist upon your followers laying down their arms and dispersing
themselves.""To do so, my Lord Duke," replied Morton, undauntedly, "were to
acknowledge ourselves the rebels that our enemies term us.Our swords are
drawn for recovery of a birthright wrested from us; your Grace's
moderation and good sense has admitted the general justice of our
demand,--a demand which would never have been listened to had it not been
accompanied with the sound of the trumpet.We cannot, therefore, and dare
not, lay down our arms, even on your Grace's assurance of indemnity,
unless it were accompanied with some reasonable prospect of the redress
of the wrongs which we complain of.""Mr Morton," replied the Duke, "you are young, but you must have seen
enough of the world to perceive, that requests, by no means dangerous or
unreasonable in themselves, may become so by the way in which they are
pressed and supported.""We may reply, my lord," answered Morton, "that this disagreeable mode
has not been resorted to until all others have failed.""Mr Morton," said the Duke, "I must break this conference short.We are
in readiness to commence the attack; yet I will suspend it for an hour,
until you can communicate my answer to the insurgents.If they please to
disperse their followers, lay down their arms, and send a peaceful
deputation to me, I will consider myself bound in honour to do all I can
to procure redress of their grievances; if not, let them stand on their
guard and expect the consequences.--I think, gentlemen," he added,
turning to his two colleagues, "this is the utmost length to which I can
stretch my instructions in favour of these misguided persons?""By my faith," answered Dalzell, suddenly, "and it is a length to which
my poor judgment durst not have stretched them, considering I had both
the King and my conscience to answer to!But, doubtless, your Grace knows
more of the King's private mind than we, who have only the letter of our
instructions to look to.""You hear," he said, addressing Morton, "General
Dalzell blames me for the length which I am disposed to go in your
favour.""General Dalzell's sentiments, my lord," replied Morton, "are such as we
expected from him; your Grace's such as we were prepared to hope you
might please to entertain.Indeed I cannot help adding, that, in the case
of the absolute submission upon which you are pleased to insist, it might
still remain something less than doubtful how far, with such counsellors
around the King, even your Grace's intercession might procure us
effectual relief.But I will communicate to our leaders your Grace's
answer to our supplication; and, since we cannot obtain peace, we must
bid war welcome as well as we may.""Good morning, sir," said the Duke; "I suspend the movements of attack
for one hour, and for one hour only.If you have an answer to return
within that space of time, I will receive it here, and earnestly entreat
it may be such as to save the effusion of blood."At this moment another smile of deep meaning passed between Dalzell and
Claverhouse.The Duke observed it, and repeated his words with great
dignity."Yes, gentlemen, I said I trusted the answer might be such as would save
the effusion of blood.I hope the sentiment neither needs your scorn, nor
incurs your displeasure."Dalzell returned the Duke's frown with a stern glance, but made no
answer.Claverhouse, his lip just curled with an ironical smile, bowed,
and said, "It was not for him to judge the propriety of his Grace's
sentiments."The Duke made a signal to Morton to withdraw.He obeyed; and, accompanied
by his former escort, rode slowly through the army to return to the camp
of the non-conformists.As he passed the fine corps of Life-Guards, he
found Claverhouse was already at their head.That officer no sooner saw
Morton, than he advanced and addressed him with perfect politeness of
manner."I think this is not the first time I have seen Mr Morton of Milnwood?""It is not Colonel Grahame's fault," said Morton, smiling sternly, "that
he or any one else should be now incommoded by my presence.""Allow me at least to say," replied Claverhouse, "that Mr Morton's
present situation authorizes the opinion I have entertained of him, and
that my proceedings at our last meeting only squared to my duty.""To reconcile your actions to your duty, and your duty to your
conscience, is your business, Colonel Grahame, not mine," said Morton,
justly offended at being thus, in a manner, required to approve of the
sentence under which he had so nearly suffered."Nay, but stay an instant," said Claverhouse; "Evandale insists that I
have some wrongs to acquit myself of in your instance.I trust I shall
always make some difference between a high-minded gentleman, who, though
misguided, acts upon generous principles, and the crazy fanatical clowns
yonder, with the bloodthirsty assassins who head them.Therefore, if they
do not disperse upon your return, let me pray you instantly come over to
our army and surrender yourself, for, be assured, they cannot stand our
assault for half an hour.If you will be ruled and do this, be sure to
enquire for me.Monmouth, strange as it may seem, cannot protect
you--Dalzell will not--I both can and will; and I have promised to
Evandale to do so if you will give me an opportunity.""I should owe Lord Evandale my thanks," answered Morton, coldly, "did not
his scheme imply an opinion that I might be prevailed on to desert those
with whom I am engaged.For you, Colonel Grahame, if you will honour me
with a different species of satisfaction, it is probable, that, in an
hour's time, you will find me at the west end of Bothwell Bridge with my
sword in my hand.""I shall be happy to meet you there," said Claverhouse, "but still more
so should you think better on my first proposal.""That is a pretty lad, Lumley," said Claverhouse, addressing himself to
the other officer; "but he is a lost man--his blood be upon his head."So saying, he addressed himself to the task of preparation for instant
battle.CHAPTER X.

               But, hark!the tent has changed its voice,
               There's peace and rest nae langer.The Lowdien Mallisha they
               Came with their coats of blew;
               Five hundred men from London came,
               Claid in a reddish hue.When Morton had left the well-ordered outposts of the regular army, and
arrived at those which were maintained by his own party, he could not but
be peculiarly sensible of the difference of discipline, and entertain a
proportional degree of fear for the consequences.The same discords which
agitated the counsels of the insurgents, raged even among their meanest
followers; and their picquets and patrols were more interested and
occupied in disputing the true occasion and causes of wrath, and defining
the limits of Erastian heresy, than in looking out for and observing the
motions of their enemies, though within hearing of the royal drums and
trumpets.There was a guard, however, of the insurgent army, posted at the long and
narrow bridge of Bothwell, over which the enemy must necessarily advance
to the attack; but, like the others, they were divided and disheartened;
and, entertaining the idea that they were posted on a desperate service,
they even meditated withdrawing themselves to the main body.This would
have been utter ruin; for, on the defence or loss of this pass the
fortune of the day was most likely to depend.All beyond the bridge was a
plain open field, excepting a few thickets of no great depth, and,
consequently, was ground on which the undisciplined forces of the
insurgents, deficient as they were in cavalry, and totally unprovided
with artillery, were altogether unlikely to withstand the shock of
regular troops.Morton, therefore, viewed the pass carefully, and formed the hope, that
by occupying two or three houses on the left bank of the river, with the
copse and thickets of alders and hazels that lined its side, and by
blockading the passage itself, and shutting the gates of a portal, which,
according to the old fashion, was built on the central arch of the bridge
of Bothwell, it might be easily defended against a very superior force.He issued directions accordingly, and commanded the parapets of the
bridge, on the farther side of the portal, to be thrown down, that they
might afford no protection to the enemy when they should attempt the
passage.Morton then conjured the party at this important post to be
watchful and upon their guard, and promised them a speedy and strong
reinforcement.He caused them to advance videttes beyond the river to
watch the progress of the enemy, which outposts he directed should be
withdrawn to the left bank as soon as they approached; finally, he
charged them to send regular information to the main body of all that
they should observe.Men under arms, and in a situation of danger, are
usually sufficiently alert in appreciating the merit of their officers.Morton's intelligence and activity gained the confidence of these men,
and with better hope and heart than before, they began to fortify their
position in the manner he recommended, and saw him depart with three loud
cheers.Morton now galloped hastily towards the main body of the insurgents, but
was surprised and shocked at the scene of confusion and clamour which it
exhibited, at the moment when good order and concord were of such
essential consequence.Instead of being drawn up in line of battle, and
listening to the commands of their officers, they were crowding together
in a confused mass, that rolled and agitated itself like the waves of the
sea, while a thousand tongues spoke, or rather vociferated, and not a
single ear was found to listen.Scandalized at a scene so extraordinary,
Morton endeavoured to make his way through the press to learn, and, if
possible, to remove, the cause of this so untimely disorder.While he is
thus engaged, we shall make the reader acquainted with that which he was
some time in discovering.The insurgents had proceeded to hold their day of humiliation, which,
agreeably to the practice of the puritans during the earlier civil war,
they considered as the most effectual mode of solving all difficulties,
and waiving all discussions.It was usual to name an ordinary week-day
for this purpose, but on this occasion the Sabbath itself was adopted,
owing to the pressure of the time and the vicinity of the enemy.A
temporary pulpit, or tent, was erected in the middle of the encampment;
which, according to the fixed arrangement, was first to be occupied by
the Reverend Peter Poundtext, to whom the post of honour was assigned, as
the eldest clergyman present.But as the worthy divine, with slow and
stately steps, was advancing towards the rostrum which had been prepared
for him, he was prevented by the unexpected apparition of Habakkuk
Mucklewrath, the insane preacher, whose appearance had so much startled
Morton at the first council of the insurgents after their victory at
Loudon-hill.It is not known whether he was acting under the influence
and instigation of the Cameronians, or whether he was merely compelled by
his own agitated imagination, and the temptation of a vacant pulpit
before him, to seize the opportunity of exhorting so respectable a
congregation.It is only certain that he took occasion by the forelock,
sprung into the pulpit, cast his eyes wildly round him, and, undismayed
by the murmurs of many of the audience, opened the Bible, read forth as
his text from the thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, "Certain men, the
children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the
inhabitants of their city, saying, let us go and serve other gods, which
you have not known;" and then rushed at once into the midst of his
subject.The harangue of Mucklewrath was as wild and extravagant as his intrusion
was unauthorized and untimely; but it was provokingly coherent, in so far
as it turned entirely upon the very subjects of discord, of which it had
been agreed to adjourn the consideration until some more suitable
opportunity.Not a single topic did he omit which had offence in it; and,
after charging the moderate party with heresy, with crouching to tyranny,
with seeking to be at peace with God's enemies, he applied to Morton, by
name, the charge that he had been one of those men of Belial, who, in the
words of his text, had gone out from amongst them, to withdraw the
inhabitants of his city, and to go astray after false gods.To him, and
all who followed him, or approved of his conduct, Mucklewrath denounced
fury and vengeance, and exhorted those who would hold themselves pure and
undefiled to come up from the midst of them."Fear not," he said, "because of the neighing of horses, or the
glittering of breastplates.Seek not aid of the Egyptians, because of the
enemy, though they may be numerous as locusts, and fierce as dragons.Their trust is not as our trust, nor their rock as our rock; how else
shall a thousand fly before one, and two put ten thousand to the flight!I dreamed it in the visions of the night, and the voice said, 'Habakkuk,
take thy fan and purge the wheat from the chaff, that they be not both
consumed with the fire of indignation and the lightning of fury.'Wherefore, I say, take this Henry Morton--this wretched Achan, who hath
brought the accursed thing among ye, and made himself brethren in the
camp of the enemy--take him and stone him with stones, and thereafter
burn him with fire, that the wrath may depart from the children of the
Covenant.He hath not taken a Babylonish garment, but he hath sold the
garment of righteousness to the woman of Babylon--he hath not taken two
hundred shekels of fine silver, but he hath bartered the truth, which is
more precious than shekels of silver or wedges of gold."At this furious charge, brought so unexpectedly against one of their most
active commanders, the audience broke out into open tumult, some
demanding that there should instantly be a new election of officers, into
which office none should hereafter be admitted who had, in their phrase,
touched of that which was accursed, or temporized more or less with the
heresies and corruptions of the times.While such was the demand of the
Cameronians, they vociferated loudly, that those who were not with them
were against them,--that it was no time to relinquish the substantial
part of the covenanted testimony of the Church, if they expected a
blessing on their arms and their cause; and that, in their eyes, a
lukewarm Presbyterian was little better than a Prelatist, an
Anti-Covenanter, and a Nullifidian.The parties accused repelled the charge of criminal compliance and
defection from the truth with scorn and indignation, and charged their
accusers with breach of faith, as well as with wrong-headed and
extravagant zeal in introducing such divisions into an army, the joint
strength of which could not, by the most sanguine, be judged more than
sufficient to face their enemies.Poundtext, and one or two others, made
some faint efforts to stem the increasing fury of the factious,
exclaiming to those of the other party, in the words of the
Patriarch,--"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee,
and between thy herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we be brethren."No
pacific overture could possibly obtain audience.It was in vain that
even Burley himself, when he saw the dissension proceed to such ruinous
lengths, exerted his stern and deep voice, commanding silence and
obedience to discipline.The spirit of insubordination had gone forth,
and it seemed as if the exhortation of Habakkuk Mucklewrath had
communicated a part of his frenzy to all who heard him.The wiser, or
more timid part of the assembly, were already withdrawing themselves
from the field, and giving up their cause as lost.Others were
moderating a harmonious call, as they somewhat improperly termed it, to
new officers, and dismissing those formerly chosen, and that with a
tumult and clamour worthy of the deficiency of good sense and good order
implied in the whole transaction.It was at this moment when Morton
arrived in the field and joined the army, in total confusion, and on the
point of dissolving itself.His arrival occasioned loud exclamations of
applause on the one side, and of imprecation on the other."What means this ruinous disorder at such a moment?"he exclaimed to
Burley, who, exhausted with his vain exertions to restore order, was now
leaning on his sword, and regarding the confusion with an eye of resolute
despair."It means," he replied, "that God has delivered us into the hands of our
enemies.""Not so," answered Morton, with a voice and gesture which compelled many
to listen; "it is not God who deserts us, it is we who desert him, and
dishonour ourselves by disgracing and betraying the cause of freedom and
religion.--Hear me," he exclaimed, springing to the pulpit which
Mucklewrath had been compelled to evacuate by actual exhaustion--"I bring
from the enemy an offer to treat, if you incline to lay down your arms.I
can assure you the means of making an honourable defence, if you are of
more manly tempers.Let us resolve either for
peace or war; and let it not be said of us in future days, that six
thousand Scottish men in arms had neither courage to stand their ground
and fight it out, nor prudence to treat for peace, nor even the coward's
wisdom to retreat in good time and with safety.What signifies
quarrelling on minute points of church-discipline, when the whole edifice
is threatened with total destruction?O, remember, my brethren, that the
last and worst evil which God brought upon the people whom he had once
chosen--the last and worst punishment of their blindness and hardness of
heart, was the bloody dissensions which rent asunder their city, even
when the enemy were thundering at its gates!"Some of the audience testified their feeling of this exhortation, by loud
exclamations of applause; others by hooting, and exclaiming--"To your
tents, O Israel!"Morton, who beheld the columns of the enemy already beginning to appear
on the right bank, and directing their march upon the bridge, raised his
voice to its utmost pitch, and, pointing at the same time with his hand,
exclaimed,--"Silence your senseless clamours, yonder is the enemy!On
maintaining the bridge against him depend our lives, as well as our hope
to reclaim our laws and liberties.--There shall at least one Scottishman
die in their defence.--Let any one who loves his country follow me!"The multitude had turned their heads in the direction to which he
pointed.The sight of the glittering files of the English Foot-Guards,
supported by several squadrons of horse, of the cannon which the
artillerymen were busily engaged in planting against the bridge, of the
plaided clans who seemed to search for a ford, and of the long succession
of troops which were destined to support the attack, silenced at once
their clamorous uproar, and struck them with as much consternation as if
it were an unexpected apparition, and not the very thing which they ought
to have been looking out for.They gazed on each other, and on their
leaders, with looks resembling those that indicate the weakness of a
patient when exhausted by a fit of frenzy.Yet when Morton, springing
from the rostrum, directed his steps towards the bridge, he was followed
by about an hundred of the young men who were particularly attached to
his command.Burley turned to Macbriar--"Ephraim," he said, "it is Providence points
us the way, through the worldly wisdom of this latitudinarian youth.--He
that loves the light, let him follow Burley!""Tarry," replied Macbriar; "it is not by Henry Morton, or such as he,
that our goings-out and our comings-in are to be meted; therefore tarry
with us.I fear treachery to the host from this nullifidian Achan--Thou
shalt not go with him.Thou art our chariots and our horsemen.""Hinder me not," replied Burley; "he hath well said that all is lost, if
the enemy win the bridge--therefore let me not.Shall the children of
this generation be called wiser or braver than the children of the
sanctuary?--Array yourselves under your leaders--let us not lack supplies
of men and ammunition; and accursed be he who turneth back from the work
on this great day!"Having thus spoken, he hastily marched towards the bridge, and was
followed by about two hundred of the most gallant and zealous of his
party.There was a deep and disheartened pause when Morton and Burley
departed.The commanders availed themselves of it to display their lines
in some sort of order, and exhorted those who were most exposed to throw
themselves upon their faces to avoid the cannonade which they might
presently expect.The insurgents ceased to resist or to remonstrate; but
the awe which had silenced their discords had dismayed their courage.They suffered themselves to be formed into ranks with the docility of a
flock of sheep, but without possessing, for the time, more resolution or
energy; for they experienced a sinking of the heart, imposed by the
sudden and imminent approach of the danger which they had neglected to
provide against while it was yet distant.They were, however, drawn out
with some regularity; and as they still possessed the appearance of an
army, their leaders had only to hope that some favourable circumstance
would restore their spirits and courage.Kettledrummle, Poundtext, Macbriar, and other preachers, busied
themselves in their ranks, and prevailed on them to raise a psalm.But
the superstitious among them observed, as an ill omen, that their song of
praise and triumph sunk into "a quaver of consternation," and resembled
rather a penitentiary stave sung on the scaffold of a condemned criminal,
than the bold strain which had resounded along the wild heath of
Loudon-hill, in anticipation of that day's victory.The melancholy melody
soon received a rough accompaniment; the royal soldiers shouted, the
Highlanders yelled, the cannon began to fire on one side, and the
musketry on both, and the bridge of Bothwell, with the banks adjacent,
were involved in wreaths of smoke.As e'er ye saw the rain doun fa',
                    Or yet the arrow from the bow,
                    Sae our Scots lads fell even down,
                    And they lay slain on every knowe.Ere Morton or Burley had reached the post to be defended, the enemy had
commenced an attack upon it with great spirit.The two regiments of
Foot-Guards, formed into a close column, rushed forward to the river; one
corps, deploying along the right bank, commenced a galling fire on the
defenders of the pass, while the other pressed on to occupy the bridge.The insurgents sustained the attack with great constancy and courage; and
while part of their number returned the fire across the river, the rest
maintained a discharge of musketry upon the further end of the bridge
itself, and every avenue by which the soldiers endeavoured to approach
it.The latter suffered severely, but still gained ground, and the head
of their column was already upon the bridge, when the arrival of Morton
changed the scene; and his marksmen, commencing upon the pass a fire as
well aimed as it was sustained and regular, compelled the assailants to
retire with much loss.They were a second time brought up to the charge,
and a second time repulsed with still greater loss, as Burley had now
brought his party into action.The fire was continued with the utmost
vehemence on both sides, and the issue of the action seemed very dubious.Monmouth, mounted on a superb white charger, might be discovered on the
top of the right bank of the river, urging, entreating, and animating the
exertions of his soldiers.By his orders, the cannon, which had hitherto
been employed in annoying the distant main body of the presbyterians,
were now turned upon the defenders of the bridge.But these tremendous
engines, being wrought much more slowly than in modern times, did not
produce the effect of annoying or terrifying the enemy to the extent
proposed.The insurgents, sheltered by copsewood along the bank of the
river, or stationed in the houses already mentioned, fought under cover,
while the royalists, owing to the precautions of Morton, were entirely
exposed.The defence was so protracted and obstinate, that the royal
generals began to fear it might be ultimately successful.While Monmouth
threw himself from his horse, and, rallying the Foot-Guards, brought them
on to another close and desperate attack, he was warmly seconded
by Dalzell, who, putting himself at the head of a body of
Lennox-Highlanders, rushed forward with their tremendous war-cry of
Loch-sloy.[Note: This was the slogan or war-cry of the MacFarlanes, taken from
     a lake near the head of Loch Lomond, in the centre of their ancient
     possessions on the western banks of that beautiful inland sea.]The ammunition of the defenders of the bridge began to fail at this
important crisis; messages, commanding and imploring succours and
supplies, were in vain dispatched, one after the other, to the main body
of the presbyterian army, which remained inactively drawn up on the open
fields in the rear.Fear, consternation, and misrule, had gone abroad
among them, and while the post on which their safety depended required
to be instantly and powerfully reinforced, there remained none either to
command or to obey.As the fire of the defenders of the bridge began to slacken, that of the
assailants increased, and in its turn became more fatal.Animated by the
example and exhortations of their generals, they obtained a footing upon
the bridge itself, and began to remove the obstacles by which it was
blockaded.The portal-gate was broke open, the beams, trunks of trees,
and other materials of the barricade, pulled down and thrown into the
river.Morton and Burley
fought in the very front of their followers, and encouraged them with
their pikes, halberds, and partisans, to encounter the bayonets of the
Guards, and the broadswords of the Highlanders.But those behind the
leaders began to shrink from the unequal combat, and fly singly, or in
parties of two or three, towards the main body, until the remainder were,
by the mere weight of the hostile column as much as by their weapons,
fairly forced from the bridge.The passage being now open, the enemy
began to pour over.But the bridge was long and narrow, which rendered
the manoeuvre slow as well as dangerous; and those who first passed had
still to force the houses, from the windows of which the Covenanters
continued to fire.Burley and Morton were near each other at this
critical moment."There is yet time," said the former, "to bring down horse to attack
them, ere they can get into order; and, with the aid of God, we may thus
regain the bridge--hasten thou to bring them down, while I make the
defence good with this old and wearied body."Morton saw the importance of the advice, and, throwing himself on the
horse which cuddie held in readiness for him behind the thicket, galloped
towards a body of cavalry which chanced to be composed entirely of
Cameronians.Ere he could speak his errand, or utter his orders, he was
saluted by the execrations of the whole body.they exclaimed--"the cowardly traitor flies like a hart from
the hunters, and hath left valiant Burley in the midst of the slaughter!""I come to lead you to the attack.Advance
boldly, and we shall yet do well."--such were the tumultuous exclamations
which resounded from the ranks;--"he hath sold you to the sword of the
enemy!"And while Morton argued, entreated, and commanded in vain, the moment was
lost in which the advance might have been useful; and the outlet from the
bridge, with all its defences, being in complete possession of the enemy,
Burley and his remaining followers were driven back upon the main body,
to whom the spectacle of their hurried and harassed retreat was far from
restoring the confidence which they so much wanted.In the meanwhile, the forces of the King crossed the bridge at their
leisure, and, securing the pass, formed in line of battle; while
Claverhouse, who, like a hawk perched on a rock, and eyeing the time to
pounce on its prey, had watched the event of the action from the opposite
bank, now passed the bridge at the head of his cavalry, at full trot,
and, leading them in squadrons through the intervals and round the flanks
of the royal infantry, formed them in line on the moor, and led them to
the charge, advancing in front with one large body, while other two
divisions threatened the flanks of the Covenanters.Their devoted army
was now in that situation when the slightest demonstration towards an
attack was certain to inspire panic.Their broken spirits and
disheartened courage were unable to endure the charge of the cavalry,
attended with all its terrible accompaniments of sight and sound;--the
rush of the horses at full speed, the shaking of the earth under their
feet, the glancing of the swords, the waving of the plumes, and the
fierce shouts of the cavaliers.The front ranks hardly attempted one
ill-directed and disorderly fire, and their rear were broken and flying
in confusion ere the charge had been completed; and in less than five
minutes the horsemen were mixed with them, cutting and hewing without
mercy.The voice of Claverhouse was heard, even above the din of
conflict, exclaiming to his soldiers--"Kill, kill--no quarter--think on
Richard Grahame!"The dragoons, many of whom had shared the disgrace of
Loudon-hill, required no exhortations to vengeance as easy as it was
complete.Their swords drank deep of slaughter among the unresisting
fugitives.Screams for quarter were only answered by the shouts with
which the pursuers accompanied their blows, and the whole field presented
one general scene of confused slaughter, flight, and pursuit.About twelve hundred of the insurgents who remained in a body a little
apart from the rest, and out of the line of the charge of cavalry, threw
down their arms and surrendered at discretion, upon the approach of the
Duke of Monmouth at the head of the infantry.That mild-tempered nobleman
instantly allowed them the quarter which they prayed for; and, galloping
about through the field, exerted himself as much to stop the slaughter as
he had done to obtain the victory.While busied in this humane task he
met with General Dalzell, who was encouraging the fierce Highlanders and
royal volunteers to show their zeal for King and country, by quenching
the flame of the rebellion with the blood of the rebels."Sheathe your sword, I command you, General!"exclaimed the Duke, "and
sound the retreat.Enough of blood has been shed; give quarter to the
King's misguided subjects.""I obey your Grace," said the old man, wiping his bloody sword and
returning it to the scabbard; "but I warn you, at the same time, that
enough has not been done to intimidate these desperate rebels.Has not
your Grace heard that Basil Olifant has collected several gentlemen and
men of substance in the west, and is in the act of marching to join
them?"said the Duke; "who, or what is he?""The next male heir to the last Earl of Torwood.He is disaffected to
government from his claim to the estate being set aside in favour of Lady
Margaret Bellenden; and I suppose the hope of getting the inheritance has
set him in motion.""Be his motives what they will," replied Monmouth, "he must soon disperse
his followers, for this army is too much broken to rally again.Therefore, once more, I command that the pursuit be stopped.""It is your Grace's province to command, and to be responsible for your
commands," answered Dalzell, as he gave reluctant orders for checking the
pursuit.But the fiery and vindictive Grahame was already far out of hearing of
the signal of retreat, and continued with his cavalry an unwearied and
bloody pursuit, breaking, dispersing, and cutting to pieces all the
insurgents whom they could come up with.Burley and Morton were both hurried off the field by the confused tide of
fugitives.They made some attempt to defend the streets of the town of
Hamilton; but, while labouring to induce the fliers to face about and
stand to their weapons.Burley received a bullet which broke his
sword-arm."May the hand be withered that shot the shot!"he exclaimed, as the sword
which he was waving over his head fell powerless to his side.[Note: This incident, and Burley's exclamation, are
taken from the records.]Then turning his horse's head, he retreated out of the confusion.Morton
also now saw that the continuing his unavailing efforts to rally the
fliers could only end in his own death or captivity, and, followed by the
faithful Cuddie, he extricated himself from the press, and, being well
mounted, leaped his horse over one or two enclosures, and got into the
open country.From the first hill which they gained in their flight, they looked back,
and beheld the whole country covered with their fugitive companions, and
with the pursuing dragoons, whose wild shouts and halloo, as they did
execution on the groups whom they overtook, mingled with the groans and
screams of their victims, rose shrilly up the hill."It is impossible they can ever make head again," said Morton."The head's taen aff them, as clean as I wad bite it aff a sybo!"They'll be cunning that catches me at this wark
again.--But, for God's sake, sir, let us mak for some strength!"Morton saw the necessity of following the advice of his trusty squire.They resumed a rapid pace, and continued it without intermission,
directing their course towards the wild and mountainous country, where
they thought it likely some part of the fugitives might draw together,
for the sake either of making defence, or of obtaining terms.They require
               Of Heaven the hearts of lions, breath of tigers,
               Yea and the fierceness too.Evening had fallen; and, for the last two hours, they had seen none of
their ill-fated companions, when Morton and his faithful attendant gained
the moorland, and approached a large and solitary farmhouse, situated in
the entrance of a wild glen, far remote from any other habitation."Our horses," said Morton, "will carry us no farther without rest or
food, and we must try to obtain them here, if possible."So speaking, he led the way to the house.The place had every appearance
of being inhabited.There was smoke issuing from the chimney in a
considerable volume, and the marks of recent hoofs were visible around
the door.They could even hear the murmuring of human voices within the
house.But all the lower windows were closely secured; and when they
knocked at the door, no answer was returned.After vainly calling and
entreating admittance, they withdrew to the stable, or shed, in order to
accommodate their horses, ere they used farther means of gaining
admission.In this place they found ten or twelve horses, whose state of
fatigue, as well as the military yet disordered appearance of their
saddles and accoutrements, plainly indicated that their owners were
fugitive insurgents in their own circumstances."This meeting bodes luck," said Cuddie; "and they hae walth o' beef,
that's ae thing certain, for here's a raw hide that has been about the
hurdies o' a stot not half an hour syne--it's warm yet."Encouraged by these appearances, they returned again to the house, and,
announcing themselves as men in the same predicament with the inmates,
clamoured loudly for admittance."Whoever ye be," answered a stern voice from the window, after a long and
obdurate silence, "disturb not those who mourn for the desolation and
captivity of the land, and search out the causes of wrath and of
defection, that the stumbling-blocks may be removed over which we have
stumbled.""They are wild western whigs," said Cuddie, in a whisper to his master,
"I ken by their language.Fiend hae me, if I like to venture on them!"Morton, however, again called to the party within, and insisted on
admittance; but, finding his entreaties still disregarded, he opened one
of the lower windows, and pushing asunder the shutters, which were but
slightly secured, stepped into the large kitchen from which the voice had
issued.Cuddie followed him, muttering betwixt his teeth, as he put his
head within the window, "That he hoped there was nae scalding brose on
the fire;" and master and servant both found themselves in the company of
ten or twelve armed men, seated around the fire, on which refreshments
were preparing, and busied apparently in their devotions.In the gloomy countenances, illuminated by the fire-light, Morton had no
difficulty in recognising several of those zealots who had most
distinguished themselves by their intemperate opposition to all moderate
measures, together with their noted pastor, the fanatical Ephraim
Macbriar, and the maniac, Habakkuk Mucklewrath.The Cameronians neither
stirred tongue nor hand to welcome their brethren in misfortune, but
continued to listen to the low murmured exercise of Macbriar, as he
prayed that the Almighty would lift up his hand from his people, and not
make an end in the day of his anger.That they were conscious of the
presence of the intruders only appeared from the sullen and indignant
glances which they shot at them, from time to time, as their eyes
encountered.Morton, finding into what unfriendly society he had unwittingly intruded,
began to think of retreating; but, on turning his head, observed with
some alarm, that two strong men had silently placed themselves beside the
window, through which they had entered.One of these ominous sentinels
whispered to Cuddie, "Son of that precious woman, Mause Headrigg, do not
cast thy lot farther with this child of treachery and perdition--Pass on
thy way, and tarry not, for the avenger of blood is behind thee."With this he pointed to the window, out of which Cuddie jumped without
hesitation; for the intimation he had received plainly implied the
personal danger he would otherwise incur."Winnocks are no lucky wi' me," was his first reflection when he was in
the open air; his next was upon the probable fate of his master."They'll
kill him, the murdering loons, and think they're doing a gude turn!but
I'se tak the back road for Hamilton, and see if I canna get some o' our
ain folk to bring help in time of needcessity."So saying, Cuddie hastened to the stable, and taking the best horse he
could find instead of his own tired animal, he galloped off in the
direction he proposed.The noise of his horse's tread alarmed for an instant the devotion of the
fanatics.As it died in the distance, Macbriar brought his exercise to a
conclusion, and his audience raised themselves from the stooping posture,
and louring downward look, with which they had listened to it, and all
fixed their eyes sternly on Henry Morton."You bend strange countenances on me, gentlemen," said he, addressing
them."I am totally ignorant in what manner I can have deserved them."exclaimed Mucklewrath, starting up: "the
word that thou hast spurned shall become a rock to crush and to bruise
thee; the spear which thou wouldst have broken shall pierce thy side; we
have prayed, and wrestled, and petitioned for an offering to atone the
sins of the congregation, and lo!the very head of the offence is
delivered into our hand.He hath burst in like a thief through the
window; he is a ram caught in the thicket, whose blood shall be a
drink-offering to redeem vengeance from the church, and the place shall
from henceforth be called Jehovah-Jireh, for the sacrifice is provided.Up then, and bind the victim with cords to the horns of the altar!"There was a movement among the party; and deeply did Morton regret at
that moment the incautious haste with which he had ventured into their
company.He was armed only with his sword, for he had left his pistols at
the bow of his saddle; and, as the whigs were all provided with
fire-arms, there was little or no chance of escaping from them by
resistance.The interposition, however, of Macbriar protected him for the
moment."Tarry yet a while, brethren--let us not use the sword rashly, lest the
load of innocent blood lie heavy on us.--Come," he said, addressing
himself to Morton, "we will reckon with thee ere we avenge the cause thou
hast betrayed.--Hast thou not," he continued, "made thy face as hard as
flint against the truth in all the assemblies of the host?""He has--he has," murmured the deep voices of the assistants."He hath ever urged peace with the malignants," said one."And pleaded for the dark and dismal guilt of the Indulgence," said
another."And would have surrendered the host into the hands of Monmouth," echoed
a third; "and was the first to desert the honest and manly Burley, while
he yet resisted at the pass.I saw him on the moor, with his horse bloody
with spurring, long ere the firing had ceased at the bridge.""Gentlemen," said Morton, "if you mean to bear me down by clamour, and
take my life without hearing me, it is perhaps a thing in your power; but
you will sin before God and man by the commission of such a murder.""I say, hear the youth," said Macbriar; "for Heaven knows our bowels have
yearned for him, that he might be brought to see the truth, and exert his
gifts in its defence.But he is blinded by his carnal knowledge, and has
spurned the light when it blazed before him."Silence being obtained, Morton proceeded to assert the good faith which
he had displayed in the treaty with Monmouth, and the active part he had
borne in the subsequent action."I may not, gentlemen," he said, "be fully able to go the lengths you
desire, in assigning to those of my own religion the means of tyrannizing
over others; but none shall go farther in asserting our own lawful
freedom.And I must needs aver, that had others been of my mind in
counsel, or disposed to stand by my side in battle, we should this
evening, instead of being a defeated and discordant remnant, have
sheathed our weapons in an useful and honourable peace, or brandished
them triumphantly after a decisive victory.""He hath spoken the word," said one of the assembly--"he hath avowed his
carnal self-seeking and Erastianism; let him die the death!""Peace yet again," said Macbriar, "for I will try him further.--Was it
not by thy means that the malignant Evandale twice escaped from death and
captivity?Was it not through thee that Miles Bellenden and his garrison
of cut-throats were saved from the edge of the sword?""I am proud to say, that you have spoken the truth in both instances,"
replied Morton.you see," said Macbriar, "again hath his mouth spoken it.--And didst
thou not do this for the sake of a Midianitish woman, one of the spawn of
prelacy, a toy with which the arch-enemy's trap is baited?Didst thou not
do all this for the sake of Edith Bellenden?""You are incapable," answered Morton, boldly, "of appreciating my
feelings towards that young lady; but all that I have done I would have
done had she never existed.""Thou art a hardy rebel to the truth," said another dark-brow'd man; "and
didst thou not so act, that, by conveying away the aged woman, Margaret
Bellenden, and her grand-daughter, thou mightest thwart the wise and
godly project of John Balfour of Burley for bringing forth to battle
Basil Olifant, who had agreed to take the field if he were insured
possession of these women's worldly endowments?""I never heard of such a scheme," said Morton, "and therefore I could not
thwart it.--But does your religion permit you to take such uncreditable
and immoral modes of recruiting?""Peace," said Macbriar, somewhat disconcerted; "it is not for thee to
instruct tender professors, or to construe Covenant obligations.For the
rest, you have acknowledged enough of sin and sorrowful defection, to
draw down defeat on a host, were it as numerous as the sands on the
sea-shore.And it is our judgment, that we are not free to let you pass
from us safe and in life, since Providence hath given you into our hands
at the moment that we prayed with godly Joshua, saying, 'What shall we
say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?'--Then camest
thou, delivered to us as it were by lot, that thou mightest sustain the
punishment of one that hath wrought folly in Israel.This is the Sabbath, and our hand shall not be on thee to spill
thy blood upon this day; but, when the twelfth hour shall strike, it is a
token that thy time on earth hath run!Wherefore improve thy span, for it
flitteth fast away.--Seize on the prisoner, brethren, and take his
weapon."The command was so unexpectedly given, and so suddenly executed by those
of the party who had gradually closed behind and around Morton, that he
was overpowered, disarmed, and a horse-girth passed round his arms,
before he could offer any effectual resistance.When this was
accomplished, a dead and stern silence took place.The fanatics ranged
themselves around a large oaken table, placing Morton amongst them bound
and helpless, in such a manner as to be opposite to the clock which was
to strike his knell.Food was placed before them, of which they offered
their intended victim a share; but, it will readily be believed, he had
little appetite.When this was removed, the party resumed their
devotions.Macbriar, whose fierce zeal did not perhaps exclude some
feelings of doubt and compunction, began to expostulate in prayer, as if
to wring from the Deity a signal that the bloody sacrifice they proposed
was an acceptable service.The eyes and ears of his hearers were
anxiously strained, as if to gain some sight or sound which might be
converted or wrested into a type of approbation, and ever and anon dark
looks were turned on the dial-plate of the time-piece, to watch its
progress towards the moment of execution.Morton's eye frequently took the same course, with the sad reflection,
that there appeared no posibility of his life being expanded beyond the
narrow segment which the index had yet to travel on the circle until it
arrived at the fatal hour.Faith in his religion, with a constant
unyielding principle of honour, and the sense of conscious innocence,
enabled him to pass through this dreadful interval with less agitation
than he himself could have expected, had the situation been prophesied to
him.Yet there was a want of that eager and animating sense of right
which supported him in similar circumstances, when in the power of
Claverhouse.Then he was conscious, that, amid the spectators, were many
who were lamenting his condition, and some who applauded his conduct.But
now, among these pale-eyed and ferocious zealots, whose hardened brows
were soon to be bent, not merely with indifference, but with triumph,
upon his execution,--without a friend to speak a kindly word, or give a
look either of sympathy or encouragement,--awaiting till the sword
destined to slay him crept out of the scabbard gradually, and as it were
by strawbreadths, and condemned to drink the bitterness of death drop by
drop,--it is no wonder that his feelings were less composed than they had
been on any former occasion of danger.His destined executioners, as he
gazed around them, seemed to alter their forms and features, like
spectres in a feverish dream; their figures became larger, and their
faces more disturbed; and, as an excited imagination predominated over
the realities which his eyes received, he could have thought himself
surrounded rather by a band of demons than of human beings; the walls
seemed to drop with blood, and the light tick of the clock thrilled on
his ear with such loud, painful distinctness, as if each sound were the
prick of a bodkin inflicted on the naked nerve of the organ.[Illustration: Morton Awaiting Death--frontispiece2]


It was with pain that he felt his mind wavering, while on the brink
between this and the future world.He made a strong effort to compose
himself to devotional exercises, and unequal, during that fearful strife
of nature, to arrange his own thoughts into suitable expressions, he had,
instinctively, recourse to the petition for deliverance and for composure
of spirit which is to be found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church
of England.Macbriar, whose family were of that persuasion, instantly
recognised the words, which the unfortunate prisoner pronounced half
aloud."There lacked but this," he said, his pale cheek kindling with
resentment, "to root out my carnal reluctance to see his blood spilt.He
is a prelatist, who has sought the camp under the disguise of an
Erastian, and all, and more than all, that has been said of him must
needs be verity.His blood be on his head, the deceiver!--let him go down
to Tophet, with the ill-mumbled mass which he calls a prayer-book, in his
right hand!""As the sun went
back on the dial ten degrees for intimating the recovery of holy
Hezekiah, so shall it now go forward, that the wicked may be taken away
from among the people, and the Covenant established in its purity."He sprang to a chair with an attitude of frenzy, in order to anticipate
the fatal moment by putting the index forward; and several of the party
began to make ready their slaughter-weapons for immediate execution, when
Mucklewrath's hand was arrested by one of his companions.he said--"I hear a distant noise.""It is the rushing of the brook over the pebbles," said one."It is the sough of the wind among the bracken," said another."It is the galloping of horse," said Morton to himself, his sense of
hearing rendered acute by the dreadful situation in which he stood; "God
grant they may come as my deliverers!"The noise approached rapidly, and became more and more distinct."It is horse," cried Macbriar."Look out and descry who they are."cried one who had opened the window, in
obedience to his order.A thick trampling and loud voices were heard immediately round the house.Some rose to resist, and some to escape; the doors and windows were
forced at once, and the red coats of the troopers appeared in the
apartment."Have at the bloody rebels!--Remember Cornet Grahame!"The lights were struck down, but the dubious glare of the fire enabled
them to continue the fray.Several pistol-shots were fired; the whig who
stood next to Morton received a shot as he was rising, stumbled against
the prisoner, whom he bore down with his weight, and lay stretched above
him a dying man.This accident probably saved Morton from the damage he
might otherwise have received in so close a struggle, where fire-arms
were discharged and sword-blows given for upwards of five minutes.exclaimed the well-known voice of Claverhouse;
"look about for him, and dispatch the whig dog who is groaning there."Mary journeyed to the office.The groans of the wounded man were silenced by
a thrust with a rapier, and Morton, disencumbered of his weight, was
speedily raised and in the arms of the faithful Cuddie, who blubbered for
joy when he found that the blood with which his master was covered had
not flowed from his own veins.A whisper in Morton's ear, while his
trusty follower relieved him from his bonds, explained the secret of the
very timely appearance of the soldiers."I fell into Claverhouse's party when I was seeking for some o' our ain
folk to help ye out o' the hands of the whigs, sae being atween the deil
and the deep sea, I e'en thought it best to bring him on wi' me, for
he'll be wearied wi' felling folk the night, and the morn's a new day,
and Lord Evandale awes ye a day in ha'arst; and Monmouth gies quarter,
the dragoons tell me, for the asking.Sae haud up your heart, an' I'se
warrant we'll do a' weel eneugh yet."The principal incident of the foregoing
     Chapter was suggested by an occurrence of a similar kind, told me by
     a gentleman, now deceased, who held an important situation in the
     Excise, to which he had been raised by active and resolute exertions
     in an inferior department.When employed as a supervisor on the
     coast of Galloway, at a time when the immunities of the Isle of Man
     rendered smuggling almost universal in that district, this gentleman
     had the fortune to offend highly several of the leaders in the
     contraband trade, by his zeal in serving the revenue.This rendered his situation a dangerous one, and, on more than one
     occasion, placed his life in jeopardy.At one time in particular, as
     he was riding after sunset on a summer evening, he came suddenly
     upon a gang of the most desperate smugglers in that part of the
     country.They surrounded him, without violence, but in such a manner
     as to show that it would be resorted to if he offered resistance,
     and gave him to understand he must spend the evening with them,
     since they had met so happily.The officer did not attempt
     opposition, but only asked leave to send a country lad to tell his
     wife and family that he should be detained later than he expected.As he had to charge the boy with this message in the presence of the
     smugglers, he could found no hope of deliverance from it, save what
     might arise from the sharpness of the lad's observation, and the
     natural anxiety and affection of his wife.But if his errand should
     be delivered and received literally, as he was conscious the
     smugglers expected, it was likely that it might, by suspending alarm
     about his absence from home, postpone all search after him till it
     might be useless.Making a merit of necessity, therefore, he
     instructed and dispatched his messenger, and went with the
     contraband traders, with seeming willingness, to one of their
     ordinary haunts.He sat down at table with them, and they began to
     drink and indulge themselves in gross jokes, while, like Mirabel in
     the "Inconstant," their prisoner had the heavy task of receiving
     their insolence as wit, answering their insults with good-humour,
     and withholding from them the opportunity which they sought of
     engaging him in a quarrel, that they might have a pretence for
     misusing him.He succeeded for some time, but soon became satisfied
     it was their purpose to murder him out-right, or else to beat him in
     such a manner as scarce to leave him with life.A regard for the
     sanctity of the Sabbath evening, which still oddly subsisted among
     these ferocious men, amidst their habitual violation of divine and
     social law, prevented their commencing their intended cruelty until
     the Sabbath should be terminated.They were sitting around their
     anxious prisoner, muttering to each other words of terrible import,
     and watching the index of a clock, which was shortly to strike the
     hour at which, in their apprehension, murder would become lawful,
     when their intended victim heard a distant rustling like the wind
     among withered leaves.It came nearer, and resembled the sound of a
     brook in flood chafing within its banks; it came nearer yet, and was
     plainly distinguished as the galloping of a party of horse.The
     absence of her husband, and the account given by the boy of the
     suspicious appearance of those with whom he had remained, had
     induced Mrs--to apply to the neighbouring town for a party of
     dragoons, who thus providentially arrived in time to save him from
     extreme violence, if not from actual destruction.]Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!To all the sensual world proclaim,
               One crowded hour of glorious life
               Is worth an age without a name.When the desperate affray had ceased, Claverhouse commanded his soldiers
to remove the dead bodies, to refresh themselves and their horses, and
prepare for passing the night at the farm-house, and for marching early
in the ensuing morning.He then turned his attention to Morton, and there
was politeness, and even kindness, in the manner in which he addressed
him."You would have saved yourself risk from both sides, Mr Morton, if you
had honoured my counsel yesterday morning with some attention; but I
respect your motives.You are a prisoner-of-war at the disposal of the
king and council, but you shall be treated with no incivility; and I will
be satisfied with your parole that you will not attempt an escape."When Morton had passed his word to that effect, Claverhouse bowed
civilly, and, turning away from him, called for his sergeant-major."How many prisoners, Halliday, and how many killed?""Three killed in the house, sir, two cut down in the court, and one in
the garden--six in all; four prisoners.""Three of them armed to the teeth," answered Halliday; "one without
arms--he seems to be a preacher.""Ay--the trumpeter to the long-ear'd rout, I suppose," replied
Claverhouse, glancing slightly round upon his victims, "I will talk with
him tomorrow.Take the other three down to the yard, draw out two files,
and fire upon them; and, d'ye hear, make a memorandum in the orderly book
of three rebels taken in arms and shot, with the date and name of the
place--Drumshinnel, I think, they call it.--Look after the preacher till
to-morrow; as he was not armed, he must undergo a short examination.Or
better, perhaps, take him before the Privy Council; I think they should
relieve me of a share of this disgusting drudgery.--Let Mr Morton be
civilly used, and see that the men look well after their horses; and let
my groom wash Wild-blood's shoulder with some vinegar, the saddle has
touched him a little."All these various orders,--for life and death, the securing of his
prisoners, and the washing his charger's shoulder,--were given in the
same unmoved and equable voice, of which no accent or tone intimated that
the speaker considered one direction as of more importance than another.The Cameronians, so lately about to be the willing agents of a bloody
execution, were now themselves to undergo it.They seemed prepared alike
for either extremity, nor did any of them show the least sign of fear,
when ordered to leave the room for the purpose of meeting instant death.Their severe enthusiasm sustained them in that dreadful moment, and they
departed with a firm look and in silence, excepting that one of them, as
he left the apartment, looked Claverhouse full in the face, and
pronounced, with a stern and steady voice,--"Mischief shall haunt the
violent man!"to which Grahame only answered by a smile of contempt.They had no sooner left the room than Claverhouse applied himself to some
food, which one or two of his party had hastily provided, and invited
Morton to follow his example, observing, it had been a busy day for them
both.Morton declined eating; for the sudden change of circumstances--the
transition from the verge of the grave to a prospect of life, had
occasioned a dizzy revulsion in his whole system.But the same confused
sensation was accompanied by a burning thirst, and he expressed his wish
to drink."I will pledge you, with all my heart," said Claverhouse; "for here is a
black jack full of ale, and good it must be, if there be good in the
country, for the whigs never miss to find it out.--My service to you, Mr
Morton," he said, filling one horn of ale for himself, and handing
another to his prisoner.Morton raised it to his head, and was just about to drink, when the
discharge of carabines beneath the window, followed by a deep and hollow
groan, repeated twice or thrice, and more faint at each interval,
announced the fate of the three men who had just left them.Morton
shuddered, and set down the untasted cup."You are but young in these matters, Mr Morton," said Claverhouse, after
he had very composedly finished his draught; "and I do not think the
worse of you as a young soldier for appearing to feel them acutely.But
habit, duty, and necessity, reconcile men to every thing.""I trust," said Morton, "they will never reconcile me to such scenes as
these.""You would hardly believe," said Claverhouse in reply, "that, in the
beginning of my military career, I had as much aversion to seeing blood
spilt as ever man felt; it seemed to me to be wrung from my own heart;
and yet, if you trust one of those whig fellows, he will tell you I drink
a warm cup of it every morning before I breakfast.[Note: The author is
uncertain whether this was ever said of Claverhouse.But it was currently
reported of Sir Robert Grierson of Lagg, another of the persecutors, that
a cup of wine placed in his hand turned to clotted blood.]But in truth,
Mr Morton, why should we care so much for death, light upon us or around
us whenever it may?Men die daily--not a bell tolls the hour but it is
the death-note of some one or other; and why hesitate to shorten the span
of others, or take over-anxious care to prolong our own?It is all a
lottery--when the hour of midnight came, you were to die--it has struck,
you are alive and safe, and the lot has fallen on those fellows who were
to murder you.It is not the expiring pang that is worth thinking of in
an event that must happen one day, and may befall us on any given
moment--it is the memory which the soldier leaves behind him, like the
long train of light that follows the sunken sun--that is all which is
worth caring for, which distinguishes the death of the brave or the
ignoble.When I think of death, Mr Morton, as a thing worth thinking of,
it is in the hope of pressing one day some well-fought and hard-won
field of battle, and dying with the shout of victory in my ear--that
would be worth dying for, and more, it would be worth having lived for!"At the moment when Grahame delivered these sentiments, his eye glancing
with the martial enthusiasm which formed such a prominent feature in his
character, a gory figure, which seemed to rise out of the floor of the
apartment, stood upright before him, and presented the wild person and
hideous features of the maniac so often mentioned.His face, where it was
not covered with blood-streaks, was ghastly pale, for the hand of death
was on him.He bent upon Claverhouse eyes, in which the grey light of
insanity still twinkled, though just about to flit for ever, and
exclaimed, with his usual wildness of ejaculation, "Wilt thou trust in
thy bow and in thy spear, in thy steed and in thy banner?And shall not
God visit thee for innocent blood?--Wilt thou glory in thy wisdom, and in
thy courage, and in thy might?And shall not the Lord judge thee?--Behold
the princes, for whom thou hast sold thy soul to the destroyer, shall be
removed from their place, and banished to other lands, and their names
shall be a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse.And thou, who hast partaken of the wine-cup of fury, and hast been
drunken and mad because thereof, the wish of thy heart shall be granted
to thy loss, and the hope of thine own pride shall destroy thee.I summon
thee, John Grahame, to appear before the tribunal of God, to answer for
this innocent blood, and the seas besides which thou hast shed."He drew his right hand across his bleeding face, and held it up to heaven
as he uttered these words, which he spoke very loud, and then added more
faintly, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge
the blood of thy saints!"As he uttered the last word, he fell backwards without an attempt to save
himself, and was a dead man ere his head touched the floor.Morton was much shocked at this extraordinary scene, and the prophecy of
the dying man, which tallied so strangely with the wish which Claverhouse
had just expressed; and he often thought of it afterwards when that wish
seemed to be accomplished.Two of the dragoons who were in the apartment,
hardened as they were, and accustomed to such scenes, showed great
consternation at the sudden apparition, the event, and the words which
preceded it.At the first instant of
Mucklewrath's appearance, he had put his hand to his pistol, but on
seeing the situation of the wounded wretch, he immediately withdrew it,
and listened with great composure to his dying exclamation.When he dropped, Claverhouse asked, in an unconcerned tone of voice--"How
came the fellow here?--Speak, you staring fool!"he added, addressing the
nearest dragoon, "unless you would have me think you such a poltroon as
to fear a dying man."The dragoon crossed himself, and replied with a faltering voice,--"That
the dead fellow had escaped their notice when they removed the other
bodies, as he chanced to have fallen where a cloak or two had been flung
aside, and covered him.""Take him away now, then, you gaping idiot, and see that he does not bite
you, to put an old proverb to shame.--This is a new incident, Mr.Morton,
that dead men should rise and push us from our stools.I must see that my
blackguards grind their swords sharper; they used not to do their work so
slovenly.--But we have had a busy day; they are tired, and their blades
blunted with their bloody work; and I suppose you, Mr Morton, as well as
I, are well disposed for a few hours' repose."So saying, he yawned, and taking a candle which a soldier had placed
ready, saluted Morton courteously, and walked to the apartment which had
been prepared for him.Morton was also accommodated, for the evening, with a separate room.Being left alone, his first occupation was the returning thanks to Heaven
for redeeming him from danger, even through the instrumentality of those
who seemed his most dangerous enemies; he also prayed sincerely for the
Divine assistance in guiding his course through times which held out so
many dangers and so many errors.And having thus poured out his spirit in
prayer before the Great Being who gave it, he betook himself to the
repose which he so much required.The charge is prepared, the lawyers are met,
               The judges all ranged--a terrible show!So deep was the slumber which succeeded the agitation and embarrassment
of the preceding day, that Morton hardly knew where he was when it was
broken by the tramp of horses, the hoarse voice of men, and the wild
sound of the trumpets blowing the _reveille_.The sergeant-major
immediately afterwards came to summon him, which he did in a very
respectful manner, saying the General (for Claverhouse now held that
rank) hoped for the pleasure of his company upon the road.In some
situations an intimation is a command, and Morton considered that the
present occasion was one of these.He waited upon Claverhouse as speedily
as he could, found his own horse saddled for his use, and Cuddie in
attendance.Both were deprived of their fire-arms, though they seemed,
otherwise, rather to make part of the troop than of the prisoners; and
Morton was permitted to retain his sword, the wearing which was, in those
days, the distinguishing mark of a gentleman.Claverhouse seemed also to
take pleasure in riding beside him, in conversing with him, and in
confounding his ideas when he attempted to appreciate his real character.The gentleness and urbanity of that officer's general manners, the high
and chivalrous sentiments of military devotion which he occasionally
expressed, his deep and accurate insight into the human bosom, demanded
at once the approbation and the wonder of those who conversed with him;
while, on the other hand, his cold indifference to military violence and
cruelty seemed altogether inconsistent with the social, and even
admirable qualities which he displayed.Morton could not help, in his
heart, contrasting him with Balfour of Burley; and so deeply did the idea
impress him, that he dropped a hint of it as they rode together at some
distance from the troop."You are right," said Claverhouse, with a smile; "you are very right--we
are both fanatics; but there is some distinction between the fanaticism
of honour and that of dark and sullen superstition.""Yet you both shed blood without mercy or remorse," said Morton, who
could not suppress his feelings."Surely," said Claverhouse, with the same composure; "but of what
kind?--There is a difference, I trust, between the blood of learned and
reverend prelates and scholars, of gallant soldiers and noble gentlemen,
and the red puddle that stagnates in the veins of psalm-singing
mechanics, crackbrained demagogues, and sullen boors;--some distinction,
in short, between spilling a flask of generous wine, and dashing down a
can full of base muddy ale?""Your distinction is too nice for my comprehension," replied Morton."God
gives every spark of life--that of the peasant as well as of the prince;
and those who destroy his work recklessly or causelessly, must answer in
either case.What right, for example, have I to General Grahame's
protection now, more than when I first met him?""And narrowly escaped the consequences, you would say?"answered
Claverhouse--"why, I will answer you frankly.Then I thought I had to do
with the son of an old roundheaded rebel, and the nephew of a sordid
presbyterian laird; now I know your points better, and there is that
about you which I respect in an enemy as much as I like in a friend.I
have learned a good deal concerning you since our first meeting, and I
trust that you have found that my construction of the information has not
been unfavourable to you.""But yet," said Morton--

"But yet," interrupted Grahame, taking up the word, "you would say you
were the same when I first met you that you are now?True; but then, how
could I know that?though, by the by, even my reluctance to suspend your
execution may show you how high your abilities stood in my estimation.""Do you expect, General," said Morton, "that I ought to be particularly
grateful for such a mark of your esteem?""I tell you I thought
you a different sort of person."I have half a mind," said Claverhouse, "to contrive you should have six
months' imprisonment in order to procure you that pleasure.His chapters
inspire me with more enthusiasm than even poetry itself.And the noble
canon, with what true chivalrous feeling he confines his beautiful
expressions of sorrow to the death of the gallant and high-bred knight,
of whom it was a pity to see the fall, such was his loyalty to his king,
pure faith to his religion, hardihood towards his enemy, and fidelity to
his lady-love!--Ah, benedicite!how he will mourn over the fall of such a
pearl of knighthood, be it on the side he happens to favour, or on the
other.But, truly, for sweeping from the face of the earth some few
hundreds of villain churls, who are born but to plough it, the high-born
and inquisitive historian has marvellous little sympathy,--as little, or
less, perhaps, than John Grahame of Claverhouse.""There is one ploughman in your possession, General, for whom," said
Morton, "in despite of the contempt in which you hold a profession which
some philosophers have considered as useful as that of a soldier, I would
humbly request your favour.""You mean," said Claverhouse, looking at a memorandum book, "one
Hatherick--Hedderick--or--or--Headrigg.Ay, Cuthbert, or Cuddie
Headrigg--here I have him.O, never fear him, if he will be but
tractable.The ladies of Tillietudlem made interest with me on his
account some time ago.He is to marry their waiting-maid, I think.He
will be allowed to slip off easy, unless his obstinacy spoils his good
fortune.""He has no ambition to be a martyr, I believe," said Morton."'Tis the better for him," said Claverhouse."But, besides, although the
fellow had more to answer for, I should stand his friend, for the sake of
the blundering gallantry which threw him into the midst of our ranks last
night, when seeking assistance for you.I never desert any man who trusts
me with such implicit confidence.But, to deal sincerely with you, he has
been long in our eye.--Here, Halliday; bring me up the black book."The sergeant, having committed to his commander this ominous record of
the disaffected, which was arranged in alphabetical order, Claverhouse,
turning over the leaves as he rode on, began to read names as they
occurred."Gumblegumption, a minister, aged 50, indulged, close, sly, and so
forth--Pooh!pooh!--He--He--I have him here--Heathercat; outlawed--a
preacher--a zealous Cameronian--keeps a conventicle among the Campsie
hills--Tush!--O, here is Headrigg--Cuthbert; his mother a bitter
puritan--himself a simple fellow--like to be forward in action, but of
no genius for plots--more for the hand than the head, and might be drawn
to the right side, but for his attachment to"--(Here Claverhouse looked
at Morton, and then shut the book and changed his tone.)"Faithful and
true are words never thrown away upon me, Mr Morton.You may depend on
the young man's safety.""Does it not revolt a mind like yours," said Morton, "to follow a system
which is to be supported by such minute enquiries after obscure
individuals?""You do not suppose we take the trouble?""The curates, for their own sakes, willingly collect all these materials
for their own regulation in each parish; they know best the black sheep
of the flock."Will you favour me by imparting it?""Willingly," said Claverhouse; "it can signify little, for you cannot
avenge yourself on the curate, as you will probably leave Scotland for
some time."Morton felt an involuntary
shudder at hearing words which implied a banishment from his native land;
but ere he answered, Claverhouse proceeded to read, "Henry Morton, son of
Silas Morton, Colonel of horse for the Scottish Parliament, nephew and
apparent heir of Morton of Milnwood--imperfectly educated, but with
spirit beyond his years--excellent at all exercises--indifferent to forms
of religion, but seems to incline to the presbyterian--has high-flown and
dangerous notions about liberty of thought and speech, and hovers between
a latitudinarian and an enthusiast.Much admired and followed by the
youth of his own age--modest, quiet, and unassuming in manner, but in his
heart peculiarly bold and intractable.He is--Here follow three red
crosses, Mr Morton, which signify triply dangerous.You see how important
a person you are.--But what does this fellow want?"A horseman rode up as he spoke, and gave a letter.Claverhouse glanced it
over, laughed scornfully, bade him tell his master to send his prisoners
to Edinburgh, for there was no answer; and, as the man turned back, said
contemptuously to Morton--"Here is an ally of yours deserted from you, or
rather, I should say, an ally of your good friend Burley--Hear how he
sets forth--'Dear Sir,' (I wonder when we were such intimates,)'may it
please your Excellency to accept my humble congratulations on the
victory'--hum--hum--'blessed his Majesty's army.I pray you to understand
I have my people under arms to take and intercept all fugitives, and have
already several prisoners,' and so forth.Subscribed Basil Olifant--You
know the fellow by name, I suppose?""A relative of Lady Margaret Bellenden," replied Morton, "is he not?""Ay," replied Grahame, "and heir-male of her father's family, though a
distant one, and moreover a suitor to the fair Edith, though discarded as
an unworthy one; but, above all, a devoted admirer of the estate of
Tillietudlem, and all thereunto belonging.""He takes an ill mode of recommending himself," said Morton, suppressing
his feelings, "to the family at Tillietudlem, by corresponding with our
unhappy party.""O, this precious Basil will turn cat in pan with any man!""He was displeased with the government, because they would
not overturn in his favour a settlement of the late Earl of Torwood, by
which his lordship gave his own estate to his own daughter; he was
displeased with Lady Margaret, because she avowed no desire for his
alliance, and with the pretty Edith, because she did not like his tall
ungainly person.So he held a close correspondence with Burley, and
raised his followers with the purpose of helping him, providing always he
needed no help, that is, if you had beat us yesterday.And now the rascal
pretends he was all the while proposing the King's service, and, for
aught I know, the council will receive his pretext for current coin, for
he knows how to make friends among them--and a dozen scores of poor
vagabond fanatics will be shot, or hanged, while this cunning scoundrel
lies hid under the double cloak of loyalty, well-lined with the fox-fur
of hypocrisy."With conversation on this and other matters they beguiled the way,
Claverhouse all the while speaking with great frankness to Morton, and
treating him rather as a friend and companion than as a prisoner; so
that, however uncertain of his fate, the hours he passed in the company
of this remarkable man were so much lightened by the varied play of his
imagination, and the depth of his knowledge of human nature, that since
the period of his becoming a prisoner of war, which relieved him at once
from the cares of his doubtful and dangerous station among the
insurgents, and from the consequences of their suspicious resentment, his
hours flowed on less anxiously than at any time since his having
commenced actor in public life.He was now, with respect to his fortune,
like a rider who has flung his reins on the horse's neck, and, while he
abandoned himself to circumstances, was at least relieved from the task
of attempting to direct them.In this mood he journeyed on, the number of
his companions being continually augmented by detached parties of horse
who came in from every quarter of the country, bringing with them, for
the most part, the unfortunate persons who had fallen into their power."Our council," said Claverhouse, "being resolved, I suppose, to testify
by their present exultation the extent of their former terror, have
decreed a kind of triumphal entry to us victors and our captives; but as
I do not quite approve the taste of it, I am willing to avoid my own part
in the show, and, at the same time, to save you from yours."So saying, he gave up the command of the forces to Allan, (now a
Lieutenant-colonel,) and, turning his horse into a by-lane, rode into the
city privately, accompanied by Morton and two or three servants.When
Claverhouse arrived at the quarters which he usually occupied in the
Canongate, he assigned to his prisoner a small apartment, with an
intimation, that his parole confined him to it for the present.After about a quarter of an hour spent in solitary musing on the strange
vicissitudes of his late life, the attention of Morton was summoned to
the window by a great noise in the street beneath.Trumpets, drums, and
kettle-drums, contended in noise with the shouts of a numerous rabble,
and apprised him that the royal cavalry were passing in the triumphal
attitude which Claverhouse had mentioned.The magistrates of the city,
attended by their guard of halberds, had met the victors with their
welcome at the gate of the city, and now preceded them as a part of the
procession.The next object was two heads borne upon pikes; and before
each bloody head were carried the hands of the dismembered sufferers,
which were, by the brutal mockery of those who bore them, often
approached towards each other as if in the attitude of exhortation or
prayer.These bloody trophies belonged to two preachers who had fallen at
Bothwell Bridge.After them came a cart led by the executioner's
assistant, in which were placed Macbriar, and other two prisoners, who
seemed of the same profession.They were bareheaded, and strongly bound,
yet looked around them with an air rather of triumph than dismay, and
appeared in no respect moved either by the fate of their companions, of
which the bloody evidences were carried before them, or by dread of their
own approaching execution, which these preliminaries so plainly
indicated.Behind these prisoners, thus held up to public infamy and derision, came
a body of horse, brandishing their broadswords, and filling the wide
street with acclamations, which were answered by the tumultuous outcries
and shouts of the rabble, who, in every considerable town, are too happy
in being permitted to huzza for any thing whatever which calls them
together.In the rear of these troopers came the main body of the
prisoners, at the head of whom were some of their leaders, who were
treated with every circumstance of inventive mockery and insult.Several
were placed on horseback with their faces to the animal's tail; others
were chained to long bars of iron, which they were obliged to support in
their hands, like the galleyslaves in Spain when travelling to the port
where they are to be put on shipboard.The heads of others who had fallen
were borne in triumph before the survivors, some on pikes and halberds,
some in sacks, bearing the names of the slaughtered persons labelled on
the outside.Such were the objects who headed the ghastly procession, who
seemed as effectually doomed to death as if they wore the sanbenitos of
the condemned heretics in an auto-da-fe.[Note: David Hackston of
Rathillet, who was wounded and made prisoner in the skirmish of
Air's-Moss, in which the celebrated Cameron fell, was, on entering
Edinburgh, "by order of the Council, received by the Magistrates at the
Watergate, and set on a horse's bare back with his face to the tail, and
the other three laid on a goad of iron, and carried up the street, Mr
Cameron's head being on a halberd before them."]Behind them came on the nameless crowd to the number of several hundreds,
some retaining under their misfortunes a sense of confidence in the cause
for which they suffered captivity, and were about to give a still more
bloody testimony; others seemed pale, dispirited, dejected, questioning
in their own minds their prudence in espousing a cause which Providence
seemed to have disowned, and looking about for some avenue through which
they might escape from the consequences of their rashness.Others there
were who seemed incapable of forming an opinion on the subject, or of
entertaining either hope, confidence, or fear, but who, foaming with
thirst and fatigue, stumbled along like over-driven oxen, lost to every
thing but their present sense of wretchedness, and without having any
distinct idea whether they were led to the shambles or to the pasture.These unfortunate men were guarded on each hand by troopers, and behind
them came the main body of the cavalry, whose military music resounded
back from the high houses on each side of the street, and mingled with
their own songs of jubilee and triumph, and the wild shouts of the
rabble.Morton felt himself heart-sick while he gazed on the dismal spectacle,
and recognised in the bloody heads, and still more miserable and agonized
features of the living sufferers, faces which had been familiar to him
during the brief insurrection.He sunk down in a chair in a bewildered
and stupified state, from which he was awakened by the voice of Cuddie.said the poor fellow, his teeth chattering like a
pair of nut-crackers, his hair erect like boar's bristles, and his face
as pale as that of a corpse--"Lord forgie us, sir!we maun instantly gang
before the Council!--O Lord, what made them send for a puir bodie like
me, sae mony braw lords and gentles!--and there's my mither come on the
lang tramp frae Glasgow to see to gar me testify, as she ca's it, that is
to say, confess and be hanged; but deil tak me if they mak sic a guse o'
Cuddie, if I can do better.But here's Claverhouse himsell--the Lord
preserve and forgie us, I say anes mair!""You must immediately attend the Council Mr Morton," said Claverhouse,
who entered while Cuddie spoke, "and your servant must go with you.You
need be under no apprehension for the consequences to yourself
personally.But I warn you that you will see something that will give you
much pain, and from which I would willingly have saved you, if I had
possessed the power.It will be readily supposed that Morton did not venture to dispute this
invitation, however unpleasant."I must apprise you," said the latter, as he led the way down stairs,
"that you will get off cheap; and so will your servant, provided he can
keep his tongue quiet."Cuddie caught these last words to his exceeding joy."Deil a fear o' me," said he, "an my mither disna pit her finger in the
pie."At that moment his shoulder was seized by old Mause, who had contrived to
thrust herself forward into the lobby of the apartment."O, hinny, hinny!"said she to Cuddie, hanging upon his neck, "glad and
proud, and sorry and humbled am I, a'in ane and the same instant, to see
my bairn ganging to testify for the truth gloriously with his mouth in
council, as he did with his weapon in the field!""Whisht, whisht, mither!""Odd, ye daft wife,
is this a time to speak o' thae things?I tell ye I'll testify naething
either ae gate or another.I hae spoken to Mr Poundtext, and I'll tak the
declaration, or whate'er they ca'it, and we're a' to win free off if we
do that--he's gotten life for himsell and a' his folk, and that's a
minister for my siller; I like nane o' your sermons that end in a psalm
at the Grassmarket."[Note: Then the place of public execution.]"O, Cuddie, man, laith wad I be they suld hurt ye," said old Mause,
divided grievously between the safety of her son's soul and that of his
body; "but mind, my bonny bairn, ye hae battled for the faith, and dinna
let the dread o' losing creature-comforts withdraw ye frae the gude
fight.""Hout tout, mither," replied Cuddie, "I hae fought e'en ower muckle
already, and, to speak plain, I'm wearied o'the trade.I hae swaggered
wi' a' thae arms, and muskets, and pistols, buffcoats, and bandoliers,
lang eneugh, and I like the pleughpaidle a hantle better.I ken naething
suld gar a man fight, (that's to say, when he's no angry,) by and
out-taken the dread o'being hanged or killed if he turns back.""But, my dear Cuddie," continued the persevering Mause, "your bridal
garment--Oh, hinny, dinna sully the marriage garment!""Awa, awa, mither," replied.Cuddie; "dinna ye see the folks waiting for
me?--Never fear me--I ken how to turn this far better than ye do--for
ye're bleezing awa about marriage, and the job is how we are to win by
hanging."So saying, he extricated himself out of his mother's embraces, and
requested the soldiers who took him in charge to conduct him to the place
of examination without delay.He had been already preceded by Claverhouse
and Morton.The Privy Council of Scotland, in whom the practice since the union of
the crowns vested great judicial powers, as well as the general
superintendence of the executive department, was met in the ancient dark
Gothic room, adjoining to the House of Parliament in Edinburgh, when
General Grahame entered and took his place amongst the members at the
council table."You have brought us a leash of game to-day, General," said a nobleman of
high place amongst them."Here is a craven to confess--a cock of the game
to stand at bay--and what shall I call the third, General?""Without further metaphor, I will entreat your Grace to call him a person
in whom I am specially interested," replied Claverhouse.said the nobleman, lolling out a tongue
which was at all times too big for his mouth, and accommodating his
coarse features to a sneer, to which they seemed to be familiar."Yes, please your Grace, a whig; as your Grace was in 1641," replied
Claverhouse, with his usual appearance of imperturbable civility."He has you there, I think, my Lord Duke," said one of the Privy
Councillors."Ay, ay," returned the Duke, laughing, "there's no speaking to him since
Drumclog--but come, bring in the prisoners--and do you, Mr Clerk, read
the record."The clerk read forth a bond, in which General Grahame of Claverhouse and
Lord Evandale entered themselves securities, that Henry Morton, younger
of Milnwood, should go abroad and remain in foreign parts, until his
Majesty's pleasure was further known, in respect of the said Henry
Morton's accession to the late rebellion, and that under penalty of life
and limb to the said Henry Morton, and of ten thousand marks to each of
his securities."Do you accept of the King's mercy upon these terms, Mr Morton?"said the
Duke of Lauderdale, who presided in the Council."I have no other choice, my lord," replied Morton.Morton did so without reply, conscious that, in the circumstances of his
case, it was impossible for him to have escaped more easily.Macbriar,
who was at the same instant brought to the foot of the council-table,
bound upon a chair, for his weakness prevented him from standing, beheld
Morton in the act of what he accounted apostasy."He hath summed his defection by owning the carnal power of the tyrant!"he exclaimed, with a deep groan--"A fallen star!--a fallen star!""Hold your peace, sir," said the Duke, "and keep your ain breath to cool
your ain porridge--ye'll find them scalding hot, I promise you.--Call in
the other fellow, who has some common sense.One sheep will leap the
ditch when another goes first."Cuddie was introduced unbound, but under the guard of two halberdiers,
and placed beside Macbriar at the foot of the table.The poor fellow cast
a piteous look around him, in which were mingled awe for the great men in
whose presence he stood, and compassion for his fellow-sufferers, with no
small fear of the personal consequences which impended over himself.He
made his clownish obeisances with a double portion of reverence, and then
awaited the opening of the awful scene."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Brigg?"was the first question which
was thundered in his ears.Cuddie meditated a denial, but had sense enough, upon reflection, to
discover that the truth would be too strong for him; so he replied, with
true Caledonian indirectness of response, "I'll no say but it may be
possible that I might hae been there.""Answer directly, you knave--yes, or no?--You know you were there.""It's no for me to contradict your Lordship's Grace's honour," said
Cuddie."Once more, sir, were you there?--yes, or no?""Dear stir," again replied Cuddie, "how can ane mind preceesely where
they hae been a' the days o' their life?""Speak out, you scoundrel," said General Dalzell, "or I'll dash your
teeth out with my dudgeonhaft!--Do you think we can stand here all day to
be turning and dodging with you, like greyhounds after a hare?"[Note:
The General is said to have struck one of the captive whigs, when under
examination, with the hilt of his sabre, so that the blood gushed out.The provocation for this unmanly violence was, that the prisoner had
called the fierce veteran "a Muscovy beast, who used to roast men."Dalzell had been long in the Russian service, which in those days was no
school of humanity.]"Aweel, then," said Cuddie, "since naething else will please ye, write
down that I cannot deny but I was there.""Well, sir," said the Duke, "and do you think that the rising upon that
occasion was rebellion or not?""I'm no just free to gie my opinion, stir," said the cautious captive,
"on what might cost my neck; but I doubt it will be very little better.""Just than rebellion, as your honour ca's it," replied Cuddie."Well, sir, that's speaking to the purpose," replied his Grace."And are
you content to accept of the King's pardon for your guilt as a rebel, and
to keep the church, and pray for the King?""Blithely, stir," answered the unscrupulous Cuddie; "and drink his health
into the bargain, when the ale's gude.""Egad," said the Duke, "this is a hearty cock.--What brought you into
such a scrape, mine honest friend?""Just ill example, stir," replied the prisoner, "and a daft auld jaud of
a mither, wi' reverence to your Grace's honour.""Why, God-a-mercy, my friend," replied the Duke, "take care of bad advice
another time; I think you are not likely to commit treason on your own
score.--Make out his free pardon, and bring forward the rogue in the
chair."Macbriar was then moved forward to the post of examination."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Bridge?"was, in like manner,
demanded of him."I was," answered the prisoner, in a bold and resolute tone."I was not--I went in my calling as a preacher of God's word, to
encourage them that drew the sword in His cause.""In other words, to aid and abet the rebels?""Thou hast spoken it," replied the prisoner."Well, then," continued the interrogator, "let us know if you saw John
Balfour of Burley among the party?--I presume you know him?""I bless God that I do know him," replied Macbriar; "he is a zealous and
a sincere Christian.""And when and where did you last see this pious personage?""I am here to answer for myself," said Macbriar, in the same dauntless
manner, "and not to endanger others.""We shall know," said Dalzell, "how to make you find your tongue.""If you can make him fancy himself in a conventicle," answered
Lauderdale, "he will find it without you.--Come, laddie, speak while the
play is good--you're too young to bear the burden will be laid on you
else.""I defy you," retorted Macbriar."This has not been the first of my
imprisonments or of my sufferings; and, young as I may be, I have lived
long enough to know how to die when I am called upon.""Ay, but there are some things which must go before an easy death, if you
continue obstinate," said Lauderdale, and rung a small silver bell which
was placed before him on the table.A dark crimson curtain, which covered a sort of niche, or Gothic recess
in the wall, rose at the signal, and displayed the public executioner, a
tall, grim, and hideous man, having an oaken table before him, on which
lay thumb-screws, and an iron case, called the Scottish boot, used in
those tyrannical days to torture accused persons.Morton, who was
unprepared for this ghastly apparition, started when the curtain arose,
but Macbriar's nerves were more firm.He gazed upon the horrible
apparatus with much composure; and if a touch of nature called the blood
from his cheek for a second, resolution sent it back to his brow with
greater energy.said Lauderdale, in a low, stern voice,
almost sinking into a whisper."He is, I suppose," replied Macbriar, "the infamous executioner of your
bloodthirsty commands upon the persons of God's people.He and you are
equally beneath my regard; and, I bless God, I no more fear what he can
inflict than what you can command.Flesh and blood may shrink under the
sufferings you can doom me to, and poor frail nature may shed tears, or
send forth cries; but I trust my soul is anchored firmly on the rock of
ages.""Do your duty," said the Duke to the executioner.The fellow advanced, and asked, with a harsh and discordant voice, upon
which of the prisoner's limbs he should first employ his engine."Let him choose for himself," said the Duke; "I should like to oblige him
in any thing that is reasonable.""Since you leave it to me," said the prisoner, stretching forth his right
leg, "take the best--I willingly bestow it in the cause for which I
suffer."[Note: This was the reply actually made by James Mitchell when
subjected to the torture of the boot, for an attempt to assassinate
Archbishop Sharpe.]The executioner, with the help of his assistants, enclosed the leg and
knee within the tight iron boot, or case, and then placing a wedge of the
same metal between the knee and the edge of the machine, took a mallet in
his hand, and stood waiting for farther orders.A well-dressed man, by
profession a surgeon, placed himself by the other side of the prisoner's
chair, bared the prisoner's arm, and applied his thumb to the pulse in
order to regulate the torture according to the strength of the patient.When these preparations were made, the President of the Council repeated
with the same stern voice the question, "When and where did you last see
John Balfour of Burley?"The prisoner, instead of replying to him, turned his eyes to heaven as if
imploring Divine strength, and muttered a few words, of which the last
were distinctly audible, "Thou hast said thy people shall be willing in
the day of thy power!"The Duke of Lauderdale glanced his eye around the council as if to
collect their suffrages, and, judging from their mute signs, gave on his
own part a nod to the executioner, whose mallet instantly descended on
the wedge, and, forcing it between the knee and the iron boot, occasioned
the most exquisite pain, as was evident from the flush which instantly
took place on the brow and on the cheeks of the sufferer.The fellow then
again raised his weapon, and stood prepared to give a second blow."Will you yet say," repeated the Duke of Lauderdale, "where and when you
last parted from Balfour of Burley?""You have my answer," said the sufferer resolutely, and the second blow
fell.The third and fourth succeeded; but at the fifth, when a larger
wedge had been introduced, the prisoner set up a scream of agony.Morton, whose blood boiled within him at witnessing such cruelty, could
bear no longer, and, although unarmed and himself in great danger, was
springing forward, when Claverhouse, who observed his emotion, withheld
him by force, laying one hand on his arm and the other on his mouth,
while he whispered, "For God's sake, think where you are!"This movement, fortunately for him, was observed by no other of the
councillors, whose attention was engaged with the dreadful scene before
them."He is gone," said the surgeon--"he has fainted, my Lords, and human
nature can endure no more.""Release him," said the Duke; and added, turning to Dalzell, "He will
make an old proverb good, for he'll scarce ride to-day, though he has had
his boots on."Ay, dispatch his sentence, and have done with him; we have plenty of
drudgery behind."Strong waters and essences were busily employed to recall the senses of
the unfortunate captive; and, when his first faint gasps intimated a
return of sensation, the Duke pronounced sentence of death upon him, as a
traitor taken in the act of open rebellion, and adjudged him to be
carried from the bar to the common place of execution, and there hanged
by the neck; his head and hands to be stricken off after death, and
disposed of according to the pleasure of the Council, [Note: The pleasure
of the Council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage
as the rest of their conduct.The heads of the preachers were frequently
exposed on pikes between their two hands, the palms displayed as in the
attitude of prayer.When the celebrated Richard Cameron's head was
exposed in this manner, a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one
who lived praying and preaching, and died praying and fighting.]and all
and sundry his movable goods and gear escheat and inbrought to his
Majesty's use."Doomster," he continued, "repeat the sentence to the prisoner."The office of Doomster was in those days, and till a much later period,
held by the executioner in commendam, with his ordinary functions.[Note:
See a note on the subject of this office in the Heart of Mid-Lothian.]The duty consisted in reciting to the unhappy criminal the sentence of
the law as pronounced by the judge, which acquired an additional and
horrid emphasis from the recollection, that the hateful personage by whom
it was uttered was to be the agent of the cruelties he denounced.Macbriar had scarce understood the purport of the words as first
pronounced by the Lord President of the Council; but he was sufficiently
recovered to listen and to reply to the sentence when uttered by the
harsh and odious voice of the ruffian who was to execute it, and at the
last awful words, "And this I pronounce for doom," he answered boldly--
"My Lords, I thank you for the only favour I looked for, or would accept
at your hands, namely, that you have sent the crushed and maimed carcass,
which has this day sustained your cruelty, to this hasty end.It were
indeed little to me whether I perish on the gallows or in the
prison-house; but if death, following close on what I have this day
suffered, had found me in my cell of darkness and bondage, many might
have lost the sight how a Christian man can suffer in the good cause.For
the rest, I forgive you, my Lords, for what you have appointed and I have
sustained--And why should I not?--Ye send me to a happy exchange--to the
company of angels and the spirits of the just, for that of frail dust
and ashes--Ye send me from darkness into day--from mortality to
immortality--and, in a word, from earth to heaven!--If the thanks,
therefore, and pardon of a dying man can do you good, take them at my
hand, and may your last moments be as happy as mine!"As he spoke thus, with a countenance radiant with joy and triumph, he was
withdrawn by those who had brought him into the apartment, and executed
within half an hour, dying with the same enthusiastic firmness which his
whole life had evinced.The Council broke up, and Morton found himself again in the carriage with
General Grahame."Marvellous firmness and gallantry!"said Morton, as he reflected upon
Macbriar's conduct; "what a pity it is that with such self-devotion and
heroism should have been mingled the fiercer features of his sect!""You mean," said Claverhouse, "his resolution to condemn you to death?--
To that he would have reconciled himself by a single text; for example,
'And Phinehas arose and executed judgment,' or something to the same
purpose.--But wot ye where you are now bound, Mr Morton?""We are on the road to Leith, I observe," answered Morton."Can I not be
permitted to see my friends ere I leave my native land?""Your uncle," replied Grahame, "has been spoken to, and declines visiting
you.The good gentleman is terrified, and not without some reason, that
the crime of your treason may extend itself over his lands and
tenements--he sends you, however, his blessing, and a small sum of money.Major Bellenden is at
Tillietudlem putting matters in order.The scoundrels have made great
havoc there with Lady Margaret's muniments of antiquity, and have
desecrated and destroyed what the good lady called the Throne of his most
Sacred Majesty.Is there any one else whom you would wish to see?"Morton sighed deeply as he answered, "No--it would avail nothing.--But my
preparations,--small as they are, some must be necessary.""They are all ready for you," said the General."Lord Evandale has
anticipated all you wish.Here is a packet from him with letters of
recommendation for the court of the Stadtholder Prince of Orange, to
which I have added one or two.I made my first campaigns under him, and
first saw fire at the battle of Seneff.Claverhouse
greatly distinguished himself in this action, and was made Captain.]There are also bills of exchange for your immediate wants, and more will
be sent when you require it."Morton heard all this and received the parcel with an astounded and
confused look, so sudden was the execution of the sentence of banishment."He shall be taken care of, and replaced, if it be practicable, in the
service of Lady Margaret Bellenden; I think he will hardly neglect the
parade of the feudal retainers, or go a-whigging a second time.--But here
we are upon the quay, and the boat waits you."A boat waited for Captain Morton, with
the trunks and baggage belonging to his rank.Claverhouse shook him by
the hand, and wished him good fortune, and a happy return to Scotland in
quieter times."I shall never forget," he said, "the gallantry of your behaviour to my
friend Evandale, in circumstances when many men would have sought to rid
him out of their way."As Morton descended the pier
to get into the boat, a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very
small space.The person who gave it seemed much muffled
up; he pressed his finger upon his lip, and then disappeared among the
crowd.The incident awakened Morton's curiosity; and when he found
himself on board of a vessel bound for Rotterdam, and saw all his
companions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements, he took an
opportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him.It ran
thus:--"Thy courage on the fatal day when Israel fled before his
enemies, hath, in some measure, atoned for thy unhappy owning of the
Erastian interest.These are not days for Ephraim to strive with Israel.--I know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger.But turn from
that folly; for in exile, and in flight, and even in death itself, shall
my hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house, and Providence
hath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of
ruin and confiscation.The resistance of their stronghold was the main
cause of our being scattered at Bothwell Bridge, and I have bound it upon
my soul to visit it upon them.Wherefore, think of her no more, but join
with our brethren in banishment, whose hearts are still towards this
miserable land to save and to relieve her.There is an honest remnant in
Holland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance.Join thyself unto
them like the true son of the stout and worthy Silas Morton, and thou
wilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own
working.Shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard,
thou wilt at all times hear of my in-comings and out-goings, by enquiring
after Quintin Mackell of Irongray, at the house of that singular
Christian woman, Bessie Maclure, near to the place called the Howff,
where Niel Blane entertaineth guests.So much from him who hopes to hear
again from thee in brotherhood, resisting unto blood, and striving
against sin.Keep thy sword
girded, and thy lamp burning, as one that wakes in the night; for He who
shall judge the Mount of Esau, and shall make false professors as straw,
and malignants as stubble, will come in the fourth watch with garments
dyed in blood, and the house of Jacob shall be for spoil, and the house
of Joseph for fire.I am he that hath written it, whose hand hath been on
the mighty in the waste field."This extraordinary letter was subscribed J. B. of B.; but the signature
of these initials was not necessary for pointing out to Morton that it
could come from no other than Burley.It gave him new occasion to admire
the indomitable spirit of this man, who, with art equal to his courage
and obstinacy, was even now endeavouring to re-establish the web of
conspiracy which had been so lately torn to pieces.But he felt no sort
of desire, in the present moment, to sustain a correspondence which must
be perilous, or to renew an association, which, in so many ways, had been
nearly fatal to him.The threats which Burley held out against the family
of Bellenden, he considered as a mere expression of his spleen on account
of their defence of Tillietudlem; and nothing seemed less likely than
that, at the very moment of their party being victorious, their fugitive
and distressed adversary could exercise the least influence over their
fortunes.Morton, however, hesitated for an instant, whether he should not send
the Major or Lord Evandale intimation of Burley's threats.Upon
consideration, he thought he could not do so without betraying his
confidential correspondence; for to warn them of his menaces would have
served little purpose, unless he had given them a clew to prevent them,
by apprehending his person; while, by doing so, he deemed he should
commit an ungenerous breach of trust to remedy an evil which seemed
almost imaginary.Upon mature consideration, therefore, he tore the
letter, having first made a memorandum of the name and place where the
writer was to be heard of, and threw the fragments into the sea.While Morton was thus employed the vessel was unmoored, and the white
sails swelled out before a favourable north-west wind.The ship leaned
her side to the gale, and went roaring through the waves, leaving a long
and rippling furrow to track her course.The city and port from which he
had sailed became undistinguishable in the distance; the hills by which
they were surrounded melted finally into the blue sky, and Morton was
separated for several years from the land of his nativity.It is fortunate for tale-tellers that they are not tied down like
theatrical writers to the unities of time and place, but may conduct
their personages to Athens and Thebes at their pleasure, and bring them
back at their convenience.Time, to use Rosalind's simile, has hitherto
paced with the hero of our tale; for betwixt Morton's first appearance as
a competitor for the popinjay and his final departure for Holland hardly
two months elapsed.Years, however, glided away ere we find it possible
to resume the thread of our narrative, and Time must be held to have
galloped over the interval.Craving, therefore, the privilege of my cast,
I entreat the reader's attention to the continuation of the narrative, as
it starts from a new era, being the year immediately subsequent to the
British Revolution.Scotland had just begun to repose from the convulsion occasioned by a
change of dynasty, and, through the prudent tolerance of King William,
had narrowly escaped the horrors of a protracted civil war.Agriculture
began to revive, and men, whose minds had been disturbed by the violent
political concussions, and the general change of government in Church and
State, had begun to recover their ordinary temper, and to give the usual
attention to their own private affairs, in lieu of discussing those of
the public.The Highlanders alone resisted the newly established order of
things, and were in arms in a considerable body under the Viscount of
Dundee, whom our readers have hitherto known by the name of Grahame of
Claverhouse.But the usual state of the Highlands was so unruly that
their being more or less disturbed was not supposed greatly to affect the
general tranquillity of the country, so long as their disorders were
confined within their own frontiers.In the Lowlands, the Jacobites, now
the undermost party, had ceased to expect any immediate advantage by open
resistance, and were, in their turn, driven to hold private meetings, and
form associations for mutual defence, which the government termed
treason, while they cried out persecution.The triumphant Whigs, while they re-established Presbytery as the
national religion, and assigned to the General Assemblies of the Kirk
their natural influence, were very far from going the lengths which the
Cameronians and more extravagant portion of the nonconformists under
Charles and James loudly demanded.They would listen to no proposal for
re-establishing the Solemn League and Covenant; and those who had
expected to find in King William a zealous Covenanted Monarch, were
grievously disappointed when he intimated, with the phlegm peculiar to
his country, his intention to tolerate all forms of religion which were
consistent with the safety of the State.The principles of indulgence
thus espoused and gloried in by the Government gave great offence to the
more violent party, who condemned them as diametrically contrary to
Scripture,--for which narrow-spirited doctrine they cited various texts,
all, as it may well be supposed, detached from their context, and most of
them derived from the charges given to the Jews in the Old Testament
dispensation to extirpate idolaters out of the Promised Land.They also
murmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in
exercising the rights of patronage, which they termed a rape upon the
chastity of the Church.They censured and condemned as Erastian many of
the measures by which Government after the Revolution showed an
inclination to interfere with the management of the Church, and they
positively refused to take the oath of allegiance to King William and
Queen Mary until they should, on their part, have sworn to the Solemn
League--and Covenant, the Magna Charta, as they termed it, of the
Presbyterian Church.This party, therefore, remained grumbling and dissatisfied, and made
repeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath, which, had
they been prosecuted as in the two former reigns, would have led to the
same consequence of open rebellion.But as the murmurers were allowed to
hold their meetings uninterrupted, and to testify as much as they pleased
against Socinianism, Erastianism, and all the compliances and defections
of the time, their zeal, unfanned by persecution, died gradually away,
their numbers became diminished, and they sunk into the scattered remnant
of serious, scrupulous, and harmless enthusiasts, of whom Old Mortality,
whose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale, may be taken as no
bad representative.But in the years which immediately succeeded the
Revolution, the Cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and
vehement in their political opinions, whom Government wished to
discourage, while they prudently temporised with them.These men formed
one violent party in the State; and the Episcopalian and Jacobite
interest, notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity, yet
repeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them, and avail themselves of
their discontents, to obtain their assistance in recalling the Stewart
family.The Revolutionary Government in the mean while, was supported by
the great bulk of the Lowland interest, who were chiefly disposed to a
moderate Presbytery, and formed in a great measure the party who in the
former oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the Cameronians for having
exercised that form of worship under the declaration of Indulgence issued
by Charles II.Such was the state of parties in Scotland immediately
subsequent to the Revolution.It was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger, well mounted, and
having the appearance of a military man of rank, rode down a winding
descent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle
and the river Clyde, which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods
to sweep around the towers formerly built by Aymer de Valence.Bothwell
Bridge was at a little distance, and also in sight.The opposite field,
once the scene of slaughter and conflict, now lay as placid and quiet as
the surface of a summer lake.The trees and bushes, which grew around in
romantic variety of shade, were hardly seen to stir under the influence
of the evening breeze.The very murmur of the river seemed to soften
itself into unison with the stillness of the scene around.The path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by
detached trees of great size, and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of
flourishing orchards, now laden with summer fruits.The nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the
abode of a small proprietor, situated on the side of a sunny bank which
was covered by apple and pear trees.At the foot of the path which led up
to this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation
of a porter's lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose.The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in
Scotland.It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes
were mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock
hard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him
before the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated
that the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended
from the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green
trees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready.To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about
five years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain
of the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old
oak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.The stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph, desiring
to know the way to Fairy Knowe.The child set down her water-pitcher,
hardly understanding what was said to her, put her fair flaxen hair apart
on her brows, and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering "What's
your wull?"which is usually a peasant's first answer, if it can be
called one, to all questions whatever."I wish to know the way to Fairy Knowe.""Mammie, mammie," exclaimed the little rustic, running towards the door
of the hut, "come out and speak to the gentleman."Her mother appeared,--a handsome young country-woman, to whose features,
originally sly and espiegle in expression, matrimony had given that
decent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasant's wife of
Scotland.She had an infant in one arm, and with the other she smoothed
down her apron, to which hung a chubby child of two years old.The elder
girl, whom the traveller had first seen, fell back behind her mother as
soon as she appeared, and kept that station, occasionally peeping out to
look at the stranger.said the woman, with an air of respectful
breeding not quite common in her rank of life, but without anything
resembling forwardness.The stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment, and then
replied, "I am seeking a place called Fairy Knowe, and a man called
Cuthbert Headrigg."It's my gudeman, sir," said the young woman, with a smile of welcome."Will you alight, sir, and come into our puir dwelling?--Cuddie,
Cuddie,"--a white-headed rogue of four years appeared at the door of the
hut--"rin awa, my bonny man, and tell your father a gentleman wants him.Or, stay,--Jenny, ye'll hae mair sense: rin ye awa and tell him; he's
down at the Four-acres Park.--Winna ye light down and bide a blink, sir?Or would ye take a mouthfu' o' bread and cheese, or a drink o' ale, till
our gudeman comes.It's gude ale, though I shouldna say sae that brews
it; but ploughmanlads work hard, and maun hae something to keep their
hearts abune by ordinar, sae I aye pit a gude gowpin o' maut to the
browst."As the stranger declined her courteous offers, Cuddie, the reader's old
acquaintance, made his appearance in person.His countenance still
presented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles,
which indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe.He looked
on the rider as on one whom he never had before seen, and, like his
daughter and wife, opened the conversation with the regular query,
"What's your wull wi' me, sir?""I have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country," said the
traveller, "and I was directed to you as an intelligent man who can
answer them.""Nae doubt, sir," said Cuddie, after a moment's hesitation."But I would
first like to ken what sort of questions they are.I hae had sae mony
questions speered at me in my day, and in sic queer ways, that if ye kend
a', ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a' thing about them.My mother gar 'd
me learn the Single Carritch, whilk was a great vex; then I behoved to
learn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy; and
whiles I jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o' them; and when I cam
to man's yestate, cam another kind o' questioning in fashion that I liked
waur than Effectual Calling; and the 'did promise and vow' of the tape
were yokit to the end o' the tother.Sae ye see, sir, I aye like to hear
questions asked befor I answer them.""You have nothing to apprehend from mine, my good friend; they only
relate to the state of the country."replied Cuddie; "ou, the country's weel eneugh, an it werena
that dour deevil, Claver'se (they ca' him Dundee now), that's stirring
about yet in the Highlands, they say, wi' a' the Donalds and Duncans and
Dugalds, that ever wore bottomless breeks, driving about wi' him, to set
things asteer again, now we hae gotten them a' reasonably weel settled.But Mackay will pit him down, there's little doubt o' that; he'll gie him
his fairing, I'll be caution for it.""What makes you so positive of that, my friend?""I heard it wi' my ain lugs," answered Cuddie, "foretauld to him by a man
that had been three hours stane dead, and came back to this earth again
just to tell him his mind.It was at a place they ca' Drumshinnel.""I can hardly believe you, my friend.""Ye might ask my mither, then, if she were in life," said Cuddie; "it was
her explained it a' to me, for I thought the man had only been wounded.At ony rate, he spake of the casting out of the Stewarts by their very
names, and the vengeance that was brewing for Claver'se and his dragoons.They ca'd the man Habakkuk Mucklewrath; his brain was a wee ajee, but he
was a braw preacher for a' that.""You seem," said the stranger, "to live in a rich and peaceful country.""It's no to compleen o', sir, an we get the crap weel in," quoth Cuddie;
"but if ye had seen the blude rinnin' as fast on the tap o' that brigg
yonder as ever the water ran below it, ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie
a spectacle."I was waiting upon Monmouth that
morning, my good friend, and did see some part of the action," said the
stranger."Then ye saw a bonny stour," said Cuddie, "that sail serve me for
fighting a' the days o' my life.I judged ye wad be a trooper, by your
red scarlet lace-coat and your looped hat.""And which side were you upon, my friend?"continued the inquisitive
stranger.retorted Cuddie, with a knowing look, or what he designed for
such,--"there's nae use in telling that, unless I kend wha was asking
me.""I commend your prudence, but it is unnecessary; I know you acted on that
occasion as servant to Henry Morton."said Cuddie, in surprise, "how came ye by that secret?No that I
need care a bodee about it, for the sun's on our side o' the hedge now.I
wish my master were living to get a blink o't.""He was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary Holland,--clean lost; and
a' body perished, and my poor master amang them.Neither man nor mouse
was ever heard o' mair.""You had some regard for him, then?"His face was made of a fiddle, as they say, for a'
body that looked on him liked him.Oh, an ye
had but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing
dragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till 't!There was he
and that sour Whigamore they ca'd Burley: if twa men could hae won a
field, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day.""You mention Burley: do you know if he yet lives?"Folk say he was abroad, and our sufferers wad
hold no communion wi' him, because o' his having murdered the archbishop.Sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever, and broke aff wi' mony o' the
Presbyterians; and at this last coming of the Prince of Orange he could
get nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper, and he
hasna been heard of since; only some folk say that pride and anger hae
driven him clean wud.""And--and," said the traveller, after considerable hesitation,--"do you
know anything of Lord Evan dale?""<DW37> I ken onything o' Lord Evandale?Is not my young leddy up
by yonder at the house, that's as gude as married to him?""No, only what they ca' betrothed,--me and my wife were witnesses.It's
no mony months bypast; it was a lang courtship,--few folk kend the reason
by Jenny and mysell.I downa bide to see ye
sitting up there, and the clouds are casting up thick in the west ower
Glasgow-ward, and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain."In fact, a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun; a few
large drops of rain fell, and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard."The deil's in this man," said Cuddie to himself; "I wish he would either
light aff or ride on, that he may quarter himsell in Hamilton or the
shower begin."But the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after
his last question, like one exhausted by some uncommon effort.At length,
recovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort, he asked
Cuddie "if Lady Margaret Bellenden still lived.""She does," replied Cuddie, "but in a very sma' way.They hae been a sad
changed family since thae rough times began; they hae suffered eneugh
first and last,--and to lose the auld Tower and a' the bonny barony and
the holms that I hae pleughed sae often, and the Mains, and my kale-yard,
that I suld hae gotten back again, and a' for naething, as 'a body may
say, but just the want o' some bits of sheep-skin that were lost in the
confusion of the taking of Tillietudlem.""I have heard something of this," said the stranger, deepening his voice
and averting his head."I have some interest in the family, and would
willingly help them if I could.Can you give me a bed in your house
to-night, my friend?""It's but a corner of a place, sir," said Cuddie, "but we'se try, rather
than ye suld ride on in the rain and thunner; for, to be free wi' ye,
sir, I think ye seem no that ower weel.""I am liable to a dizziness," said the stranger, "but it will soon wear
off.""I ken we can gie ye a decent supper, sir," said Cuddie; "and we'll see
about a bed as weel as we can.We wad be laith a stranger suld lack what
we have, though we are jimply provided for in beds rather; for Jenny has
sae mony bairns (God bless them and her) that troth I maun speak to Lord
Evandale to gie us a bit eik, or outshot o' some sort, to the onstead.""I shall be easily accommodated," said the stranger, as he entered the
house."And ye may rely on your naig being weel sorted," said Cuddie; "I ken
weel what belangs to suppering a horse, and this is a very gude ane."Cuddie took the horse to the little cow-house, and called to his wife to
attend in the mean while to the stranger's accommodation.The officer
entered, and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire,
and carefully turning his back to the little lattice window.Headrigg, if the reader pleases, requested him to lay aside the
cloak, belt, and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey, but he
excused himself under pretence of feeling cold, and, to divert the time
till Cuddie's return, he entered into some chat with the children,
carefully avoiding, during the interval, the inquisitive glances of his
landlady.Our broken friendships we deplore,
                    And loves of youth that are no more.Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with a cheerful voice, "that
the horse was properly suppered up, and that the gudewife should make a
bed up for him at the house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the
like o' them could gie him."said the stranger, with an interrupted and
broken voice."No, stir, they're awa wi' a' the servants,--they keep only twa nowadays,
and my gudewife there has the keys and the charge, though she's no a
fee'd servant.She has been born and bred in the family, and has a' trust
and management.If they were there, we behovedna to take sic freedom
without their order; but when they are awa, they will be weel pleased we
serve a stranger gentleman.Miss Bellenden wad help a' the haill warld,
an her power were as gude as her will; and her grandmother, Leddy
Margaret, has an unto respect for the gentry, and she's no ill to the
poor bodies neither.--And now, wife, what for are ye no getting forrit
wi' the sowens?""Never mind, lad," rejoined Jenny, "ye sall hae them in gude time; I ken
weel that ye like your brose het."Cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at
this repartee, which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence
betwixt his wife and him, in which the stranger took no share.At length
he suddenly interrupted them by the question: "Can you tell me when Lord
Evandale's marriage takes place?""Very soon, we expect," answered Jenny, before it was possible for her
husband to reply; "it wad hae been ower afore now, but for the death o'
auld Major Bellenden."said the stranger; "I heard at Edinburgh he was
no more."He couldna be said to haud up his head after his brother's wife and his
niece were turned out o' their ain house; and he had himsell sair
borrowing siller to stand the law,--but it was in the latter end o' King
James's days; and Basil Olifant, who claimed the estate, turned a <DW7>
to please the managers, and then naething was to be refused him.Sae the
law gaed again the leddies at last, after they had fought a weary sort o'
years about it; and, as I said before, the major ne'er held up his head
again.And then cam the pitting awa o' the Stewart line; and, though he
had but little reason to like them, he couldna brook that, and it clean
broke the heart o' him; and creditors cam to Charnwood and cleaned out a'
that was there,--he was never rich, the gude auld man, for he dow'd na
see onybody want.""He was indeed," said the stranger, with a faltering voice, "an admirable
man,--that is, I have heard that he was so.So the ladies were left
without fortune, as well as without a protector?""They will neither want the tane nor the tother while Lord Evandale
lives," said Jenny; "he has been a true friend in their griefs.E'en to
the house they live in is his lordship's; and never man, as my auld
gudemother used to say, since the days of the Patriarch Jacob, served sae
lang and sae sair for a wife as gude Lord Evandale has dune.""And why," said the stranger, with a voice that quivered with emotion,
"why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment?""There was the lawsuit to be ended," said Jenny readily, "forby many
other family arrangements.""Na, but," said Cuddie, "there was another reason forby; for the young
leddy--"

"Whisht, hand your tongue, and sup your sowens," said his wife; "I see
the gentleman's far frae weel, and downa eat our coarse supper.I wad
kill him a chicken in an instant.""There is no occasion," said the stranger; "I shall want only a glass of
water, and to be left alone.""You'll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me," said Jenny, lighting
a small lantern, "and I'll show you the way."Cuddie also proffered his assistance; but his wife reminded him, "That
the bairns would be left to fight thegither, and coup ane anither into
the fire," so that he remained to take charge of the menage.His wife led the way up a little winding path, which, after threading
some thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle, conducted to the back-door
of a small garden.Jenny undid the latch, and they passed through an
old-fashioned flower-garden, with its clipped yew hedges and formal
parterres, to a glass-sashed door, which she opened with a master-key,
and lighting a candle, which she placed upon a small work-table, asked
pardon for leaving him there for a few minutes, until she prepared his
apartment.She did not exceed five minutes in these preparations; but
when she returned, was startled to find that the stranger had sunk
forward with his head upon the table, in what she at first apprehended to
be a swoon.As she advanced to him, however, she could discover by his
short-drawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony.She prudently
drew back until he raised his head, and then showing herself, without
seeming to have observed his agitation, informed him that his bed was
prepared.The stranger gazed at her a moment, as if to collect the sense
of her words.She repeated them; and only bending his head, as an
indication that he understood her, he entered the apartment, the door of
which she pointed out to him.It was a small bedchamber, used, as she
informed him, by Lord Evandale when a guest at Fairy Knowe, connecting,
on one side, with a little china-cabinet which opened to the garden, and
on the other, with a saloon, from which it was only separated by a thin
wainscot partition.Having wished the stranger better health and good
rest, Jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion.she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered, "I doubt
we're ruined folk!"returned the imperturbed
Cuddie, who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at
anything."Wha d' ye think yon gentleman is?Oh that ever ye suld hae asked him to
light here!""Why, wha the muckle deil d'ye say he is?There's nae law against
harbouring and intercommunicating now," said Cuddie; "sae, Whig or Tory,
what need we care wha he be?""Ay, but it's ane will ding Lord Evandale's marriage ajee yet, if it's
no the better looked to," said Jenny; "it's Miss Edith's first joe, your
ain auld maister, Cuddie."exclaimed Cuddie, starting up, "Crow ye that I am
blind?"Ay, but, Cuddie lad," replied Jenny, "though ye are no blind, ye are no
sae notice-taking as I am.""Weel, what for needs ye cast that up to me just now; or what did ye see
about the man that was like our Maister Harry?""I jaloused his keeping his face frae us,
and speaking wi' a madelike voice, sae I e'en tried him wi' some tales
o lang syne; and when I spake o' the brose, ye ken, he didna just
laugh,--he's ower grave for that nowadays, but he gae a gledge wi' his
ee that I kend he took up what I said.And a' his distress is about Miss
Edith's marriage; and I ne'er saw a man mair taen down wi' true love in
my days,--I might say man or woman, only I mind how ill Miss Edith was
when she first gat word that him and you (ye muckle graceless loon) were
coming against Tillietudlem wi' the rebels.--But what's the matter wi'
the man now?""What's the matter wi' me indeed!"said Cuddie, who was again hastily
putting on some of the garments he had stripped himself of; "am I no gaun
up this instant to see my maister?""Atweel, Cuddie, ye are gaun nae sic gate," said Jenny, coolly and
resolutely."D 'ye think I am to be John
Tamson's man, and maistered by women a' the days o' my life?""And whase man wad ye be?And wha wad ye hae to maister ye but me,
Cuddie, lad?""I'll gar ye comprehend in the making of a
hay-band.Naebody kens that this young gentleman is living but oursells;
and frae that he keeps himsell up sae close, I am judging that he's
purposing, if he fand Miss Edith either married, or just gaun to be
married, he wad just slide awa easy, and gie them nae mair trouble.But
if Miss Edith kend that he was living, and if she were standing before
the very minister wi' Lord Evandale when it was tauld to her, I'se
warrant she wad say No when she suld say Yes.""Weel," replied Cuddie, "and what's my business wi' that?If Miss Edith
likes her auld joe better than her new ane, what for suld she no be free
to change her mind like other folk?Ye ken, Jenny, Halliday aye threeps
he had a promise frae yoursell.""Halliday's a liar, and ye're naething but a gomeril to hearken till him,
Cuddie.And then for this leddy's choice, lack-a-day!ye may be sure a'
the gowd Mr.Morton has is on the outside o' his coat; and how can he
keep Leddy Margaret and the young leddy?""Nae doubt the auld laird left his
housekeeper the liferent, as he heard nought o' his nephew; but it's but
speaking the auld wife fair, and they may a' live brawly thegither, Leddy
Margaret and a'.""Rout tout, lad," replied Jenny; "ye ken them little to think leddies o'
their rank wad set up house wi' auld Ailie Wilson, when they're maist
ower proud to take favours frae Lord Evandale himsell.Na, na, they maun
follow the camp, if she tak Morton.""That wad sort ill wi' the auld leddy, to be sure," said Cuddie; "she wad
hardly win ower a lang day in the baggage-wain.""Then sic a flyting as there wad be between them, a' about Whig and
Tory," continued Jenny."To be sure," said Cuddie, "the auld leddy's unto kittle in thae
points.""And then, Cuddie," continued his helpmate, who had reserved her
strongest argument to the last, "if this marriage wi' Lord Evandale is
broken off, what comes o' our ain bit free house, and the kale-yard, and
the cow's grass?I trow that baith us and thae bonny bairns will be
turned on the wide warld!"Here Jenny began to whimper; Cuddie writhed himself this way and that
way, the very picture of indecision.At length he broke out, "Weel,
woman, canna ye tell us what we suld do, without a' this din about it?""Just do naething at a'," said Jenny."Never seem to ken onything about
this gentleman, and for your life say a word that he suld hae been here,
or up at the house!An I had kend, I wad hae gien him my ain bed, and
sleepit in the byre or he had gane up by; but it canna be helpit now.The
neist thing's to get him cannily awa the morn, and I judge he'll be in
nae hurry to come back again."said Cuddie; "and maun I no speak to him, then?""For your life, no," said Jenny."Ye're no obliged to ken him; and I
wadna hae tauld ye, only I feared ye wad ken him in the morning.""Aweel," said Cuddie, sighing heavily, "I'se awa to pleugh the outfield
then; for if I am no to speak to him, I wad rather be out o' the gate.""Very right, my dear hinny," replied Jenny."Naebody has better sense than
you when ye crack a bit wi' me ower your affairs; but ye suld ne'er do
onything aff hand out o' your ain head.""Ane wad think it's true," quoth Cuddie; "for I hae aye had some carline
or quean or another to gar me gang their gate instead o' my ain.There
was first my mither," he continued, as he undressed and tumbled himself
into bed; "then there was Leddy Margaret didna let me ca' my soul my ain;
then my mither and her quarrelled, and pu'ed me twa ways at anes, as if
ilk ane had an end o' me, like Punch and the Deevil rugging about the
Baker at the fair; and now I hae gotten a wife," he murmured in
continuation, as he stowed the blankets around his person, "and she's
like to tak the guiding o' me a' thegither.""And amna I the best guide ye ever had in a' your life?"said Jenny, as
she closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and
extinguishing the candle.Leaving this couple to their repose, we have next to inform the reader
that, early on the next morning, two ladies on horseback, attended by
their servants, arrived at the house of Fairy Knowe, whom, to Jenny's
utter confusion, she instantly recognised as Miss Bellenden and Lady
Emily Hamilton, a sister of Lord Evandale."Had I no better gang to the house to put things to rights?"said Jenny,
confounded with this unexpected apparition."We want nothing but the pass-key," said Miss Bellenden; "Gudyill will
open the windows of the little parlour.""The little parlour's locked, and the lock's, spoiled," answered Jenny,
who recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the
bedchamber of her guest."In the red parlour, then," said Miss Bellenden, and rode up to the front
of the house, but by an approach different from that through which Morton
had been conducted."All will be out," thought Jenny, "unless I can get him smuggled out of
the house the back way."So saying, she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty."I had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there," was her next
natural reflection."But then they wad hae been for asking him to
breakfast.what will I do?--And there's Gudyill walking in
the garden too!"she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket; "and
I daurna gang in the back way till he's aff the coast.In this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler, with the
purpose of decoying him out of the garden.But John Gudyill's temper was
not improved by his decline in rank and increase in years.Like many
peevish people, too, he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what
was most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with; and, on the
present occasion, all Jenny's efforts to remove him from the garden
served only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the
shrubs.Unluckily, also, he had commenced florist during his residence at Fairy
Knowe; and, leaving all other things to the charge of Lady Emily's
servant, his first care was dedicated to the flowers, which he had taken
under his special protection, and which he propped, dug, and watered,
prosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor Jenny, who
stood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety, fear, and
impatience.Fate seemed determined to win a match against Jenny this unfortunate
morning.As soon as the ladies entered the house, they observed that the
door of the little parlour--the very apartment out of which she was
desirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in
which Morton slept--was not only unlocked, but absolutely ajar.Miss
Bellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of
reflection to take much notice of the circumstance, but, desiring the
servant to open the window-shutters, walked into the room along with her
friend."He is not yet come," she said.Why
express so anxious a wish that we should meet him here?And why not come
to Castle Dinnan, as he proposed?I own, my dear Emily, that, even
engaged as we are to each other, and with the sanction of your presence,
I do not feel that I have done quite right in indulging him.""Evandale was never capricious," answered his sister; "I am sure he will
satisfy us with his reasons, and if he does not, I will help you to scold
him.""What I chiefly fear," said Edith, "is his having engaged in some of the
plots of this fluctuating and unhappy time.I know his heart is with that
dreadful Claverhouse and his army, and I believe he would have joined
them ere now but for my uncle's death, which gave him so much additional
trouble on our account.How singular that one so rational and so deeply
sensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all
for their restoration!"answered Lady Emily,--"it is a point of honour with
Evandale.Our family have always been loyal; he served long in the
Guards; the Viscount of Dundee was his commander and his friend for
years; he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations, who
set down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit.You must be
aware, my dear Edith, how often family connections and early
predilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments.But I
trust Evandale will continue quiet,--though, to tell you truth, I believe
you are the only one who can keep him so.""You can furnish him with the Scriptural apology for not going forth with
the host,--'he has married a wife, and therefore cannot come.'""I have promised," said Edith, in a faint voice; "but I trust I shall not
be urged on the score of time.""Nay," said Lady Emily, "I will leave Evandale (and here he comes) to
plead his own cause.""Stay, stay, for God's sake!"said Edith, endeavouring to detain her."Not I, not I," said the young lady, making her escape; "the third person
makes a silly figure on such occasions.When you want me for breakfast, I
will be found in the willow-walk by the river."As she tripped out of the room, Lord Evandale entered."Good-morrow,
Brother, and good-by till breakfast-time," said the lively young lady;
"I trust you will give Miss Bellenden some good reasons for disturbing
her rest so early in the morning."And so saying, she left them together, without waiting a reply."And now, my lord," said Edith, "may I desire to know the meaning of your
singular request to meet you here at so early an hour?"She was about to add that she hardly felt herself excusable in having
complied with it; but upon looking at the person whom she addressed, she
was struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his
countenance, and interrupted herself to exclaim, "For God's sake, what is
the matter?""His Majesty's faithful subjects have gained a great and most decisive
victory near Blair of Athole; but, alas!my gallant friend Lord Dundee--"

"Has fallen?"said Edith, anticipating the rest of his tidings."True, most true: he has fallen in the arms of victory, and not a man
remains of talents and influence sufficient to fill up his loss in King
James's service.This, Edith, is no time for temporizing with our duty.I
have given directions to raise my followers, and I must take leave of you
this evening.""Do not think of it, my lord," answered Edith; "your life is--essential
to your friends,--do not throw it away in an adventure so rash.What can
your single arm, and the few tenants or servants who might follow you, do
against the force of almost all Scotland, the Highland clans only
excepted?""Listen to me, Edith," said Lord Evandale."I am not so rash as you may
suppose me, nor are my present motives of such light importance as to
affect only those personally dependent on myself.The Life Guards, with
whom I served so long, although new-modelled and new-officered by the
Prince of Orange, retain a predilection for the cause of their rightful
master; and "--and here he whispered as if he feared even the walls of
the apartment had ears--"when my foot is known to be in the stirrup, two
regiments of cavalry have sworn to renounce the usurper's service, and
fight under my orders.They delayed only till Dundee should descend into
the Lowlands; but since he is no more, which of his successors dare take
that decisive step, unless encouraged by the troops declaring themselves!Meantime, the zeal of the soldiers will die away.I must bring them to a
decision while their hearts are glowing with the victory their old leader
has obtained, and burning to avenge his untimely death.""And will you, on the faith of such men as you know these soldiers to
be," said Edith, "take a part of such dreadful moment?""I will," said Lord Evandale,--"I must; my honour and loyalty are both
pledged for it.""And all for the sake," continued Miss Bellenden, "of a prince whose
measures, while he was on the throne, no one could condemn more than Lord
Evandale?""Most true," replied Lord Evandale; "and as I resented, even during the
plenitude of his power, his innovations on Church and State, like a
freeborn subject, I am determined I will assert his real rights, when he
is in adversity, like a loyal one.Let courtiers and sycophants flatter
power and desert misfortune; I will neither do the one nor the other.""And if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term
rashly, why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting?""Were it not enough to answer," said Lord Evandale, "that, ere rushing on
battle, I wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride?Surely it is judging
coldly of my feelings, and showing too plainly the indifference of your
own, to question my motive for a request so natural.""But why in this place, my lord," said Edith; "and why with such peculiar
circumstances of mystery?""Because," he replied, putting a letter into her hand, "I have yet
another request, which I dare hardly proffer, even when prefaced by these
credentials."In haste and terror, Edith glanced over the letter, which was from her
grandmother."My dearest childe," such was its tenor in style and spelling, "I
     never more deeply regretted the reumatizm, which disqualified me
     from riding on horseback, than at this present writing, when I would
     most have wished to be where this paper will soon be, that is at
     Fairy Knowe, with my poor dear Willie's only child.But it is the
     will of God I should not be with her, which I conclude to be the
     case, as much for the pain I now suffer, as because it hath now not
     given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild
     mustard, wherewith I have often relieved others.Therefore, I must
     tell you, by writing instead of word of mouth, that, as my young
     Lord Evandale is called to the present campaign, both by his honour
     and his duty, he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy
     matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you
     and him, in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for
     that effeck, whereuntill, as I see no raisonable objexion, so I
     trust that you, who have been always a good and obedient childe,
     will not devize any which has less than raison.It is trew that the
     contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner
     more befitting our Rank, and not in private, and with few witnesses,
     as a thing done in a corner.But it has been Heaven's own free will,
     as well as those of the kingdom where we live, to take away from us
     our estate, and from the King his throne.Yet I trust He will yet
     restore the rightful heir to the throne, and turn his heart to the
     true Protestant Episcopal faith, which I have the better right to
     expect to see even with my old eyes, as I have beheld the royal
     family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers
     and rebels as they are now; that is to say, when his most sacred
     Majesty, Charles the Second of happy memory, honoured our poor house
     of Tillietudlem by taking his _disjune_ therein," etc., etc., etc.We will not abuse the reader's patience by quoting more of Lady
Margaret's prolix epistle.Suffice it to say that it closed by laying her
commands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her
marriage without loss of time."I never thought till this instant," said Edith, dropping the letter from
her hand, "that Lord Evandale would have acted ungenerously.""And how can you apply such a
term to my desire to call you mine, ere I part from you, perhaps for
ever?""Lord Evandale ought to have remembered," said Edith, "that when his
perseverance, and, I must add, a due sense of his merit and of the
obligations we owed him, wrung from me a slow consent that I would one
day comply with his wishes, I made it my condition that I should not be
pressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise; and now he avails
himself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with
precipitate and even indelicate importunity.There is more selfishness
than generosity, my lord, in such eager and urgent solicitation."Lord Evandale, evidently much hurt, took two or three turns through the
apartment ere he replied to this accusation; at length he spoke: "I
should have escaped this painful charge, durst I at once have mentioned
to Miss Bellendon my principal reason for urging this request.It is one
which she will probably despise on her own account, but which ought to
weigh with her for the sake of Lady Margaret.My death in battle must
give my whole estate to my heirs of entail; my forfeiture as a traitor,
by the usurping Government, may vest it in the Prince of Orange or some
Dutch favourite.In either case, my venerable friend and betrothed bride
must remain unprotected and in poverty.Vested with the rights and
provisions of Lady Evandale, Edith will find, in the power of supporting
her aged parent, some consolation for having condescended to share the
titles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her."Edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected, and was
compelled to acknowledge that Lord Evandale's suit was urged with
delicacy as well as with consideration."And yet," she said, "such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts
to former times that I cannot," she burst into tears, "suppress a degree
of ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief
summons.""We have already fully considered this painful subject," said Lord
Evandale; "and I hoped, my dear Edith, your own inquiries, as well as
mine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless."said Edith, with a deep sigh, which, as if by an
unexpected echo, was repeated from the adjoining apartment.Miss
Bellenden started at the sound, and scarcely composed herself upon Lord
Evandale's assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own
respiration."It sounded strangely distinct," she said, "and almost ominous; but my
feelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them."Lord Evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm, and reconcile her to
a measure which, however hasty, appeared to him the only means by which
he could secure her independence.He urged his claim in virtue of the
contract, her grandmother's wish and command, the propriety of insuring
her comfort and independence, and touched lightly on his own long
attachment, which he had evinced by so many and such various services.These Edith felt the more, the less they were insisted upon; and at
length, as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour, excepting a causeless
reluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much
generosity, she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having
the ceremony performed upon such hasty notice, at such a time and place.But for all this Lord Evandale was prepared, and he explained, with
joyful alacrity, that the former chaplain of his regiment was in
attendance at the Lodge with a faithful domestic, once a non-commissioned
officer in the same corps; that his sister was also possessed of the
secret; and that Headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of
witnesses, if agreeable to Miss Bellenden.As to the place, he had chosen
it on very purpose.The marriage was to remain a secret, since Lord
Evandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnized,--a
circumstance which, had their union been public, must have drawn upon him
the attention of the Government, as being altogether unaccountable,
unless from his being engaged in some dangerous design.Having hastily
urged these motives and explained his arrangements, he ran, without
waiting for an answer, to summon his sister to attend his bride, while he
went in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary.When Lady Emily arrived, she found her friend in an agony of tears, of
which she was at some loss to comprehend the reason, being one of those
damsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in
matrimony, and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could
not be rendered peculiarly alarming by Lord Evandale being the
bridegroom.Influenced by these feelings, she exhausted in succession all
the usual arguments for courage, and all the expressions of sympathy and
condolence ordinarily employed on such occasions.But when Lady Emily
beheld her future sister-in-law deaf to all those ordinary topics of
consolation; when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission
down cheeks as pale as marble; when she felt that the hand which she
pressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp,
and lay, like that of a corpse, insensible and unresponsive to her
caresses, her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and
pettish displeasure."I must own," she said, "that I am something at a loss to understand all
this, Miss Bellenden.Months have passed since you agreed to marry my
brother, and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from
one period to another, as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or
highly disagreeable connection.I think I can answer for Lord Evandale
that he will seek no woman's hand against her inclination; and, though
his sister, I may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady
further than her inclinations carry her.You will forgive me, Miss
Bellenden; but your present distress augurs ill for my brother's future
happiness, and I must needs say that he does not merit all these
expressions of dislike and dolour, and that they seem an odd return for
an attachment which he has manifested so long, and in so many ways.""You are right, Lady Emily," said Edith, drying her eyes and endeavouring
to resume her natural manner, though still betrayed by her faltering
voice and the paleness of her cheeks,--"you are quite right; Lord
Evandale merits such usage from no one, least of all from her whom he has
honoured with his regard.But if I have given way, for the last time, to
a sudden and irresistible burst of feeling, it is my consolation, Lady
Emily, that your brother knows the cause, that I have hid nothing from
him, and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in Edith
Bellenden a wife undeserving of his affection.But still you are right,
and I merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and
painful remembrances.It shall be so no longer; my lot is cast with
Evandale, and with him I am resolved to bear it.Nothing shall in future
occur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations; no
idle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous
and affectionate discharge of my duty; no vain illusions recall the
memory of other days--"

As she spoke these words, she slowly raised her eyes, which had before
been hidden by her hand, to the latticed window of her apartment, which
was partly open, uttered a dismal shriek, and fainted.Lady Emily turned
her eyes in the same direction, but saw only the shadow of a man, which
seemed to disappear from the window, and, terrified more by the state of
Edith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed, she uttered
shriek upon shriek for assistance.Her brother soon arrived, with the
chaplain and Jenny Dennison; but strong and vigorous remedies were
necessary ere they could recall Miss Bellenden to sense and motion.Even
then her language was wild and incoherent.[Illustration: Uttered A Dismal Shriek, And Fainted--224]


"Press me no farther," she said to Lord Evandale,--"it cannot be; Heaven
and earth, the living and the dead, have leagued themselves against this
ill-omened union.Take all I can give,--my sisterly regard, my devoted
friendship.I will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman,
but never speak to me more of marriage."The astonishment of Lord Evandale may easily be conceived."Emily," he said to his sister, "this is your doing.I was accursed when
I thought of bringing you here; some of your confounded folly has driven
her mad!""On my word, Brother," answered Lady Emily, "you're sufficient to drive
all the women in Scotland mad.Because your mistress seems much disposed
to jilt you, you quarrel with your sister, who has been arguing in your
cause, and had brought her to a quiet hearing, when, all of a sudden, a
man looked in at a window, whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for
you or some one else, and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic
scene."said Lord Evandale, in impatient displeasure."Miss Bellenden is incapable of trifling with me; and yet what else could
have--"

"Hush!said Jenny, whose interest lay particularly in shifting
further inquiry; "for Heaven's sake, my lord, speak low, for my lady
begins to recover."Edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged, in a
feeble voice, to be left alone with Lord Evandale.All retreated,--Jenny
with her usual air of officious simplicity, Lady Emily and the chaplain
with that of awakened curiosity.No sooner had they left the apartment
than Edith beckoned Lord Evandale to sit beside her on the couch; her
next motion was to take his hand, in spite of his surprised resistance,
to her lips; her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees.I must deal most
untruly by you, and break a solemn engagement.You have my friendship, my
highest regard, my most sincere gratitude; you have more,--you have my
word and my faith; but--oh, forgive me, for the fault is not mine--you
have not my love, and I cannot marry you without a sin!""You dream, my dearest Edith!"said Evandale, perplexed in the utmost
degree, "you let your imagination beguile you; this is but some delusion
of an over-sensitive mind.The person whom you preferred to me has been
long in a better world, where your unavailing regret cannot follow him,
or, if it could, would only diminish his happiness.""You are mistaken, Lord Evandale," said Edith, solemnly; "I am not a
sleep-walker or a madwoman.No, I could not have believed from any one
what I have seen.But, having seen him, I must believe mine own eyes."asked Lord Evandale, in great anxiety."Henry Morton," replied Edith, uttering these two words as if they were
her last, and very nearly fainting when she had done so."Miss Bellenden," said Lord Evandale, "you treat me like a fool or a
child.If you repent your engagement to me," he continued, indignantly,
"I am not a man to enforce it against your inclination; but deal with me
as a man, and forbear this trifling."He was about to go on, when he perceived, from her quivering eye and
pallid cheek, that nothing less than imposture was intended, and that by
whatever means her imagination had been so impressed, it was really
disturbed by unaffected awe and terror.He changed his tone, and exerted
all his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the
secret cause of such terror.she repeated,--"I saw Henry Morton stand at that window, and
look into the apartment at the moment I was on the point of abjuring him
for ever.His face was darker, thinner, and paler than it was wont to be;
his dress was a horseman's cloak, and hat looped down over his face; his
expression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was
examined by Claverhouse at Tillietudlem.Ask your sister, ask Lady Emily,
if she did not see him as well as I. I know what has called him up,--he
came to upbraid me, that, while my heart was with him in the deep and
dead sea, I was about to give my hand to another.My lord, it is ended
between you and me; be the consequences what they will, she cannot marry
whose union disturbs the repose of the dead."said Evandale, as he paced the room, half mad himself with
surprise and vexation, "her fine understanding must be totally
overthrown, and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my
ill-timed, though well-meant, request.Without rest and attention her
health is ruined for ever."At this moment the door opened, and Halliday, who had been Lord
Evandale's principal personal attendant since they both left the Guards
on the Revolution, stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and
ghastly as terror could paint it."What is the matter next, Halliday?""Any
discovery of the--"

He had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the
dangerous sentence."No, sir," said Halliday, "it is not that, nor anything like that; but I
have seen a ghost!"said Lord Evandale, forced altogether out
of his patience."Has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me
so?"The ghost of Henry Morton, the Whig captain at Bothwell Bridge," replied
Halliday."He passed by me like a fire-flaught when I was in the garden!""This is midsummer madness," said Lord Evandale, "or there is some
strange villainy afloat.Jenny, attend your lady to her chamber, while I
endeavour to find a clue to all this."But Lord Evandale's inquiries were in vain.Jenny, who might have given
(had she chosen) a very satisfactory explanation, had an interest to
leave the matter in darkness; and interest was a matter which now weighed
principally with Jenny, since the possession of an active and
affectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her
spirit of coquetry.She had made the best use of the first moments of
confusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the
apartment adjoining to the parlour, and even to erase the mark of
footsteps beneath the window, through which she conjectured Morton's face
had been seen, while attempting, ere he left the garden, to gain one look
at her whom he had so long loved, and was now on the point of losing for
ever.That he had passed Halliday in the garden was equally clear; and
she learned from her elder boy, whom she had employed to have the
stranger's horse saddled and ready for his departure, that he had rushed
into the stable, thrown the child a broad gold piece, and, mounting his
horse, had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the Clyde.The
secret was, therefore, in their own family, and Jenny was resolved it
should remain so."For, to be sure," she said, "although her lady and Halliday kend Mr.Morton by broad daylight, that was nae reason I suld own to kenning him
in the gloaming and by candlelight, and him keeping his face frae Cuddie
and me a' the time."So she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by Lord Evandale.As for Halliday, he could only say that as he entered the garden-door,
the supposed apparition met him, walking swiftly, and with a visage on
which anger and grief appeared to be contending."He knew him well," he said, "having been repeatedly guard upon him, and
obliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape.But what should make him
haunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot, he, the said
Halliday, did not pretend to conceive.Lady Emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window, but
her evidence went no farther.John Gudyill deponed _nil novit in causa_.He had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when
the apparition had taken place.Lady Emily's servant was waiting orders
in the kitchen, and there was not another being within a quarter of a
mile of the house.Lord Evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree
at beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the
protection of Edith in contingent circumstances, than for the assurance
of his own happiness, and which he had brought so very near perfection,
thus broken off without any apparent or rational cause.His knowledge of
Edith's character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious
change of determination by a pretended vision.But he would have set the
apparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination, agitated
by the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed, had it not
been for the coinciding testimony of Halliday, who had no reason for
thinking of Morton more than any other person, and knew nothing of Miss
Bellenden's vision when he promulgated his own.On the other hand, it
seemed in the highest degree improbable that Morton, so long and so
vainly sought after, and who was, with such good reason, supposed to be
lost when the "Vryheid" of Rotterdam went down with crew and passengers,
should be alive and lurking in this country, where there was no longer
any reason why he should not openly show himself, since the present
Government favoured his party in politics.When Lord Evandale reluctantly
brought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain, in order to
obtain his opinion, he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology, in
which, after quoting Delrio and Burthoog and De L'Ancre on the subject of
apparitions, together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the
nature of testimony, the learned gentleman expressed his definite and
determined opinion to be, either that there had been an actual apparition
of the deceased Henry Morton's spirit, the possibility of which he was,
as a divine and a philosopher, neither fully prepared to admit or to
deny; or else that the said Henry Morton, being still in _rerum natura_,
had appeared in his proper person that morning; or, finally, that some
strong _deceptio visus_, or striking similitude of person, had deceived
the eyes of Miss Bellenden and of Thomas Halliday.Which of these was the
most probable hypothesis, the doctor declined to pronounce, but expressed
himself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had
occasioned that morning's disturbance.Lord Evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety.Miss
Bellenden was declared to be dangerously ill."I will not leave this place," he exclaimed, "till she is pronounced to
be in safety.I neither can nor ought to do so; for whatever may have
been the immediate occasion of her illness, I gave the first cause for it
by my unhappy solicitation."He established himself, therefore, as a guest in the family, which the
presence of his sister, as well as of Lady Margaret Bellenden (who, in
despite of her rheumatism, caused herself to be transported thither when
she heard of her granddaughter's illness), rendered a step equally
natural and delicate.And thus he anxiously awaited until, without injury
to her health, Edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure
on his expedition."She shall never," said the generous young man, "look on her engagement
with me as the means of fettering her to a union, the idea of which seems
almost to unhinge her understanding."Where once my careless childhood strayed,
               A stranger yet to pain.Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College.It is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most
distinguished talents are levelled, during their lifetime, with the
common mass of mankind.There are periods of mental agitation when the
firmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren, and
when, in paying the general tax of humanity, his distresses are even
aggravated by feeling that he transgresses, in the indulgence of his
grief, the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in
general to regulate his passions and his actions.It was during such a
paroxysm that the unfortunate Morton left Fairy Knowe.To know that his
long-loved and still-beloved Edith, whose image had filled his mind for
so many years, was on the point of marriage to his early rival, who had
laid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to
refuse his addresses, bitter as the intelligence was, yet came not as an
unexpected blow.During his residence abroad he had once written to Edith.It was to bid
her farewell for ever, and to conjure her to forget him.He had requested
her not to answer his letter; yet he half hoped, for many a day, that she
might transgress his injunction.The letter never reached her to whom it
was addressed, and Morton, ignorant of its miscarriage, could only
conclude himself laid aside and forgotten, according to his own
self-denying request.All that he had heard of their mutual relations
since his return to Scotland prepared him to expect that he could only
look upon Miss Bellenden as the betrothed bride of Lord Evandale; and
even if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter, it would still
have been inconsistent with Morton's generosity of disposition to disturb
their arrangements, by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by
absence, never sanctioned by the consent of friends, and barred by a
thousand circumstances of difficulty.Why then did he seek the cottage
which their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of Lady Margaret
Bellenden and her granddaughter?He yielded, we are under the necessity
of acknowledging, to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might
have felt in his situation.Accident apprised him, while travelling towards his native district, that
the ladies, near whose mansion he must necessarily pass, were absent; and
learning that Cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics, he
could not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real
progress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen
den--alas!This rash experiment ended as we have
related, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious that he
was still beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to
relinquish her for ever.With what feelings he must have listened to the
dialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he
involuntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not
attempt to describe them.An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon
their interview, or to exclaim aloud, "Edith, I yet live!"and as often
the recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude
which he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he
justly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him
from a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress,
but gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness.He repressed
forcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his
every nerve.was his internal oath, "never will I add a thorn to thy
pillow.That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and let me not add, by
my selfish sorrows, one atom's weight to the burden thou hast to bear.I
was dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt
thou know that Henry Morton still lives!"As he formed this resolution, diffident of his own power to keep it, and
seeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his
continuing within hearing of Edith's voice, he hastily rushed from his
apartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the
garden.But firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed, he could not leave the
spot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his
ear, without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the
parlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker.It was in this attempt, made while Edith seemed to have her eyes
unalterably bent upon the ground, that Morton's presence was detected by
her raising them suddenly.So soon as her wild scream made this known to
the unfortunate object of a passion so constant, and which seemed so
ill-fated, he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies.He
passed Halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible
that he had seen him, threw himself on his horse, and, by a sort of
instinct rather than recollection, took the first by-road in preference
to the public route to Hamilton.In all probability this prevented Lord Evandale from learning that he was
actually in existence; for the news that the Highlanders had obtained a
decisive victory at Killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate look-out to
be kept, by order of the Government, on all the passes, for fear of some
commotion among the Lowland Jacobites.They did not omit to post
sentinels on Bothwell Bridge; and as these men had not seen any traveller
pass westward in that direction, and as, besides, their comrades
stationed in the village of Bothwell were equally positive that none had
gone eastward, the apparition, in the existence of which Edith and
Halliday were equally positive, became yet more mysterious in the
judgment of Lord Evandale, who was finally inclined to settle in the
belief that the heated and disturbed imagination of Edith had summoned up
the phantom she stated herself to have seen, and that Halliday had, in
some unaccountable manner, been infected by the same superstition.Meanwhile, the by-path which Morton pursued, with all the speed which his
vigorous horse could exert, brought him in a very few seconds to the
brink of the Clyde, at a spot marked with the feet of horses, who were
conducted to it as a watering-place.The steed, urged as he was to the
gallop, did not pause a single instant, but, throwing himself into the
river, was soon beyond his depth.The plunge which the animal made as his
feet quitted the ground, with the feeling that the cold water rose above
his swordbelt, were the first incidents which recalled Morton, whose
movements had been hitherto mechanical, to the necessity of taking
measures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode.A
perfect master of all manly exercises, the management of a horse in water
was as familiar to him as when upon a meadow.He directed the animal's
course somewhat down the stream towards a low plain, or holm, which
seemed to promise an easy egress from the river.In the first and second
attempt to get on shore, the horse was frustrated by the nature of the
ground, and nearly fell backwards on his rider.The instinct of
self-preservation seldom fails, even in the most desperate circumstances,
to recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise, unless when
altogether distracted by terror, and Morton was obliged to the danger in
which he was placed for complete recovery of his self-possession.A third
attempt, at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected, succeeded
better than the former, and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon
the farther and left-hand bank of the Clyde."But whither," said Morton, in the bitterness of his heart, "am I now to
direct my course?or rather, what does it signify to which point of the
compass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself?I would to God, could the
wish be without a sin, that these dark waters had flowed over me, and
drowned my recollection of that which was, and that which is!"The sense of impatience, which the disturbed state of his feelings had
occasioned, scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions, ere
he was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm.He
remembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the
bitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost
incessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public
career.he said, "and worse than a fool, to set light by that
existence which Heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous
manner.Something there yet remains for me in this world, were it only to
bear my sorrows like a man, and to aid those who need my assistance.What
have I seen, what have I heard, but the very conclusion of that which I
knew was to happen?They"--he durst not utter their names even in
soliloquy--"they are embarrassed and in difficulties.She is stripped of
her inheritance, and he seems rushing on some dangerous career, with
which, but for the low voice in which he spoke, I might have become
acquainted.Are there no means to aid or to warn them?"As he pondered upon this topic, forcibly withdrawing his mind from his
own disappointment, and compelling his attention to the affairs of Edith
and her betrothed husband, the letter of Burley, long forgotten, suddenly
rushed on his memory, like a ray of light darting through a mist."Their ruin must have been his work," was his internal conclusion."If it
can be repaired, it must be through his means, or by information obtained
from him.Stern, crafty, and enthusiastic as he
is, my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once
prevailed with him.I will seek him out, at least; and who knows what
influence the information I may acquire from him may have on the fortunes
of those whom I shall never see more, and who will probably never learn
that I am now suppressing my own grief, to add, if possible, to their
happiness."Animated by these hopes, though the foundation was but slight, he sought
the nearest way to the high-road; and as all the tracks through the
valley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth, he had no
other difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures, ere he
found himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the
popinjay had been celebrated.He journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed
and dejected, yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of
anguish; for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail
to restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness.He
turned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering
Burley, and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge
which he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested
himself; and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the
circumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest,
trusting that, from Cuddie's account of a schism betwixt Burley and his
brethren of the Presbyterian persuasion, he might find him less
rancorously disposed against Miss Bellenden, and inclined to exert the
power which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes, more
favourably than heretofore.Noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the
neighbourhood of his deceased uncle's habitation of Milnwood.It rose
among glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early
recollections of joy and sorrow, and made upon Morton that mournful
impression, soft and affecting, yet, withal, soothing, which the
sensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood
and early youth, after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests
of public life.A strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself."Old Alison," he thought, "will not know me, more than the honest couple
whom I saw yesterday.I may indulge my curiosity, and proceed on my
journey, without her having any knowledge of my existence.I think they
said my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansion,--well, be it so.I
have enough to sorrow for, to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a
disappointment as that; and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor
in my grumbling old dame, to a line of respectable, if not distinguished,
ancestry.Let it be as it may, I will visit the old mansion at least once
more."The house of Milnwood, even in its best days, had nothing cheerful about
it; but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old
housekeeper.Everything, indeed, was in repair; there were no slates
deficient upon the steep grey roof, and no panes broken in the narrow
windows.But the grass in the court-yard looked as if the foot of man had
not been there for years; the doors were carefully locked, and that which
admitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time, since
the spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the door-way and the
staples.Living sight or sound there was none, until, after much
knocking, Morton heard the little window, through which it was
usual to reconnoitre visitors, open with much caution.The face of
Alison, puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with
which it was furrowed when Morton left Scotland, now presented itself,
enveloped in a _toy_, from under the protection of which some of her grey
tresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful, while
her shrill, tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking."I wish to speak an instant with one Alison Wilson, who resides here,"
said Henry."She's no at hame the day," answered Mrs.Wilson, _in propria persona_,
the state of whose headdress, perhaps, inspired her with this direct mode
of denying herself; "and ye are but a mislear'd person to speer for her
in sic a manner.Ye might hae had an M under your belt for Mistress
Wilson of Milnwood.""I beg pardon," said Morton, internally smiling at finding in old Ailie
the same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former
occasions,--"I beg pardon; I am but a stranger in this country, and have
been so long abroad that I have almost forgotten my own language."said Ailie; "then maybe ye may hae
heard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca' Henry Morton?""I have heard," said Morton, "of such a name in Germany.""Then bide a wee bit where ye are, friend; or stay,--gang round by the
back o' the house, and ye'll find a laigh door; it's on the latch, for
it's never barred till sunset.Ye 'll open 't,--and tak care ye dinna fa'
ower the tub, for the entry's dark,--and then ye'll turn to the right,
and then ye'll hand straught forward, and then ye'll turn to the right
again, and ye 'll tak heed o' the cellarstairs, and then ye 'll be at the
door o' the little kitchen,--it's a' the kitchen that's at Milnwood
now,--and I'll come down t'ye, and whate'er ye wad say to Mistress
Wilson ye may very safely tell it to me."A stranger might have had some difficulty, notwithstanding the minuteness
of the directions supplied by Ailie, to pilot himself in safety through
the dark labyrinth of passages that led from the back-door to the little
kitchen; but Henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these
straits to experience danger, either from the Scylla which lurked on one
side in shape of a bucking tub, or the Charybdis which yawned on the
other in the profundity of a winding cellar-stair.His only impediment
arose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel,
once his own property, but which, unlike to the faithful Argus, saw his
master return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition.said Morton to himself, on being disowned by
his former favourite."I am so changed that no breathing creature that I
have known and loved will now acknowledge me!"At this moment he had reached the kitchen; and soon after, the tread of
Alison's high heels, and the pat of the crutch-handled cane which served
at once to prop and to guide her footsteps, were heard upon the
stairs,--an annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly
reached the kitchen.Morton had, therefore, time to survey the slender preparations for
housekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors.The
fire, though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood, was husbanded with
the closest attention to economy of fuel, and the small pipkin, in which
was preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maid-of-all-work, a
girl of twelve years old, intimated, by its thin and watery vapour, that
Ailie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune.When she entered, the head, which nodded with self-importance; the
features, in which an irritable peevishness, acquired by habit and
indulgence, strove with a temper naturally affectionate and good-natured;
the coif; the apron; the blue-checked gown,--were all those of old Ailie;
but laced pinners, hastily put on to meet the stranger, with some other
trifling articles of decoration, marked the difference between Mrs.Wilson, life-rentrix of Milnwood, and the housekeeper of the late
proprietor."What were ye pleased to want wi' Mrs.Wilson,"
was her first address; for the five minutes time which she had gained for
the business of the toilet entitled her, she conceived, to assume the
full merit of her illustrious name, and shine forth on her guest in
unchastened splendour.Morton's sensations, confounded between the past
and present, fairly confused him so much that he would have had
difficulty in answering her, even if he had known well what to say.But
as he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing
that which was properly his own, he had an additional reason for
remaining silent.Wilson, in perplexity, and with some apprehension,
repeated her question."What were ye pleased to want wi' me, sir?"Pardon me, madam," answered Henry, "it was of one Silas Morton I spoke.""It was his father, then, ye kent o', the brother o' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were
born.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of
the son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his
passage to Holland.""That's ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony
a tear it's cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough'd awa
wi' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the
bread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to
be handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,
frugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, 'Ailie,' (he aye
ca'd me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), 'Ailie, take ye care and haud
the gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood's gane out
like the last sough of an auld sang.'And sae he fell out o' ae dwam into
another, and ne'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou'dna
mak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi'.He
cou'd ne'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on
the table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,
Morton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the
dog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former
recollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course
of capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant
to betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could
not forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog's name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden
surprise,--"ye ken our dog's name, and it's no a common ane.And the
creature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller
tone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton's neck, cling
to him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for
joy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart
to attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most
grateful warmth, and answered,--

"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past
and present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome
me to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye'll hae mony friends,--ye 'll hae mony
friends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a
gude guide o't!she continued, pushing him back from her
with her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if
to read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather
than time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye're sair altered, hinny;
your face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny
red-and-white cheeks are turned a' dark and sun-burnt.mony's the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na
write to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did
ye come creepin' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie
poor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give
the kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our
readers in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,
               But that is gone for being Richard's friend;
               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to
Mrs.Wilson's own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as
housekeeper, and which she continued to retain."It was," she said,
"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found
dangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than
the late Milnwood's apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"
and as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,
washed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,
unless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,
they were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,
which the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,
although neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the
comfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,
informed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all
hands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the
skiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the
deck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their
inclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer
who had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going
immediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the
Stadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his
father-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the
character of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to
distinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without
forcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and
retirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of
the British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your
prudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time
had elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United
States, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the
incognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,
to be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which
the prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his
prudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of
his native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that
cannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for
you, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for
the recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss
regiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will
meet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and
let the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on
various occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the
moment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His
commands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I
wonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the
vessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with
which I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance
which must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the
Prince of Oranger's court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o'
Milnwood was kend a' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a
period when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,
Ailie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother's name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds
far bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun
tak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,
for I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from
every one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good
hands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I'm hopefu' ye are no meaning
mine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I'm ower
failed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very
pressing, and spak very civilly; but I'm ower auld a cat to draw that
strae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he's dune mony a ane.And then
I thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup
milk, and keep a' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir
uncle's time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive
and guide the gear canny.Ye'll hae learned that in Holland, I'se
warrant, for they're thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye'll be
for keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that's gave; and,
indeed, I would approve o' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as
three times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the
generosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie's thoughts and
actions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast
between her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You
must know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days
on some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,
Ailie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint
you fully with my motives and intentions.""E'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my
neighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me
where he keepit his gear, and that's what maist folk like to hae as
private as possibly may be.--But come awa wi' me, hinny, till I show ye
the oak-parlour how grandly it's keepit, just as if ye had been expected
haine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind
o' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said
to mysell, What needs I fash wi' grates and carpets and cushions and the
muckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they'll ne'er come hame that
aught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the
scrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high
state of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as
he followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his
shune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of
authority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the
feelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at
his occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed
had not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily
supposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and
long upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that
the large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green
worsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the
room looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were
two objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,
dissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety
of sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in
complete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and
determined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and
brocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely
indebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae
expensive fal-lalls that he ne'er wore in his life, instead o' his douce
Raploch grey, and his band wi' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything
approaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly
person of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done
on his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from
Ailie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own
hands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no
otherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any
event of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have
cackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the
extravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of
old times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which
she assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,
and planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as
governante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and
castle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some
fitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and
spend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered
likely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged
it--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,
and which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she
had laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them
from time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which
few persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his
new attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae
decently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than
when he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she
called "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of
a velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been
converted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and
appeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of
its transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the
necessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye
sleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was
the reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected
you would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e'er mortal een
the like o' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out
of a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper's Howff; he
can give me a bed, I suppose?"I'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for 't
into the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign
parts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith
for naething, and thanks t' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her
remonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I
may be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o'
twal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye
venturesome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took
a surer gate, and never parted wi' it when he had anes gotten 't."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and
mounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn
promise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard
from him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted
slowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,
as she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature's
heart before a week were out."Where's the jolly host
               You told me of?'T has been my custom ever
               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable
adventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more
than once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which
he had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other
respects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But
a few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that
he had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the
traces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the
raw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only
chance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,
might remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if
there was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old
celebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less
civil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as
in corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord's complaisance for his guests
decreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had
acquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances
of love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected
by a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were
particularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the
character his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse
accommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the
public room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have
been thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the
very apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory
at the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many
serious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that
festivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff
seemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly
presented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o' brandy;"
two or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the
inactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,
indeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank
a little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian
minister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in
persons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he
looked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance
renders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,
human beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with
the same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the
readiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the
smiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the
tap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down
and take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly
acceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from
every guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,
and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,
along with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he
received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor
before them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,
upon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the
change of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care
to mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton
that he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers
amang us, mair or less.There's a wheen German horse down at Glasgow
yonder; they ca' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he's
as grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and
short black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the
man.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,
considering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,
and as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar'd me stop
in the middle of Torphichen's Rant,--the best piece o' music that ever
bag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers
"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld
caterpillars; these were Claver'se's lads a while syne, and wad be again,
maybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic
a fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it's lang or the deil die.I
wad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he'll
be doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are
they then?A' thae hell-rakers o' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a
moment.Nae doubt they're Willie's men e'en now, as they were James's a
while syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae
they to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There's ae
gude thing o' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca' it,--folks may
speak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o' being hauled awa to the
guard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as
I wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress
he had made in mine host's familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation
proper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something
of importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called
Elizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord's
laugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife's (haly be her rest!)--my ain
wife's first gudeman's sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but
sair she's been trysted wi' misfortunes,--the loss o' twa decent lads o'
sons, in the time o' the persecution, as they ca' it nowadays; and
doucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and
condemning nane.If there's an honest woman in the world, it's Bessie
Maclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons
clinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,
they aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"

"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own
superior accommodations,--"a sour browst o' sma' ale that she sells to
folk that are over drouthy wi' travel to be nice; but naething to ca' a
stirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a' the night?Ye'll hardly get accommodation
at Bessie's," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife's relative by
no means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and
I only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of
his calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not
serve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure's house, and
I desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye'll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,
somewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye'll need if ye gae doun the
water for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and
then tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the
hills,--ye'll ken 't by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o' a
burn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna
miss Widow Maclure's public, for deil another house or hauld is on the
road for ten lang Scots miles, and that's worth twenty English.I am
sorry your honour would think o' gaun out o' my house the night.But my
wife's gude-sister is a decent woman, and it's no lost that a friend
gets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the
summer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the
moors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,
when Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,
he was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by
soldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman
who apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should
have become inseparably interwoven with that man's, without anything more
on my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to
Heaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of
mind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his
horse's head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had
once been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a
few, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,
or clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and
of cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to
take refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted
and decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to
indicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down
among them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and
animation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and
most savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when
gazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains
of fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road
followed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to
be distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts
of the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,
"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a
sea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when
his fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and
over.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a
shoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the
objects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession
of ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the
banks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a
croft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,
whose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green
with moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered
damage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance
of verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt
and worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might
here find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,
rude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in
approaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate
dignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that
Burley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated
by the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge
alder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress
Maclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow's cake and the widow's
cruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can
come amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better
trade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you
do not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like
that of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi'
sodgering in this puir land that I am e'en content that I can see nae
mair o't wi' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,
compassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your
profession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily
eneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look
after your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma'
matter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl
of twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman's
horse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and
shake down a lock o' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come
this way, sir," she continued; "ye'll find my house clean, though it's a
puir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,
               And fast her tears did fa
               "Ye wadna be warn'd, my son Johnie,
               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had
spoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and
was neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which
the hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Refreshments
were placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had
small occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of
maintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her
blindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of
instinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on
your guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of
Zarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh
to hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,
turning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that
is, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this
last change."said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied
the landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would
have brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of
worship to tender consciences, it's little matter what it has brought to
a puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It's a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae
night, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman
stopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune
out wi' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the
other, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o' our enemies.You that's a sodger will think me but a silly auld
wife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the
pursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some
o' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to
Sisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to
save it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I
wanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that
murdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye'll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell
wi' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the
tother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his
mother's face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,
to my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;
and sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might
help on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale's young blood
to his enemies' sword wad ne'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive
again.""Was it Lord Evandale whose
life you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae
me a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when
he was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and
the estate was sair plea'd between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the
present laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for
love o' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o' the best and
bonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat
the Castle and land, and on the back o' that came the Revolution, and wha
to turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig
a' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion's sake.And then he got
favour, and Lord Evandale's head was under water; for he was ower proud
and manfu' to bend to every blast o' wind, though mony a ane may ken as
weel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill
friend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil
Olifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set
by and ill looked on, and his word ne'er asked; and then Basil, wha's a
revengefu' man, set himsell to vex him in a' shapes, and especially by
oppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that
saved Lord Evandale's life, and that he was sae kind to.But he's mistaen
if that's his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae
me about the selling my kye for rent or e'er it was due, or the putting
the dragoons on me when the country's quiet, or onything else that will
vex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld's loss is the
least part o't."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and
high-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration
upon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of
vengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say
that a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to
return on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him
look to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that
are lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o' them has
been twice up at Tillietudlem.He's a kind of favourite wi' the laird,
though he was in former times ane o' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade
through a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale's safety," said Morton,
"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these
suspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you
indulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell
of Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and
alarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so
alarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked
after by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is
to come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry
has nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the
same with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her
fingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I'll be free
wi' you.But, for God's sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,
I trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party
at Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I
can trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle
almaist frae this Government as e'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But
I am only just now returned from abroad.""I'll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of
listening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting
intelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead
of casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and
turned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there
was not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then
continued,--"I'll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again
the Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish
devices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from
the countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship
of the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange
wad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was
hard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it
may be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld
place o' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair
especially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne'er
forget how he was bending hither of a' nights in the year on that e'ening
after the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off
for that time."exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the
high-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her
narrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming
it with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o' me than that I hae
been willing to save the life o' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only
wished to show you that I know so much of this person's affairs that I
might be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your
narrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though
its tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been
dethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word
of the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged
clergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant
Kirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu'
champions o' the testimony agree e'en waur wi' this than wi' the open
tyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and
deadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi' fizenless
bran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving
creature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that
might warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o' morality driven
about his lugs, and--"

"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old
woman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the
duties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you
are not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of
the same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and
fasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we
are like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and
fought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might
be made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new
bottom, as, after a', when King James went awa, I understand the great
quarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed
prelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi' the
present model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet
our honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and
freedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o' the
Jacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa' to the ground
like a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa
stools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom
of conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the
east, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we
blinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver'se himsell, that they ca' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting
would have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,
"there's sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that
were King James's greatest faes are on his side now.Claver'se spake our
friend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there
was a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi' him;
and now he's anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord
Evandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,
thae starts o' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair
advantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi' John Balfour o' Burley, and
dinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against
the Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,
and the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi'
him, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,
ye ken little o' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae
man can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might
hae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my
puir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to
recollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at
Milnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and
some whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of
Burley's soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which
several circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a
victim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,
not only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might
have discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to
be proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which
it occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or
surrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these
visitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from
the narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,
and the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate
fidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It
was, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men
like Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to
the wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the
world, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and
courage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined
valour.Maclure's information confirmed
Morton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the
gate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of
danger, as he ca's it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of
refuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,
for whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do
without to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person
found refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature
took refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It's a doleful
place, but he loves it abune a' others, because he has sae often been in
safe hiding there; and it's my belief he prefers it to a tapestried
chamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day
syne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to
come o't.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your
rest, for ye maun stir wi' the first dawn o' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the
evening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,
between sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the
riders' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such
painful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found
               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,
               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard
at the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish
treble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn
or the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth
and joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,
through the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,
unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the
whole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing
its windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more
wild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered
the girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the
child."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a
bit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when
we are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and
followed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied
the room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the
guide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted
Morton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him
for the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without
surprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which
conducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of
flat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred
feet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot
over the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but
one sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was
obstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the
waterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured
waters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the
eye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open
course.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a
cavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting
ledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very
nearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the
surrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to
seek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood
beside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the
fall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not
hear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which
the brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,
thought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,
as if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints
with the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,
but tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had
rendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by
notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into
the chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated
not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and
footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,
prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty
feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,
his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a
situation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly
opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about
one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,
and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool
which received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,
namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into
which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole
continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was
eddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon
that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the
incessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce
three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the
chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully
narrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested
on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity
extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,
Morton's eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection
glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling
water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange
preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the
rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though
even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his
sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for
hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his
farther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the
persecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among
dells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary
and secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who
had long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and
others who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called
Creehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never
exactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised
how the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained
concealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural
phenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild
district, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted
preachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence
was carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should
traverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,
and rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the
chasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to
give him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of
the rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,
Morton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye
firm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head
to become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the
foam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and
safely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small
cavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,
proceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the
interior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of
its inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,
being concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no
means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task
which he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a
grisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in
one hand, and his drawn sword in the other.His figure, dimly ruddied by
the light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid
atmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they
could be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a
place of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of
a man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,
urged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I
not tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as
thou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which
render thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of
this book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well
done to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--
Art gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained
standing still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;
"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun's ower the hill; ye may
gang in and speak wi' him now.I'll wait for you at the other side of the
linn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton
presented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first
exclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an
expression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a
demoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,
"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of
Bothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an
idea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that
mastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of
enforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the
scabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old
soldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This
done, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to
his ordinary discourse:--

"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage
before the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the
right hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones
or dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]


"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,
"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my
heart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton's son durst have
followed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of
Nature's own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate
oak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss
below, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving
enemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single
fight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now
have had little need.""What little need, when incarnate
fiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it
matters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place
of refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of
limestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of
Torwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish
fever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I
doubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person
which I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I
can guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of
Lady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that
base, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy
operations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what
you have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that
thy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I
have taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still
hope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich
inheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek
to rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of
the lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For
whose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than
Samson's?""For Lord Evandale's and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are
willing to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and
back a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that
ever sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed
Evandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow
them with wealth and with heritages, and thou think'st that there lives
another man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally
cold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,
and hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none
but Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little
consequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these
estates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,
and strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to
the day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose
wealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive
him of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands
of Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he
called himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he
will become what I list while I have in my power the document that may
deprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in
his nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as
I think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of
bestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a
malignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the
world fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he
will see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such
as he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,
governed by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,
therefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work
in the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I
could understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its
justice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in
keeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful
purpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and
what would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity
which nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon
they are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the
skull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into
Scotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious
villain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at
Drumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain
who defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the
Revolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done
great deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a
deliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,
"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of
Erastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;
to restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust
beside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government
as now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,
excepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you
would not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the
camp of the malignant Claver'se, as the future King of Israel sought the
land of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the
villain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--
I could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping
the horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,
son of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith
Bellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal
equal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil
Olifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document
[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands
of her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee
fight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved
thee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even
to gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of
justice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;
I grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain
by your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be
thought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all
other considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used
for the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the
heap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his
boot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung
forward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and
younger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually
prevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a
cinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,
rendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive
of frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be mine, or die!""I contemn your threats," said Morton; "I pity you, and leave you."But as he turned to retire, Burley stept before him, pushed the oak-trunk
from its resting place, and as it fell thundering and crashing into the
abyss beneath, drew his sword, and cried out, with a voice that rivalled
the roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak, "Now thou
art at bay!and standing in the mouth of the
cavern, he flourished his naked sword."I will not fight with the man that preserved my father's life," said
Morton."I have not yet learned to say the words, 'I yield;' and my life
I will rescue as I best can."So speaking, and ere Balfour was aware of his purpose, he sprung past
him, and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon
share, leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of
the cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side, and stood there
safe and free from his incensed enemy.He immediately ascended the
ravine, and, as he turned, saw Burley stand for an instant aghast with
astonishment, and then, with the frenzy of disappointed rage, rush into
the interior of his cavern.It was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy man's mind had
been so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments
that it had lost its equipoise, and that there was now in his conduct a
shade of lunacy, not the less striking, from the vigour and craft with
which he pursued his wild designs.Morton soon joined his guide, who had
been terrified by the fall of the oak.This he represented as accidental;
and she assured him, in return, that the inhabitant of the cave would
experience no inconvenience from it, being always provided with materials
to construct another bridge.The adventures of the morning were not yet ended.As they approached the
hut, the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her
grandmother groping her way towards them, at a greater distance from her
home than she could have been supposed capable of travelling.said the old woman, when she heard them approach, "gin
e'er ye loved Lord Evandale, help now, or never!God be praised that left
my hearing when he took my poor eyesight!Peggy, hinny, gang saddle the gentleman's horse, and
lead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw, and bide him there."She conducted him to a small window, through which, himself unobserved,
he could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale, and
conversing earnestly together."The more I think of it," said the one, "the less I like it, Inglis;
Evandale was a good officer and the soldier's friend; and though we were
punished for the mutiny at Tillietudlem, yet, by ---, Frank, you must own
we deserved it.""D--n seize me if I forgive him for it, though!"replied the other; "and
I think I can sit in his skirts now.""Why, man, you should forget and forgive.Better take the start with him
along with the rest, and join the ranting Highlanders.We have all eat
King James's bread.""Thou art an ass; the start, as you call it, will never happen,--the
day's put off.Halliday's seen a ghost, or Miss Bellenden's fallen sick
of the pip, or some blasted nonsense or another; the thing will never
keep two days longer, and the first bird that sings out will get the
reward.""That's true too," answered his comrade; "and will this fellow--this
Basil Olifant--pay handsomely?""Like a prince, man," said Inglis."Evandale is the man on earth whom he
hates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were
he once rubbed out of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own.""But shall we have warrants and force enough?""Few people here will stir against my lord, and we may find him with some
of our own fellows at his back.""Thou 'rt a cowardly fool, Dick," returned Inglis; "he is living quietly
down at Fairy Knowe to avoid suspicion.Olifant is a magistrate, and will
have some of his own people that he can trust along with him.There are
us two, and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting Whig fellow,
called Quintin Mackell, that has an old grudge at Evandale.""Well, well, you are my officer, you know," said the private, with true
military conscience, "and if anything is wrong--"

"I'll take the blame," said Inglis."Come, another pot of ale, and let us
to Tillietudlem.--Here, blind Bess!--Why, where the devil has the old hag
crept to?""Delay them as long as you can," whispered Morton, as he thrust his purse
into the hostess's hand; "all depends on gaining time."Then, walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready,
"To Fairy Knowe?Wittenbold, the commandant there, will readily give me the
support of a troop, and procure me the countenance of the civil power.I
must drop a caution as I pass.--Come, Moorkopf," he said, addressing his
horse as he mounted him, "this day must try your breath and speed."Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,
          Though less and less of Emily he saw;
          So, speechless for a little space he lay,
          Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away.The indisposition of Edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on
which she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden
apparition of Morton.Next morning, however, she was reported to be so
much better that Lord Evandale resumed his purpose of leaving Fairy
Knowe.At a late hour in the forenoon Lady Emily entered the apartment of
Edith with a peculiar gravity of manner.Having received and paid the
compliments of the day, she observed it would be a sad one for her,
though it would relieve Miss Bellenden of an encumbrance: "My brother
leaves us today, Miss Bellenden."exclaimed Edith, in surprise; "for his own house, I trust?""I have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey," answered
Lady Emily; "he has little to detain him in this country."exclaimed Edith, "why was I born to become the wreck of
all that is manly and noble!What can be done to stop him from running
headlong on ruin?I will come down instantly.--Say that I implore he will
not depart until I speak with him.""It will be in vain, Miss Bellenden; but I will execute your commission;"
and she left the room as formally as she had entered it, and informed her
brother Miss Bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming
downstairs ere he went away."I suppose," she added pettishly, "the prospect of being speedily
released from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves.""Sister," said Lord Evandale, "you are unjust, if not envious.""Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I should not have dreamt," glancing her
eye at a mirror, "of being thought envious without better cause.But let
us go to the old lady; she is making a feast in the other room which
might have dined all your troop when you had one."Lord Evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour, for he knew it
was in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride.They
found the table covered with refreshments, arranged under the careful
inspection of Lady Margaret."Ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning, my Lord
Evandale, and ye maun e'en partake of a small collation before ye ride,
such as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can
provide in their present circumstances.For my ain part, I like to see
young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or
their affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he
breakfasted at Tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and
fifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to
my health at the same time in a flagon of Rhenish wine, 'Lady Margaret,
ye speak like a Highland oracle.'These were his Majesty's very words;
so that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to
press young folk to partake of their vivers."It may be well supposed that much of the good lady's speech failed Lord
Evandale's ears, which were then employed in listening for the light step
of Edith.His absence of mind on this occasion, however natural, cost him
very dear.While Lady Margaret was playing the kind hostess,--a part she
delighted and excelled in,--she was interrupted by John Gudyill, who, in
the natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a
family, said, "There was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship."Ye speak as if I kept a shop, and was to
come at everybody's whistle.""Yes, he has a name," answered John, "but your leddyship likes ill to
hear't.""It's Calf-Gibbie, my leddy," said John, in a tone rather above the pitch
of decorous respect, on which he occasionally trespassed, confiding in
his merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of
their humble fortunes,--"It's Calf-Gibbie, an your leddyship will hae't,
that keeps Edie Henshaw's kye down yonder at the Brigg-end,--that's him
that was Guse-Gibbie at Tillietudlem, and gaed to the wappinshaw, and
that--"

"Hold your peace, John," said the old lady, rising in dignity; "you are
very insolent to think I wad speak wi' a person like that.Let him tell
his business to you or Mrs."He'll no hear o' that, my leddy; he says them that sent him bade him gie
the thing to your leddyship's ain hand direct, or to Lord Evandale's, he
wots na whilk.But, to say the truth, he's far frae fresh, and he's but
an idiot an he were.""Then turn him out," said Lady Margaret, "and tell him to come back
to-morrow when he is sober.I suppose he comes to crave some benevolence,
as an ancient follower o' the house.""Like eneugh, my leddy, for he's a' in rags, poor creature."Gudyill made another attempt to get at Gibbie's commission, which was
indeed of the last importance, being a few lines from Morton to Lord
Evandale, acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the
practices of Olifant, and exhorting him either to instant flight, or else
to come to Glasgow and surrender himself, where he could assure him of
protection.This billet, hastily written, he intrusted to Gibbie, whom he
saw feeding his herd beside the bridge, and backed with a couple of
dollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to
which it was addressed.But it was decreed that Goose-Gibbie's intermediation, whether as an
emissary or as a man-at-arms, should be unfortunate to the family of
Tillietudlem.He unluckily tarried so long at the ale-house to prove if
his employer's coin was good that, when he appeared at Fairy Knowe, the
little sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale
and brandy; and instead of asking for Lord Evandale, he demanded to speak
with Lady Margaret, whose name was more familiar to his ear.Being
refused admittance to her presence, he staggered away with the letter
undelivered, perversely faithful to Morton's instructions in the only
point in which it would have been well had he departed from them.A few minutes after he was gone, Edith entered the apartment.Lord
Evandale and she met with mutual embarrassment, which Lady Margaret, who
only knew in general that their union had been postponed by her
granddaughter's indisposition, set down to the bashfulness of a bride and
bridegroom, and, to place them at ease, began to talk to Lady Emily on
indifferent topics.At this moment Edith, with a countenance as pale as
death, muttered, rather than whispered, to Lord Evandale a request to
speak with him.He offered his arm, and supported her into the small
ante-room, which, as we have noticed before, opened from the parlour.He
placed her in a chair, and, taking one himself, awaited the opening of
the conversation."I am distressed, my lord," were the first words she was able to
articulate, and those with difficulty; "I scarce know what I would say,
nor how to speak it.""If I have any share in occasioning your uneasiness," said Lord Evandale,
mildly, "you will soon, Edith, be released from it.""You are determined then, my lord," she replied, "to run this desperate
course with desperate men, in spite of your own better reason, in spite
of your friends' entreaties, in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which
yawns before you?""Forgive me, Miss Bellenden; even your solicitude on my account must not
detain me when my honour calls.My horses stand ready saddled, my
servants are prepared, the signal for rising will be given so soon as I
reach Kilsyth.If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting
it.It will be something," he said, taking her hand, "to die deserving
your compassion, since I cannot gain your love."said Edith, in a tone which went to his heart;
"time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much;
my agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity.Oh, do not rush on
death and ruin!remain to be our prop and stay, and hope everything from
time!""It is too late, Edith," answered Lord Evandale; "and I were most
ungenerous could I practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings
towards me.I know you cannot love me; nervous distress, so strong as to
conjure up the appearance of the dead or absent, indicates a predilection
too powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone.But were it
otherwise, the die is now cast."As he spoke thus, Cuddie burst into the room, terror and haste in his
countenance."Oh, my lord, hide yoursell!they hae beset the outlets o'
the house," was his first exclamation."A party of horse, headed by Basil Olifant," answered Cuddie.echoed Edith, in an agony of terror."What right has the
villain to assail me or stop my passage?I will make my way, were he
backed by a regiment; tell Halliday and Hunter to get out the horses.--
And now, farewell, Edith!"He clasped her in his arms, and kissed her
tenderly; then, bursting from his sister, who, with Lady Margaret,
endeavoured to detain him, rushed out and mounted his horse.All was in confusion; the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to
the front windows of the house, from which they could see a small party
of horsemen, of whom two only seemed soldiers.They were on the open
ground before Cuddie's cottage, at the bottom of the descent from the
house, and showed caution in approaching it, as if uncertain of the
strength within.said Edith; "oh, would he but take the
by-road!"But Lord Evandale, determined to face a danger which his high spirit
undervalued, commanded his servants to follow him, and rode composedly
down the avenue.Old Gudyill ran to arm himself, and Cuddie snatched down
a gun which was kept for the protection of the house, and, although on
foot, followed Lord Evandale.It was in vain his wife, who had hurried up
on the alarm, hung by his skirts, threatening him with death by the sword
or halter for meddling with other folk's matters."Hand your peace, ye b----," said Cuddie; "and that's braid Scotch, or I
wotna what is.Is it ither folk's matters to see Lord Evandale murdered
before my face?"But considering on the
way that he composed the whole infantry, as John Gudyill had not
appeared, he took his vantage ground behind the hedge, hammered his
flint, cocked his piece, and, taking a long aim at Laird Basil, as he was
called, stood prompt for action.As soon as Lord Evandale appeared, Olifant's party spread themselves a
little, as if preparing to enclose him.Their leader stood fast,
supported by three men, two of whom were dragoons, the third in dress and
appearance a countryman, all well armed.But the strong figure, stern
features, and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the
most formidable of the party; and whoever had before seen him could have
no difficulty in recognising Balfour of Burley."Follow me," said Lord Evandale to his servants, "and if we are forcibly
opposed, do as I do."He advanced at a hand gallop towards Olifant, and
was in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road, when Olifant
called out, "Shoot the traitor!"and the whole four fired their carabines
upon the unfortunate nobleman.He reeled in the saddle, advanced his
hand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell
from his horse mortally wounded.His servants had presented their
carabines.Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid
fellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot.At the same
instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord
Evandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant's
forehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground.His followers,
astonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather
disposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the
contest, exclaimed, "Down with the Midianites!"At this instant the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard,
and a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow,
appeared on the fatal field.They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch
commandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.A hasty call to surrender, in the name of God and King William, was
obeyed by all except Burley, who turned his horse and attempted to
escape.Several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer, but,
being well mounted, only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him.He turned deliberately twice, and discharging first one of his pistols,
and then the other, rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding
him, and of the other by shooting his horse, and then continued his
flight to Bothwell Bridge, where, for his misfortune, he found the gates
shut and guarded.Turning from thence, he made for a place where the
river seemed passable, and plunged into the stream, the bullets from the
pistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him.Two balls took
effect when he was past the middle of the stream, and he felt himself
dangerously wounded.He reined his horse round in the midst of the river,
and returned towards the bank he had left, waving his hand, as if with
the purpose of intimating that he surrendered.The troopers ceased firing
at him accordingly, and awaited his return, two of them riding a little
way into the river to seize and disarm him.But it presently appeared
that his purpose was revenge, not safety.As he approached the two
soldiers, he collected his remaining strength, and discharged a blow on
the head of one, which tumbled him from his horse.The other dragoon, a
strong, muscular man, had in the mean while laid hands on him.Burley, in
requital, grasped his throat, as a dying tiger seizes his prey, and both,
losing the saddle in the struggle, came headlong into the river, and were
swept down the stream.Their course might be traced by the blood which
bubbled up to the surface.They were twice seen to rise, the Dutchman
striving to swim, and Burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his
desire that both should perish.Their corpses were taken out about a
quarter of a mile down the river.As Balfour's grasp could not have been
unclenched without cutting off his hands, both were thrown into a hasty
grave, still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph.[Gentle reader, I did request of mine honest friend Peter Proudfoot,
     travelling merchant, known to many of this land for his faithful and
     just dealings, as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares, to
     procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage, a copy of
     the Epitaphion alluded to.And, according to his report, which I see
     no ground to discredit, it runneth thus:--

               Here lyes ane saint to prelates surly,
               Being John Balfour, sometime of Burley,
               Who stirred up to vengeance take,
               For Solemn League and Cov'nant's sake,
               Upon the Magus-Moor in Fife,
               Did tak James Sharpe the apostate's life;
               By Dutchman's hands was hacked and shot,
               Then drowned in Clyde near this saam spot.]While the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account, that of
the brave and generous Lord Evandale was also released.Morton had flung
himself from his horse upon perceiving his situation, to render his dying
friend all the aid in his power.He knew him, for he pressed his hand,
and, being unable to speak, intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to
the house.This was done with all the care possible, and he was soon
surrounded by his lamenting friends.But the clamorous grief of Lady
Emily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of Edith.Unconscious even of the presence of Morton, she hung over the dying man;
nor was she aware that Fate, who was removing one faithful lover, had
restored another as if from the grave, until Lord Evandale, taking their
hands in his, pressed them both affectionately, united them together,
raised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them, and sunk back and
expired in the next moment.I had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter, leaving to
the reader's imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take
place after Lord Evandale's death.But as I was aware that precedents are
wanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers
and compilers, I confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma,
when fortunately I was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with Miss
Martha Buskbody, a young lady who has carried on the profession of
mantua-making at Ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood, with great
success, for about forty years.Knowing her taste for narratives of this
description, I requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning
before I waited on her, and enlighten me by the experience which she must
have acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating
libraries, in Ganderscleugh and the two next market-towns.When, with a
palpitating heart, I appeared before her in the evening, I found her much
disposed to be complimentary."I have not been more affected," said she, wiping the glasses of her
spectacles, "by any novel, excepting the 'Tale of Jemmy and Jenny
Jessamy', which is indeed pathos itself; but your plan of omitting a
formal conclusion will never do.You may be as harrowing to our nerves as
you will in the course of your story, but, unless you had the genius
of the author of 'Julia de Roubignd,' never let the end be altogether
overclouded.Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is
quite essential.""Nothing would be more easy for me, madam, than to comply with your
injunctions; for, in truth, the parties in whom you have had the goodness
to be interested, did live long and happily, and begot sons and
daughters.""It is unnecessary, sir," she said, with a slight nod of reprimand, "to
be particular concerning their matrimonial comforts.But what is your
objection to let us have, in a general way, a glimpse of their future
felicity?""Really, madam," said I, "you must be aware that every volume of a
narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a
conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is
necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.Now, as I think the
one is by no means improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar
usually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history,
growing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of
circumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the
author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language."Pattieson," continued the lady; "you have, as I
may say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the
conclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice
who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand.And
if you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the
marriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of
the story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that
you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely.""Well, madam," I replied, "my materials are so ample that I think I can
satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances
indeed.""First, then," said she, "for that is most essential,--Did Lady Margaret
get back her fortune and her castle?""She did, madam, and in the easiest way imaginable, as heir, namely, to
her worthy cousin, Basil Olifant, who died without a will; and thus, by
his death, not only restored, but even augmented, the fortune of her,
whom, during his life, he had pursued with the most inveterate malice.John Gudyill, reinstated in his dignity, was more important than ever;
and Cuddie, with rapturous delight, entered upon the cultivation of the
mains of Tillietudlem, and the occupation of his original cottage.But,
with the shrewd caution of his character, he was never heard to boast of
having fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in
their original habitations.'After a',' he said to Jenny, who was his
only confidant, 'auld Basil Olifant was my leddy's cousin and a grand
gentleman; and though he was acting again the law, as I understand, for
he ne'er showed ony warrant, or required Lord Evandale to surrender, and
though I mind killing him nae mair than I wad do a muircock, yet it's
just as weel to keep a calm sough about it.'He not only did so, but
ingeniously enough countenanced a report that old Gudyill had done the
deed,--which was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler,
who, far different in disposition from Cuddie, was much more inclined to
exaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood.The blind widow was
provided for in the most comfortable manner, as well as the little guide
to the Linn; and--"

"But what is all this to the marriage,--the marriage of the principal
personages?"interrupted Miss Buskbody, impatiently tapping her
snuff-box."The marriage of Morton and Miss Bellenden was delayed for several
months, as both went into deep mourning on account of Lord Evandale's
death."I hope not without Lady Margaret's consent, sir?""I love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their
parents.In a novel the young people may fall in love without their
countenance, because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the
story; but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last.Even old Delville received Cecilia, though the daughter of a man of low
birth.""And even so, madam," replied I, "Lady Margaret was prevailed on to
countenance Morton, although the old Covenanter, his father, stuck sorely
with her for some time.Edith was her only hope, and she wished to see
her happy; Morton, or Melville Morton, as he was more generally called,
stood so high in the reputation of the world, and was in every other
respect such an eligible match, that she put her prejudice aside, and
consoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny, as
was observed to her, she said, by his most sacred Majesty, Charles the
Second of happy memory, when she showed him the portrait of her
grand-father Fergus, third Earl of Torwood, the handsomest man of his
time, and that of Countess Jane, his second lady, who had a hump-back
and only one eye.This was his Majesty's observation, she said, on one
remarkable morning when he deigned to take his _disjune_--"

"Nay," said Miss Buskbody, again interrupting me, "if she brought such
authority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance, there was no
more to be said.--And what became of old Mrs.What's her name, the
housekeeper?""She was perhaps the happiest of the
party; for once a year, and not oftener, Mr.Melville Morton
dined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state, the hangings
being all displayed, the carpet laid down, and the huge brass candlestick
set on the table, stuck round with leaves of laurel.The preparing the
room for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it
came about, and the putting matters to rights occupied old Alison the
other six, so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all
the year round.""Lived to a good old age, drank ale and brandy with guests of all
persuasions, played Whig or Jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers,
and died worth as much money as married Jenny to a cock laird.I hope,
ma'am, you have no other inquiries to make, for really--"

"Goose-Gibbie, sir?"said my persevering friend,--"Goose-Gibbie, whose
ministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the
narrative?""Consider, my dear Miss Buskbody, (I beg pardon for the
familiarity),--but pray consider, even the memory of the renowned
Scheherazade, that Empress of Tale-tellers, could not preserve every
circumstance.I am not quite positive as to the fate of Goose-Gibbie,
but am inclined to think him the same with one Gilbert Dudden, alias
Calf-Gibbie, who was whipped through Hamilton for stealing poultry."Miss Buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender, crossed her right
leg over her knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling.When I observed her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was
studying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and
wished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied
her with any more queries.In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you
my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the
liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.It was mine earnest wish, most courteous Reader, that the "Tales of my
Landlord" should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of
tomes, or volumes.But as I sent some few more manuscript quires,
containing the continuation of these most pleasing narratives, I was
apprised, somewhat unceremoniously, by my publisher that he did not
approve of novels (as he injuriously called these real histories)
extending beyond four volumes, and if I did not agree to the first four
being published separately, he threatened to decline the article.as if the vernacular article of our mother English were
capable of declension.)Whereupon, somewhat moved by his remonstrances,
and more by heavy charges for print and paper, which he stated to have
been already incurred, I have resolved that these four volumes shall be
the heralds or avant-couriers of the Tales which are yet in my
possession, nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured, and the
remainder anxiously demanded, by the unanimous voice of a discerning
public.I rest, esteemed Reader, thine as thou shalt construe me,

she knotted her small white brow in deep thought."I don't know yet," mused Zoie, "BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL
AGGIE--that's ONE SURE thing.""I certainly will tell her," asserted Jimmy, with a wag of his very
round head."Aggie is just the one to get you out of this.""She's just the one to make things worse," said Zoie decidedly.Then
seeing Jimmy's hurt look, she continued apologetically: "Aggie MEANS
all right, but she has an absolute mania for mixing up in other people's
troubles."I never deceived my wife in all my life," declared Jimmy, with an air
of self approval that he was far from feeling."Now, Jimmy," protested Zoie impatiently, "you aren't going to have
moral hydrophobia just when I need your help!""I'm not going to lie to Aggie, if that's what you mean," said Jimmy,
endeavouring not to wriggle under Zoie's disapproving gaze."Then don't," answered Zoie sweetly.Jimmy never feared Zoie more than when she APPEARED to agree with him."Tell her the truth," urged Zoie."I will," declared Jimmy with an emphatic nod."And I'LL DENY IT," concluded Zoie with an impudent toss of her head.exclaimed Jimmy, and he felt himself getting onto his feet."I've already denied it to Alfred," continued Zoie."I told him I'd
never been in that restaurant without him in all my life, that the
waiter had mistaken someone else for me."And again she turned her back
upon Jimmy."But don't you see," protested Jimmy, "this would all be so very much
simpler if you'd just own up to the truth now, before it's too late?""It IS too late," declared Zoie."Alfred wouldn't believe me now,
whatever I told him.He says a woman who lies once lies all the time.He'd think I'd been carrying on with you ALL ALONG."groaned Jimmy as the full realisation of his predicament
thrust itself upon him."We don't DARE tell him now," continued Zoie, elated by the demoralised
state to which she was fast reducing him."For Heaven's sake, don't make
it any worse," she concluded; "it's bad enough as it is.""It certainly is," agreed Jimmy, and he sank dejectedly into his chair."If you DO tell him," threatened Zoie from the opposite side of the
table, "I'll say you ENTICED me into the place."shrieked Jimmy and again he found himself on his feet."I will," insisted Zoie, "I give you fair warning.""I don't believe you've any
conscience at all," he said.And throwing herself
into the nearest armchair she wept copiously at the thought of her many
injuries.Uncertain whether to fly or to remain, Jimmy gazed at her gloomily."Well, I'M not laughing myself to death," he said."I just wish I'd never laid
eyes on you, Jimmy," she cried."If I cared about you," she sobbed, "it wouldn't be so bad; but to
think of losing my Alfred for----" words failed her and she trailed off
weakly,--"for nothing!""Thanks," grunted Jimmy curtly.In spite of himself he was always miffed
by the uncomplimentary way in which she disposed of him.Having finished all she had to say to
him, she was now apparently bent upon indulging herself in a first class
fit of hysterics.There are critical moments in all of our lives when our future happiness
or woe hangs upon our own decision.Jimmy felt intuitively that he was
face to face with such a moment, but which way to turn?Being Jimmy, and soft-hearted in spite of his efforts to
conceal it, he naturally turned the wrong way, in other words, towards
Zoie."Oh, come now," he said awkwardly, as he crossed to the arm of her
chair."This isn't the first time you and Alfred have called it all off," he
reminded her.But apparently he
must have patted Zoie on the shoulder.At any rate, something or other
loosened the flood-gates of her emotion, and before Jimmy could possibly
escape from her vicinity she had wheeled round in her chair, thrown her
arms about him, and buried her tear-stained face against his waist-coat.exclaimed Jimmy, for the third time that morning, as he
glanced nervously toward the door; but Zoie was exclaiming in her own
way and sobbing louder and louder; furthermore she was compelling Jimmy
to listen to an exaggerated account of her many disappointments in her
unreasonable husband.Seeing no possibility of escape, without resorting
to physical violence, Jimmy stood his ground, wondering what to expect
next.CHAPTER V

WITHIN an hour from the time Alfred had entered his office that morning
he was leaving it, in a taxi, with his faithful secretary at his
side, and his important papers in a bag at his feet."Take me to the
Sherwood," he commanded the driver, "and be quick."As they neared Alfred's house, Johnson could feel waves of increasing
anger circling around his perturbed young employer and later when they
alighted from the taxi it was with the greatest difficulty that he could
keep pace with him.Unfortunately for Jimmy, the outer door of the Hardy apartment had been
left ajar, and thus it was that he was suddenly startled from Zoie's
unwelcome embraces by a sharp exclamation.cried Alfred, and he brought his fist down with emphasis on the
centre table at Jimmy's back.Wheeling about, Jimmy beheld his friend face to face with him.Alfred's
lips were pressed tightly together, his eyes flashing fire.It was
apparent that he desired an immediate explanation.Jimmy turned to the
place where Zoie had been, to ask for help; like the traitress that she
was, he now saw her flying through her bedroom door.Again he glanced at
Alfred, who was standing like a sentry, waiting for the pass-word that
should restore his confidence in his friend."I'm afraid I've disturbed you," sneered Alfred."Oh, no, not at all," answered Jimmy, affecting a careless indifference
that he did not feel and unconsciously shaking hands with the waiting
secretary.Reminded of the secretary's presence in such a distinctly family scene,
Alfred turned to him with annoyance.Here's your
list," he added and he thrust a long memorandum into the secretary's
hand.Johnson retired as unobtrusively as possible and the two old
friends were left alone.There was another embarrassed silence which
Jimmy, at least, seemed powerless to break."Tolerably well," answered Jimmy in his most pleasant but slightly
nervous manner.Then followed another pause in which Alfred continued to
eye his old friend with grave suspicion."The fact is," stammered Jimmy, "I just came over to bring Aggie----" he
corrected himself--"that is, to bring Zoie a little message from Aggie.""It seemed to be a SAD one," answered Alfred, with a sarcastic smile, as
he recalled the picture of Zoie weeping upon his friend's sleeve.answered Jimmy, with an elaborate attempt at carelessness."Do you generally play the messenger during business hours?"thundered
Alfred, becoming more and more enraged at Jimmy's petty evasions."Just SOMETIMES," answered Jimmy, persisting in his amiable manner."Jimmy," said Alfred, and there was a solemn warning in his voice,
"don't YOU lie to me!"The consciousness of his guilt was strong
upon him."I beg your pardon," he gasped, for the want of anything more
intelligent to say."You don't do it well," continued Alfred, "and you and I are old
friends."Jimmy's round eyes fixed themselves on the carpet."My wife has been telling you her troubles," surmised Alfred.Jimmy tried to protest, but the lie would not come."Very well," continued Alfred, "I'll tell you something too.He thrust his hands in his pockets and began to walk up and
down."What a turbulent household," thought Jimmy and then he set out in
pursuit of his friend."I'm sorry you've had a misunderstanding," he
began.shouted Alfred, turning upon him so sharply that he
nearly tripped him up, "we've never had anything else.There was never
anything else for us TO have.She's lied up hill and down dale from the
first time she clinched her baby fingers around my hand--" he imitated
Zoie's dainty manner--"and said 'pleased to meet you!'But I've caught
her with the goods this time," he shouted, "and I've just about got
HIM.""The wife-stealer," exclaimed Alfred, and he clinched his fists in
anticipation of the justice he would one day mete out to the despicable
creature.Now Jimmy had been called many things in his time, he realised that he
would doubtless be called many more things in the future, but never by
the wildest stretch of imagination, had he ever conceived of himself in
the role of "wife-stealer."Mistaking Jimmy's look of amazement for one of incredulity, Alfred
endeavoured to convince him."Oh, YOU'LL meet a wife-stealer sooner or later," he assured him."You
needn't look so horrified."Jimmy only stared at him and he continued excitedly: "She's had the
effrontery--the bad taste--the idiocy to lunch in a public restaurant
with the blackguard."The mere sound of the word made Jimmy shudder, but engrossed in his own
troubles Alfred continued without heeding him."Henri, the head-waiter, told me," explained Alfred, and Jimmy
remembered guiltily that he had been very bumptious with the fellow."You know the place," continued Alfred, "the LaSalle--a restaurant where
I am known--where she is known--where my best friends dine--where Henri
has looked after me for years.And again
Alfred paced the floor."Oh, I wouldn't go as far as that," stammered Jimmy.cried Alfred, again turning so abruptly that Jimmy
caught his breath.Each word of Jimmy's was apparently goading him on to
greater anger."Now don't get hasty," Jimmy almost pleaded."The whole thing is no
doubt perfectly innocent.Jimmy feared that his young friend might actually become violent.Alfred
bore down upon him like a maniac."She wouldn't know the truth if she saw
it under a microscope.She's the most unconscionable little liar that
ever lured a man to the altar."Jimmy rolled his round eyes with feigned incredulity."I found it out before we'd been married a month," continued Alfred."She used to sit evenings facing the clock.Invariably she would lie half an hour,
backward or forward, just for practice.Here,
listen to some of these," he added, as he drew half a dozen telegrams
from his inner pocket, and motioned Jimmy to sit at the opposite side of
the table.Jimmy would have preferred to stand, but it was not a propitious time to
consult his own preferences.He allowed himself to be bullied into the
chair that Alfred suggested.Throwing himself into the opposite chair, Alfred selected various
exhibits from his collection of messages."I just brought these up from
the office," he said."These are some of the telegrams that she sent me
each day last week while I was away.And he proceeded
to read with a sneering imitation of Zoie's cloy sweetness."'Darling, so lonesome without you.When are you coming
home to your wee sad wifie?Tearing the
defenceless telegram into bits, Alfred threw it from him and waited for
his friend's verdict."Oh, that's nothing," answered Alfred.And he
selected another from the same pocket.asked Jimmy, feeling more and more convinced that
his own deceptions would certainly be run to earth."I HAVE to spy upon her," answered Alfred, "in self-defence.It's the
only way I can keep her from making me utterly ridiculous."And he
proceeded to read from the secretary's telegram.Lunched at Martingale's with man and woman unknown to
me--Martingale's,'" he repeated with a sneer--"'Motored through Park
with Mrs.Wilmer," he exclaimed, "there's a
woman I've positively forbidden her to speak to."Jimmy only shook his head and Alfred continued to read.Thompson and young Ardesley at the Park
View.'Ardesley is a young cub," explained Alfred, "who spends his time
running around with married women while their husbands are away trying
to make a living for them."was the extent of Jimmy's comment, and Alfred resumed
reading.He looked at Jimmy, expecting to hear Zoie bitterly condemned."That's pretty good," commented Alfred, "for
the woman who 'CRIED' all day, isn't it?"Still Jimmy made no answer, and Alfred brought his fist down upon the
table impatiently."She was a bit busy THAT day," admitted Jimmy uneasily.cried Alfred again, as he rose and paced about excitedly."Getting the truth out of Zoie is like going to a fire in the night.You
think it's near, but you never get there.And when she begins by saying
that she's going to tell you the 'REAL truth'"--he threw up his hands in
despair--"well, then it's time to leave home."CHAPTER VI

There was another pause, then Alfred drew in his breath and bore down
upon Jimmy with fresh vehemence."The only time I get even a semblance
of truth out of Zoie," he cried, "is when I catch her red-handed."Again he pounded the table and again Jimmy winced."And even then," he
continued, "she colours it so with her affected innocence and her plea
about just wishing to be a 'good fellow,' that she almost makes me doubt
my own eyes.She is an artist," he declared with a touch of enforced
admiration."There's no use talking; that woman is an artist."asked Jimmy, for the want of anything better
to say."I am going to leave her," declared Alfred emphatically.A faint hope lit Jimmy's round childlike face.With Alfred away there
would be no further investigation of the luncheon incident."That might be a good idea," he said."It's THE idea," said Alfred; "most of my business is in Detroit anyhow.I'm going to make that my headquarters and stay there.""As for Zoie," continued Alfred, "she can stay right here and go as far
as she likes.""But," shrieked Alfred, with renewed emphasis, "I'm going to find out
who the FELLOW is."Henri knows the head-waiter of every restaurant in this town," said
Alfred, "that is, every one where she'd be likely to go; and he says
he'd recognise the man she lunched with if he saw him again.""The minute she appears anywhere with anybody," explained Alfred, "Henri
will be notified by 'phone.He'll identify the man and then he'll wire
me.""I'll take the first train home," declared Alfred.gasped Jimmy, almost losing his footing.Alfred mistook Jimmy's concern for anxiety on his behalf."Oh, I'll be acquitted," he declared.I'll get my tale
of woe before the jury.""But I say," protested Jimmy, too uneasy to longer conceal his real
emotions, "why kill this one particular chap when there are so many
others?""He's the only one she's ever lunched with, ALONE," said Alfred."She's
been giddy, but at least she's always been chaperoned, except with him.He's the one all right; there's no doubt about it."His own end, yes," assented Jimmy half to himself."Now, see here, old
man," he argued, "I'd give that poor devil a chance to explain."shouted Alfred so sharply that Jimmy quickly retreated."I
wouldn't believe him now if he were one of the Twelve Apostles.""That's tough," murmured Jimmy as he saw the last avenue of honourable
escape closed to him."On the Apostles, I mean," explained Jimmy nervously.Again Alfred paced up and down the room, and again Jimmy tried to think
of some way to escape from his present difficulty.It was quite apparent
that his only hope lay not in his own candor, but in Alfred's absence."How long do you expect to be away?""Only until I hear from Henri," said Alfred.repeated Jimmy and again a gleam of hope shone on his dull
features.He had heard that waiters were often to be bribed."Nice
fellow, Henri," he ventured cautiously."Gets a large salary, no doubt?"exclaimed Alfred, with a certain pride of proprietorship."No
tips could touch Henri, no indeed.Again the hope faded from Jimmy's round face."I look upon Henri as my friend," continued Alfred enthusiastically."He
speaks every language known to man.He's been in every country in the
world."LOTS of people UNDERSTAND LIFE," commented Jimmy dismally, "but SOME
people don't APPRECIATE it.They value it too lightly, to MY way of
thinking.""Ah, but you have something to live for," argued Alfred."I have indeed; a great deal," agreed Jimmy, more and more abused at the
thought of what he was about to lose."Ah, that's different," exclaimed Alfred.Jimmy was in no frame of mind to consider his young friend's assets, he
was thinking of his own difficulties."I'm a laughing stock," shouted Alfred.A 'good thing' who
gives his wife everything she asks for, while she is running around
with--with my best friend, for all I know.""Oh, no, no," protested Jimmy nervously."Even if she weren't running around," continued Alfred excitedly,
without heeding his friend's interruption, "what have we to look forward
to?Alfred answered his own question by lifting his arms tragically toward
Heaven."One eternal round of wrangles and rows!he cried, wheeling about on Jimmy, and
daring him to answer in the affirmative."All she
wants is a good time.""Well," mumbled Jimmy, "I can't see much in babies myself, fat, little,
red worms."Alfred's breath went from him in astonishment

"Weren't YOU ever a fat, little, red worm?""Wasn't _I_
ever a little, fat, red----" he paused in confusion, as his ear became
puzzled by the proper sequence of his adjectives, "a fat, red, little
worm," he stammered; "and see what we are now!"He thrust out his chest
and strutted about in great pride."Big red worms," admitted Jimmy gloomily."You and I ought to have SONS on the way to
what we are," he declared, "and better.""Oh yes, better," agreed Jimmy, thinking of his present plight.Jimmy glanced about the room, as though expecting an answering
demonstration from the ceiling.Out of sheer absent mindedness Jimmy shrugged his shoulders."YOU have
a wife who spends her time and money gadding about with----"

Jimmy's face showed a new alarm.

""I have a wife," said Alfred, "who spends her time and my money gadding
around with God knows whom."Here," he said, pulling a roll of bills from his pocket."I'll bet you
I'll catch him.Undesirous of offering any added inducements toward his own capture,
Jimmy backed away both literally and figuratively from Alfred's
proposition."What's the use of getting so excited?"Mistaking Jimmy's unwillingness to bet for a disinclination to take
advantage of a friend's reckless mood, Alfred resented the implied
insult to his astuteness."Let's see the colour of
your money," he demanded.But before Jimmy could comply, an unexpected voice broke into the
argument and brought them both round with a start.CHAPTER VII

"Good Heavens," exclaimed Aggie, who had entered the room while Alfred
was talking his loudest.Her eyes fell upon Jimmy who was teetering about uneasily just behind
Alfred.Was it possible that Jimmy, the
methodical, had left his office at this hour of the morning, and for
what?Avoiding the question in Aggie's eyes, Jimmy pretended to be searching
for his pocket handkerchief--but always with the vision of Aggie in her
new Fall gown and her large "picture" hat at his elbow.Never before had
she appeared so beautiful to him, so desirable--suppose he should lose
her?Life spread before him as a dreary waste.He tried to look up at
her; he could not.He feared she would read his guilt in his eyes.There was no longer any denying the fact--a
secret had sprung up between them.Annoyed at receiving no greeting, Aggie continued in a rather hurt
voice:

"Aren't you two going to speak to me?"Alfred swallowed hard in an effort to regain his composure."Good-morning," he said curtly.Fully convinced of a disagreement between the two old friends, Aggie
addressed herself in a reproachful tone to Jimmy."My dear," she said, "what are you doing here this time of day?"Jimmy felt Alfred's steely eyes upon him."Why, I
just came over to--bring your message."Alfred's eyebrows drew themselves sharply together.Jimmy had told so many lies this morning that another more or less could
not matter; moreover, this was not a time to hesitate."Why, the message you sent to Zoie," he answered boldly."But I sent no message to Zoie," said Aggie.thundered Alfred, so loud that Aggie's fingers involuntarily
went to her ears.She was more and more puzzled by the odd behaviour of
the two."I mean yesterday's message," corrected Jimmy.And he assumed an
aggrieved air toward Aggie."I told you to 'phone her yesterday
morning from the office.""Yes, I know," agreed Jimmy placidly, "but I forgot it and I just came
over to explain."Alfred's fixed stare was relaxing and at last Jimmy
could breathe."Oh," murmured Aggie, with a wise little elevation of her eye-brows,
"then that's why Zoie didn't keep her luncheon appointment with me
yesterday."Jimmy felt that if this were to go on much longer, he would utter one
wild shriek and give himself up for lost; but at present he merely
swallowed with an effort, and awaited developments.It was now Alfred's turn to become excited.Was this her usually
self-controlled friend?sneered Alfred with unmistakable pity for her credulity."That's not why my wife didn't eat luncheon with you.She may TELL you
that's why.She undoubtedly will; but it's NOT why.and running
his hands through his hair, Alfred tore up and down the room."Your dear husband Jimmy will doubtless explain," answered Alfred with
a slur on the "dear."Then he turned toward the door of his study."Pray
excuse me--I'M TOO BUSY," and with that he strode out of the room and
banged the study door behind him.She looked after Alfred, then at
Jimmy."Just another little family tiff," answered Jimmy, trying to assume a
nonchalant manner."That just shows how silly one can
be.I almost thought Alfred was going to say that Zoie had lunched with
you."again echoed Jimmy, and he wondered if everybody in the world had
conspired to make him the target of their attention.He caught Aggie's
eye and tried to laugh carelessly."That would have been funny, wouldn't
it?""Yes, wouldn't it," repeated Aggie, and he thought he detected a slight
uneasiness in her voice."Speaking of lunch," added Jimmy quickly, "I think, dearie, that I'll
come home for lunch in the future.""Those downtown places upset my digestion," explained Jimmy quickly."Isn't this very SUDDEN," she asked, and again Jimmy fancied that there
was a shade of suspicion in her tone."Of course, dear," he said, "if
you insist upon my eating downtown, I'll do it; but I thought you'd be
glad to have me at home.""Why, Jimmy," she said, "what's
the matter with you?"She took a step toward him and anxiously studied
his face."I never heard you talk like that before."That's just what I'm telling you," insisted Jimmy vehemently, excited
beyond all reason by receiving even this small bit of sympathy.No sooner had he made the declaration than he began
to believe in it.His doleful countenance increased Aggie's alarm."My angel-face," she purred, and she took his chubby cheeks in her
hands and looked down at him fondly."You know I ALWAYS want you to come
home."She stooped and kissed Jimmy's pouting lips.She smoothed the hair from his worried brow and endeavoured
to cheer him."I'll run right home now," she said, "and tell cook to get
something nice and tempting for you!"It doesn't matter," murmured Jimmy, as he followed her toward the door
with a doleful shake of his head."I don't suppose I shall ever enjoy my
luncheon again--as long as I live.""Nonsense," cried Aggie, "come along."CHAPTER VIII

WHEN Alfred returned to the living room he was followed by his
secretary, who carried two well-filled satchels.His temper was not
improved by the discovery that he had left certain important papers
at his office.Dispatching his man to get them and to meet him at the
station with them, he collected a few remaining letters from the drawer
of the writing table, then uneasy at remaining longer under the same
roof with Zoie, he picked up his hat, and started toward the hallway.For the first time his eye was attracted by a thick layer of dust and
lint on his coat sleeve.Worse still, there was a smudge on his cuff.If there was one thing more than another that Alfred detested it was
untidiness.Putting his hat down with a bang, he tried to flick the dust
from his sleeve with his pocket handkerchief; finding this impossible,
he removed his coat and began to shake it violently.It was at this particular moment that Zoie's small face appeared
cautiously from behind the frame of the bedroom door.She was quick to
perceive Alfred's plight.Disappearing from view for an instant, she
soon reappeared with Alfred's favourite clothes-brush.She tiptoed into
the room.Barely had Alfred drawn his coat on his shoulders, when he was startled
by a quick little flutter of the brush on his sleeve.He turned
in surprise and beheld Zoie, who looked up at him as penitent and
irresistible as a newly-punished child."Oh," snarled Alfred, and he glared at her as though he would enjoy
strangling her on the spot."Alfred," pouted Zoie, and he knew she was going to add her customary
appeal of "Let's make up."He
thrust his hands in his pockets and made straight for the outer doorway.Smiling to herself as she saw him leaving without his hat, Zoie slipped
it quickly beneath a flounce of her skirt.No sooner had Alfred reached
the sill of the door than his hand went involuntarily to his head; he
turned to the table where he had left his hat.He glanced beneath the table, in the chair, behind the table,
across the piano, and then he began circling the room with pent up rage.He dashed into his study and out again, he threw the chairs about with
increasing irritation, then giving up the search, he started hatless
toward the hallway.It was then that a soft babyish voice reached his
ear.It was difficult to lower his dignity by answering
her, but he needed his headgear."I want my hat," he admitted shortly.repeated Zoie innocently and she glanced around the room
with mild interest.cried Alfred, and thinking the mystery solved, he dashed toward
the inner hallway."Let ME get it, dear," pleaded Zoie, and she laid a small detaining hand
upon his arm as he passed.commanded Alfred hotly, and he shook the small hand from his
sleeve as though it had been something poisonous."But Allie," protested Zoie, pretending to be shocked and grieved."Don't you 'but Allie' me," cried Alfred, turning upon her sharply."All
I want is my hat," and again he started in search of Mary."But--but--but Allie," stammered Zoie, as she followed him."But--but--but," repeated Alfred, turning on her in a fury."You've
butted me out of everything that I wanted all my life, but you're not
going to do it again.""You see, you said it yourself," laughed Zoie.The remnants of Alfred's self-control were forsaking him.He clinched
his fists hard in a final effort toward restraint."You'd just as well
stop all these baby tricks," he threatened between his teeth, "they're
not going to work."Then why are you afraid to talk to me?""You ACT like it," declared Zoie, with some truth on her side."You
don't want----" she got no further."All I want," interrupted Alfred, "is to get out of this house once and
for all and to stay out of it."And again he started in pursuit of his
hat."Why, Allie," she gazed at him with deep reproach."You liked this place
so much when we first came here."Again Alfred picked at the lint on his coat sleeve.Edging her way
toward him cautiously she ventured to touch his sleeve with the brush."I'll attend to that myself," he said curtly, and he sank into the
nearest chair to tie a refractory shoe lace."Let me brush you, dear," pleaded Zoie."I don't wish you to start out
in the world looking unbrushed," she pouted.Then with a sly emphasis
she added teasingly, "The OTHER women might not admire you that way."Alfred broke his shoe string then and there.While he stooped to tie a
knot in it, Zoie managed to perch on the arm of his chair."You know, Allie," she continued coaxingly, "no one could ever love you
as I do."she exclaimed with a little ripple of childish laughter,
"do you remember how absurdly poor we were when we were first married,
and how you refused to take any help from your family?And do you
remember that silly old pair of black trousers that used to get so thin
on the knees and how I used to put shoe-blacking underneath so the white
wouldn't show through?"By this time her arm managed to get around his
neck.shrieked Alfred as though mortal man could endure no more."You've used those trousers to settle every crisis in our lives."Zoie gazed at him without daring to breathe; even she was aghast at his
fury, but only temporarily.She recovered herself and continued sweetly:

"If everything is SETTLED," she argued, "where's the harm in talking?""We've DONE with talking," declared Alfred.And determined not to be cheated out of this final decision, he again
started for the hall door.cried Zoie in a tone of sharp alarm.In spite of himself Alfred turned to learn the cause of her anxiety."You haven't got your overshoes on," she said.Speechless with rage, Alfred continued on his way, but Zoie moved before
him swiftly."I'll get them for you, dear," she volunteered graciously."I wish you wouldn't roar like that," pouted Zoie, and the pink tips of
her fingers were thrust tight against her ears.Alfred drew in his breath and endeavoured for the last time to repress
his indignation."Either you can't, or you won't understand that it is
extremely unpleasant for me to even talk to you--much less to receive
your attentions.""Very likely," answered Zoie, unperturbed."But so long as I am your
lawful wedded wife----" she emphasised the "lawful"--"I shan't let any
harm come to you, if _I_ can help it."She lifted her eyes to heaven
bidding it to bear witness to her martyrdom and looking for all the
world like a stained glass saint.shouted Alfred, almost hysterical at his apparent failure to
make himself understood."You wouldn't let any harm come to me.You've only made me the greatest joke in Chicago," he shouted."You've
only made me such a laughing stock that I have to leave it.Then regaining her
self-composure, she edged her way close to him and looked up into his
eyes in baby-like wonderment."Why, Allie, where are we going?"Her
small arm crept up toward his shoulder.Alfred pushed it from him
rudely."WE are not going," he asserted in a firm, measured voice.And again he started in search of his absent
headgear.she exclaimed, and this time there was genuine alarm in her
voice, "you wouldn't leave me?"Before he knew it, Zoie's arms
were about him--she was pleading desperately."Now see here, Allie, you may call me all the names you like," she cried
with great self-abasement, "but you shan't--you SHAN'T go away from
Chicago."answered Alfred as he shook himself free of her."I
suppose you'd like me to go on with this cat and dog existence.You'd
like me to stay right here and pay the bills and take care of you, while
you flirt with every Tom, Dick and Harry in town.""It's only your horrid disposition that makes you talk like that,"
whimpered Zoie."You know very well that I never cared for anybody but
you.""Until you GOT me, yes," assented Alfred, "and NOW you care for
everybody BUT me."She was about to object, but he continued quickly."Where you MEET your gentlemen friends is beyond me._I_ don't introduce
them to you.""I should say not," agreed Zoie, and there was a touch of vindictiveness
in her voice."The only male creature that you ever introduced to me was
the family dog.""I introduce every man who's fit to meet you," declared Alfred with an
air of great pride."That doesn't speak very well for your acquaintances," snipped Zoie."I won't bicker like this," declared Alfred."That's what you always say, when you can't think of an answer,"
retorted Zoie."You mean when I'm tired of answering your nonsense!"CHAPTER IX

Realising that she was rapidly losing ground by exercising her advantage
over Alfred in the matter of quick retort, Zoie, with her customary
cunning, veered round to a more conciliatory tone."Well," she cooed,
"suppose I DID eat lunch with a man?"shrieked Alfred, as though he had at last run his victim to earth."I only said suppose," she
reminded him quickly.Then she continued in a tone meant to draw from
him his heart's most secret confidence."Didn't you ever eat lunch with
any woman but me?"There was an unmistakable expression of pleasure on Zoie's small face,
but she forced back the smile that was trying to creep round her lips,
and sidled toward Alfred, with eyes properly downcast."Then I'm very
sorry I did it," she said solemnly, "and I'll never do it again.""Just to please you, dear," explained Zoie sweetly, as though she were
doing him the greatest possible favour."Do you suppose it pleases me to know
that you are carrying on the moment my back is turned, making a fool of
me to my friends?"This time it was her turn to be
angry.It's your FRIENDS that are worrying you!"In her excitement
she tossed Alfred's now damaged hat into the chair just behind her.He
was far too overwrought to see it."_I_ haven't done you any harm," she
continued wildly."It's only what you think your friends think."repeated Alfred, in her same tragic key,
"Oh no!You've only cheated me out of everything I expected to
get out of life!Zoie came to a full stop and waited for him to enumerate the various
treasures that he had lost by marrying her."Before we were married," he continued, "you pretended to adore
children.You started your humbugging the first day I met you.Alfred continued:

"I was fool enough to let you know that I admire women who like
children.From that day until the hour that I led you to the altar,
you'd fondle the ugliest little brats that we met in the street, but the
moment you GOT me----"

"Alfred!"shouted Alfred, pounding the table with his fist for
emphasis."The moment you GOT me, you declared that all children were
horrid little insects, and that someone ought to sprinkle bug-powder on
them."protested Zoie, shocked less by Alfred's interpretation of her
sentiments, than by the vulgarity with which he expressed them."On another occasion," declared Alfred, now carried away by the recital
of his long pent up wrongs, "you told me that all babies should be put
in cages, shipped West, and kept in pens until they got to be of an
interesting age.he repeated with a sneer, "meaning
old enough to take YOU out to luncheon, I suppose.""I never said any such thing," objected Zoie."Well, that was the idea," insisted Alfred."I haven't your glib way of
expressing myself.""You manage to express yourself very well," retorted Zoie."When
you have anything DISAGREEABLE to say.As for babies," she continued
tentatively, "I think they are all very well in their PLACE, but they
were NEVER meant for an APARTMENT.""I offered you a house in the country," shouted Alfred."How could I live in the country, with
people being murdered in their beds every night?"Always an excuse," sighed Alfred resignedly."There always HAS been
and there always would be if I'd stay to listen.Well, for once," he
declared, "I'm glad that we have no children.If we had, I might feel
some obligation to keep up this farce of a marriage.As it is," he
continued, "YOU are free and _I_ am free."And with a courtly wave of
his arm, he dismissed Zoie and the entire subject, and again he started
in pursuit of Mary and his hat."If it's your freedom you wish," pouted Zoie with an abused air, "you
might have said so in the first place."Alfred stopped in sheer amazement at the cleverness with which the
little minx turned his every statement against him."It's not very manly of you," she continued, "to abuse me just because
you've found someone whom you like better.""That's not true," protested Alfred hotly, "and you know it's not true."Little did he suspect the trap into which she was leading him."Then you DON'T love anybody more than you do me?"she cried eagerly,
and she gazed up at him with adoring eyes."I didn't say any such thing," hedged Alfred."I DON'T," he declared in self defence.With a cry of joy, she sprang into his arms, clasped her fingers tightly
behind his neck, and rained impulsive kisses upon his unsuspecting face.For an instant, Alfred looked down at Zoie, undecided whether to
strangle her or to return her embraces.As usual, his self-respect won
the day for him and, with a determined effort, he lifted her high in the
air, so that she lost her tenacious hold of him, and sat her down with
a thud in the very same chair in which she had lately dropped his hat.Having acted with this admirable resolution, he strode majestically
toward the inner hall, but before he could reach it, Zoie was again
on her feet, in a last vain effort to conciliate him.Turning, Alfred
caught sight of his poor battered hat.Snatching it up with one hand, and throwing his latchkey on the
table with the other, he made determinedly for the outer door.Screaming hysterically, Zoie caught him just as he reached the threshold
and threw the whole weight of her body upon him."Alfred," she pleaded, "if you REALLY love me, you CAN'T leave me like
this!"He looked down at her gravely--then
into the future."There are other things more important than what YOU call 'love,'" he
said, very solemnly."There is such a thing as a soul, if you only knew it.And you have hurt
mine through and through."asked the small person, and there was a frown of
genuine perplexity on her tiny puckered brow."What have I REALLY DONE,"
She stroked his hand fondly; her baby eyes searched his face."It isn't so much what people DO to us that counts," answered Alfred in
a proud hurt voice."It's how much they DISAPPOINT us in what they do.I
expected better of YOU," he said sadly."I'll DO better," coaxed Zoie, "if you'll only give me a chance.""Now, Allie," she pleaded, perceiving that his resentment was dying and
resolved to, at last, adopt a straight course, "if you'll only listen,
I'll tell you the REAL TRUTH."Unprepared for the electrical effect of her remark, Zoie found herself
staggering to keep her feet.His arms
were lifted to Heaven, his breath was coming fast.he gasped, then bringing his crushed hat down on his
forehead with a resounding whack, he rushed from her sight.The clang of the closing elevator door brought Zoie to a realisation of
what had actually happened.Determined that Alfred should not escape
her she rushed to the hall door and called to him wildly.Running back to the room, she threw open the window and threw
herself half out of it.She was just in time to see Alfred climb into
a passing taxi.Then automatically she flew to the
'phone."Give me 4302 Main," she called and she tried to force back her
tears."I wish you'd ring me up the moment my husband comes in."There was a
slight pause, then she clutched the receiver harder.She
let the receiver fall back on the hook and her head went forward on her
outstretched arms.CHAPTER X

When Jimmy came home to luncheon that day, Aggie succeeded in getting a
general idea of the state of affairs in the Hardy household.Of course
Jimmy didn't tell the whole truth.In fact, he
appeared to be aggravatingly ignorant as to the exact cause of the Hardy
upheaval.Of ONE thing, however, he was certain."Alfred was going to
quit Chicago and leave Zoie to her own devices."and before Jimmy was fairly out of
the front gate, she had seized her hat and gloves and rushed to the
rescue of her friend.Not surprised at finding Zoie in a state of collapse, Aggie opened her
arms sympathetically to receive the weeping confidences that she was
sure would soon come."Zoie dear," she said as the fragile mite rocked to and fro.She pressed the soft ringlets from the girl's throbbing forehead."It's Alfred," sobbed Zoie."Yes, I know," answered Aggie tenderly.questioned Zoie, and she lifted her head and
regarded Aggie with sudden uneasiness.Her friend's answer raised Jimmy
considerably in Zoie's esteem.Apparently he had not breathed a word
about the luncheon."Why, Jimmy told me," continued Aggie, "that you and Alfred had had
another tiff, and that Alfred had gone for good."echoed Zoie and her eyes were wide with terror.cried Zoie, at last fully convinced of the strength
of Alfred's resolve."But he shan't," she declared emphatically.He has no right----" By this time she
was running aimlessly about the room.asked Aggie, feeling sure that Zoie was as
usual at fault."Nothing," answered Zoie with wide innocent eyes.echoed Aggie, with little confidence in her friend's ability
to judge impartially about so personal a matter.And there was no doubting that she
at least believed it."What does he SAY," questioned Aggie diplomatically."He SAYS I 'hurt his soul.'Whatever THAT is," answered Zoie, and
her face wore an injured expression."Isn't that a nice excuse," she
continued, "for leaving your lawful wedded wife?"It was apparent that
she expected Aggie to rally strongly to her defence.But at present
Aggie was bent upon getting facts."I ate lunch," said Zoie with the face of a cherub.She was beginning to scent the
probable origin of the misunderstanding."It's of no consequence," answered Zoie carelessly; "I wouldn't have
wiped my feet on the man."By this time she had entirely forgotten
Aggie's proprietorship in the source of her trouble.urged Aggie, and in her mind, she had already
condemned him as a low, unprincipled creature."It's ANY man with
Alfred--you know that--ANY man!"Aggie sank in a chair and looked at her friend in despair."Why DO you
do these things," she said wearily, "when you know how Alfred feels
about them?""You talk as though I did nothing else," answered Zoie with an aggrieved
tone."It's the first time since I've been married that I've ever eaten
lunch with any man but Alfred.I thought you'd have a little sympathy
with me," she whimpered, "instead of putting me on the gridiron like
everyone else does.""HE'S 'everyone else' to me."And then
with a sudden abandonment of grief, she threw herself prostrate at her
friend's knees."Oh, Aggie, what can I do?"But Aggie was not satisfied with Zoie's fragmentary account of her
latest escapade."Is that the only thing that Alfred has against you?""That's the LATEST," sniffled Zoie, in a heap at Aggie's feet.And then
she continued in a much aggrieved tone, "You know he's ALWAYS rowing
because we haven't as many babies as the cook has cats.""Well, why don't you get him a baby?"asked the practical, far-seeing
Aggie."It's too late NOW," moaned Zoie."It's the very thing that would bring him
back."questioned Zoie, and she looked up at Aggie with
round astonished eyes."Adopt it," answered Aggie decisively.Zoie regarded her friend with mingled disgust and disappointment."No,"
she said with a sigh and a shake of her head, "that wouldn't do any
good."He needn't know," declared Aggie boldly.Drawing herself up with an air of great importance, and regarding the
wondering young person at her knee with smiling condescension, Aggie
prepared to make a most interesting disclosure."There was a long article in the paper only this morning," she told
Zoie, "saying that three thousand husbands in this VERY CITY are
fondling babies not their own."Zoie turned her small head to one side, the better to study Aggie's
face.It was apparent to the latter that she must be much more explicit."Babies adopted in their absence," explained Aggie, "while they were on
trips around the country."A dangerous light began to glitter in Zoie's eyes.she cried, bringing her small hands together excitedly, "do you
think I COULD?"asked Aggie, with a very superior air.Zoie's enthusiasm was
increasing her friend's admiration of her own scheme."This same paper
tells of a woman who adopted three sons while her husband was in Europe,
and he thinks each one of them is his."cried Zoie, now thoroughly enamoured of the
idea."You can always get TONS of them at the Children's Home," answered Aggie
confidently."I can't endure babies," declared Zoie, "but I'd do ANYTHING to get
Alfred back.Aggie looked at her small friend with positive pity."You don't WANT one
TO-DAY," she explained.Zoie rolled her large eyes inquiringly."If you were to get one to-day," continued Aggie, "Alfred would know it
wasn't yours, wouldn't he?"A light of understanding began to show on Zoie's small features."There was none when he left this morning," added Aggie."That's true," acquiesced Zoie."You must wait awhile," counselled Aggie, "and then get a perfectly new
one."But Zoie had never been taught to wait."After a few months," she explained, "when Alfred's temper has had time
to cool, we'll get Jimmy to send him a wire that he has an heir."exclaimed Zoie, as though Aggie had suggested an
eternity."I've never been away from Alfred that long in all my life.""Well, of course," she said coldly, as she
rose to go, "if you can get Alfred back WITHOUT that----"

"But I can't!"cried Zoie, and she clung to her friend as to her last
remaining hope."Then," answered Aggie, somewhat mollified by Zoie's complete
submission.The President of the Children's Home
is a great friend of Jimmy's," she said proudly.It was at this point that Zoie made her first practical suggestion."Then we'll LET JIMMY GET IT," she declared."Of course," agreed Aggie enthusiastically, as though they would be
according the poor soul a rare privilege."Jimmy gives a hundred
dollars to the Home every Christmas,"--additional proof why he should be
selected for this very important office."If Alfred were to
give a hundred dollars to a Baby's Home, I should suspect him."In spite of her firm faith in
Jimmy's innocence, she was undoubtedly annoyed by Zoie's unpleasant
suggestion.There was an instant's pause, then putting disagreeable thoughts from
her mind, Aggie turned to Zoie with renewed enthusiasm."We must get down to business," she said, "we'll begin on the baby's
outfit at once."exclaimed Zoie, and she clapped her hands merrily like a
very small child.A moment later she stopped with sudden misgiving."But, Aggie," she said fearfully, "suppose Alfred shouldn't come back
after I've got the baby?"Oh, he's sure to come back!""He'll take the first train, home.""I believe he will," assented Zoie joyfully."Aggie," she cried impulsively, "you are a darling.And she clasped her arms so tightly around Aggie's
neck that her friend was in danger of being suffocated.Releasing herself Aggie continued with a ruffled collar and raised
vanity: "You can write him an insinuating letter now and then, just to
lead up to the good news gradually."Zoie tipped her small head to one side and studied her friend
thoughtfully."Do you know, Aggie," she said, with frank admiration, "I
believe you are a better liar than I am.""I'm NOT a liar," objected Aggie vehemently, "at least, not often," she
corrected."I've never lied to Jimmy in all my life.""And Jimmy has NEVER LIED TO ME.""Isn't that nice," sniffed Zoie and she pretended to be searching for
her pocket-handkerchief."But, Aggie----" protested Zoie, unwilling to be left alone."I'll run in again at tea time," promised Aggie."I don't mind the DAYS," whined Zoie, "but when NIGHT comes I just MUST
have somebody's arms around me."gasped Aggie, both shocked and alarmed."I can't help it," confessed Zoie; "the moment it gets dark I'm just
scared stiff.""That's no way for a MOTHER to talk," reproved Aggie.exclaimed Zoie, horrified at the sudden realisation that
this awful appellation would undoubtedly pursue her for the rest of
her life."Oh, don't call me that," she pleaded."You make me feel a
thousand years old.""Nonsense," laughed Aggie, and before Zoie could again detain her she
was out of the room.When the outside door had closed behind her friend, Zoie gazed about
the room disconsolately, but her depression was short-lived.Remembering
Aggie's permission about the letter, she ran quickly to the writing
table, curled her small self up on one foot, placed a brand new pen in
the holder, then drew a sheet of paper toward her and, with shoulders
hunched high and her face close to the paper after the manner of a
child, she began to pen the first of a series of veiled communications
that were ultimately to fill her young husband with amazement.CHAPTER XI

When Jimmy reached his office after his unforeseen call upon Zoie, his
subsequent encounter with Alfred, and his enforced luncheon at home
with Aggie, he found his mail, his 'phone calls, and his neglected
appointments in a state of hopeless congestion, and try as he would, he
could not concentrate upon their disentanglement.Growing more and more
furious with the long legged secretary who stood at the corner of his
desk, looking down upon him expectantly, and waiting for his tardy
instructions, Jimmy rose and looked out of the window.He could feel
Andrew's reproachful eyes following him."Shall Miss Perkins take your letters now?"asked Andrew, and he
wondered how late the office staff would be kept to-night to make up for
the time that was now being wasted.Coming after repeated wounds from his nearest and dearest, Andrew's
implied reproach was too much for Jimmy's overwrought nerves.And when Andrew could assure himself that
he had heard aright, he stalked out of the door with his head high in
the air.Jimmy looked after his departing secretary with positive hatred.It was
apparent to him that the whole world was against him.His family, friends, and business associates
had undoubtedly lost all respect for him.From this day forth he was
determined to show himself to be a man of strong mettle.Having made this important decision and having convinced himself that he
was about to start on a new life, Jimmy strode to the door of the office
and, without disturbing the injured Andrew, he called sharply to Miss
Perkins to come at once and take his letters.Again he tried in vain to concentrate upon the details of
the "cut-glass" industry.Invariably his mind would wander back to the
unexpected incidents of the morning.Stopping suddenly in the middle of
a letter to a competing firm, he began pacing hurriedly up and down the
room.Had she not feared that her chief might misconstrue any suggestion from
her as an act of impertinence, Miss Perkins, having learned all the
company's cut-glass quotations by rote, could easily have supplied the
remainder of the letter.As it was, she waited impatiently, tapping the
corner of the desk with her idle pencil.Jimmy turned at the sound, and
glanced at the pencil with unmistakable disapproval.After one or two more uneasy laps about the room, Jimmy went
to his 'phone and called his house number."It's undoubtedly domestic trouble," decided Miss Perkins, and she
wondered whether it would be delicate of her, under the circumstances,
to remain in the room.From her employer's conversation at the 'phone, it was clear to Miss
Perkins that Mrs.Jinks was spending the afternoon with Mrs Hardy,
but why this should have so annoyed MR.Jinks was a question that Miss
Perkins found it difficult to answer.Jinks's
present state of unrest could be traced to the door of the beautiful
young wife of his friend?"Oh dear," thought Miss Perkins, "how
scandalous!""That will do," commanded Jimmy, interrupting Miss Perkins's interesting
speculations, and he nodded toward the door."But----" stammered Miss Perkins, as she glanced at the unfinished
letters."I'll call you when I need you," answered Jimmy gruffly.Miss Perkins
left the room in high dudgeon."I'LL show them," said Jimmy to himself, determined to carry out his
recent resolve to be firm.Then his mind wend back to his domestic troubles."Suppose, that Zoie,
after imposing secrecy upon him, should change that thing called her
'mind' and confide in Aggie about the luncheon?"He decided to telephone to Zoie's house and find out how affairs
were progressing."If Aggie HAS found out
about the luncheon," he argued, "my 'phoning to Zoie's will increase her
suspicions.If Zoie has told her nothing, she'll wonder why I'm 'phoning
to Zoie's house.There's only one thing to do," he decided.I can tell from Aggie's face when I meet her at dinner
whether Zoie has betrayed me."Having arrived at this conclusion, Jimmy resolved to get home as early
as possible, and again Miss Perkins was called to his aid.The flurry with which Jimmy despatched the day's remaining business
confirmed both Miss Perkins and Andrew in their previous opinion that
"the boss" had suddenly "gone off his head."And when he at last left
the office and banged the door behind him there was a general sigh of
relief from his usually tranquil staff.Instead of walking, as was his custom, Jimmy took a taxi to his home but
alas, to his surprise he found no wife."None at all," answered that unperturbed creature; and Jimmy felt sure
that the attitude of his office antagonists had communicated itself to
his household servants.When Jimmy's anxious ear at last caught the rustle of a woman's dress in
the hallway, his dinner had been waiting half an hour, and he had
worked himself into a state of fierce antagonism toward everything and
everybody.At the sound of Aggie's voice however, his heart began to pound with
fear."Had she found him out for the weak miserable deceiver that he
was?Would she tell him that they were going to separate forever?""Awfully sorry to be so late,
dear," she said.Jimmy felt her kiss upon his chubby cheek and her dear arms about his
neck.He decided forthwith to tell her everything, and never, never
again to run the risk of deceiving her; but before he could open his
lips, she continued gaily:

"I've brought Zoie home with me, dear.There's no sense in her eating
all alone, and she's going to have ALL her dinners with us.""After dinner," continued Aggie, "you and I can take her to
the theatre and all those places and keep her cheered until Alfred comes
home."Was it possible that Alfred had already
relented?"Oh, he doesn't know it yet," explained Aggie, "but he's coming.We'll
tell you all about it at dinner."While waiting for Aggie, Jimmy had thought himself hungry, but once
the two women had laid before him their "nefarious baby-snatching
scheme"--food lost its savour for him, and one course after another was
taken away from him untouched.Each time that Jimmy ventured a mild objection to his part in the plan,
as scheduled by them, he met the threatening eye of Zoie; and by the
time that the three left the table he was so harassed and confused by
the chatter of the two excited women, that he was not only reconciled
but eager to enter into any scheme that might bring Alfred back, and
free him of the enforced companionship of Alfred's nerve-racking wife.True, he reflected, it was possible that Alfred, on his return, might
discover him to be the culprit who lunched with Zoie and might carry out
his murderous threat; but even such a fate was certainly preferable to
interminable evenings spent under the same roof with Zoie."All YOU need do, Jimmy," explained Aggie sweetly, when the three of
them were comfortably settled in the library, "is to see your friend
the Superintendent of the Babies' Home, and tell him just what kind of a
baby we shall need, and when we shall need it.""Oh yes, indeed," said Aggie confidently, and she turned to Jimmy with
a matter-of-fact tone."You'd better tell the Superintendent to have
several for us to look at when the time arrives.""Yes, that's better," agreed Zoie.As for Jimmy, he had long ceased to make any audible comment, but
internally he was saying to himself: "man of strong mettle, indeed!""We'll attend to all the clothes for the child," said Aggie generously
to Jimmy."I want everything to be hand-made," exclaimed Zoie enthusiastically."We can make a great many of the things ourselves, evenings," said
Aggie, "while we sit here and talk to Jimmy."Jimmy rolled his eyes toward her like a dumb beast of burden."MOST evenings," assented Aggie."And then toward the last, you know,
Zoie----" she hesitated to explain further, for Jimmy was already
becoming visibly embarrassed."Oh, yes, that's true," blushed Zoie.There was an awkward pause, then Aggie turned again toward Jimmy, who
was pretending to rebuild the fire."Oh yes, one more thing," she said."When everything is quite ready for Alfred's return, we'll allow you,
Jimmy dear, to wire him the good news.""I wish it were time to wire now," said Zoie pensively, and in his mind,
Jimmy fervently agreed with that sentiment."The next few months will slip by before you know it," declared Aggie
cheerfully."And by the way, Zoie," she added, "why should you go back
to your lonesome flat to-night?"Zoie began to feel for her pocket handkerchief--Jimmy sat up to receive
the next blow."Stay here with us," suggested Aggie."We'll be so glad
to have you."When the two girls went upstairs arm in arm that night, Jimmy remained
in his chair by the fire, too exhausted to even prepare for bed.This had certainly been the longest day of his life.CHAPTER XII

WHEN Aggie predicted that the few months of waiting would pass quickly
for Zoie, she was quite correct.They passed quickly for Aggie as well;
but how about Jimmy?When he afterward recalled this interval in his
life, it was always associated with long strands of lace winding around
the legs of the library chairs, white things lying about in all the
places where he had once enjoyed sitting or lying, late dinners, lonely
breakfasts, and a sense of isolation from Aggie.One evening when he had waited until he was out of all patience with
Aggie, he was told by his late and apologetical spouse that she had been
helping Zoie to redecorate her bedroom to fit the coming occasion."It is all done in pink and white," explained Aggie, and then followed
detailed accounts of the exquisite bed linens, the soft lovely hangings,
and even the entire relighting of the room.asked Jimmy, objecting to any scheme of Zoie's on general
principles."It's Alfred's favourite colour," explained Aggie."Besides, it's so
becoming," she added.Jimmy could not help feeling that this lure to Alfred's senses was
absolutely indecent, and he said so."Upon my word," answered Aggie, quite affronted, "you are getting as
unreasonable as Alfred himself."Then as Jimmy prepared to sulk, she
added coaxingly, "I was GOING to tell you about Zoie's lovely new
negligee, and about the dear little crib that just matches it."I can't think why you've taken such a dislike to that helpless child,"
said Aggie.A few days later, while in the midst of his morning's mail, Jimmy was
informed that it was now time for him to conduct Aggie and Zoie to the
Babies' Home to select the last, but most important, detail for
their coming campaign.According to instructions, Jimmy had been in
communication with the amused Superintendent of the Home, and he now led
the two women forth with the proud consciousness that he, at least, had
attended properly to his part of the business.By the time they reached
the Children's Home, several babies were on view for their critical
inspection.Zoie stared into the various cribs containing the wee, red mites with
puckered faces.she exclaimed, "haven't you any white ones?""These are supposed to be white," said the Superintendent, with an
indulgent smile, "the black ones are on the other side of the room."cried Zoie in horror, and she faced about quickly as
though expecting an attack from their direction."Which particular one of these would you recommend?"asked the practical
Aggie of the Superintendent as she surveyed the first lot."Well, it's largely a matter of taste, ma'am," he answered."This seems
a healthy little chap," he added, and seizing the long white clothes
of the nearest infant, he drew him across his arm and held him out for
Aggie's inspection."Let's see," cried Zoie, and she stood on tiptoe to peep over the
Superintendent's elbow.As for Jimmy, he stood gloomily apart.This was an ordeal for which
he had long been preparing himself, and he was resolved to accept it
philosophically."I don't think much of that one," snipped Zoie."It's not MY affair," answered Jimmy curtly.Aggie perceived trouble brewing, and she turned to pacify Jimmy."Which
one do you think your FRIEND ALFRED would like?""If I were in his place----" began Jimmy hotly."Oh, but you AREN'T," interrupted Zoie; then she turned to the
Superintendent."What makes some of them so much larger than others?"she asked, glancing at the babies he had CALLED "white.""Well, you see they're of different ages," explained the Superintendent
indulgently.Jinks they must all be of the same age," said Zoie with a
reproachful look at Jimmy."I should say a week old," said Aggie."Then this is the one for you," decided the Superintendent, designating
his first choice."I think we'd better take the Superintendent's advice," said Aggie
complacently.Zoie looked around the room with a dissatisfied air.Was it possible
that all babies were as homely as these?"You know, Zoie," explained Aggie, divining her thought, "they get
better looking as they grow older.""Fetch it home, Jimmy," said Aggie.exclaimed Jimmy, who had considered his mission completed."You don't expect US to carry it, do you?"The Superintendent settled the difficulty temporarily by informing them
that the baby could not possibly leave the home until the mother had
signed the necessary papers for its release."I thought all those details had been attended to," said Aggie, and
again the two women surveyed Jimmy with grieved disappointment."I'll get the mother's signature the first thing in the morning,"
volunteered the Superintendent."Very well," said Zoie, "and in the meantime, I'll send some new clothes
for it," and with a lofty farewell to the Superintendent, she and Aggie
followed Jimmy down stairs to the taxi."Now," said Zoie, when they were properly seated, "let's stop at a
telegraph office and let Jimmy send a wire to Alfred.""Wait until we get the baby," cautioned Aggie."We'll have it the first thing in the morning," argued Zoie."Jimmy can send him a night-letter," compromised Aggie, "that way Alfred
won't get the news until morning."A few minutes later, the taxi stopped in front of Jimmy's office and
with a sigh of thanksgiving he hurried upstairs to his unanswered mail.CHAPTER XIII

When Alfred Hardy found himself on the train bound for Detroit, he tried
to assure himself that he had done the right thing in breaking away
from an association that had kept him for months in a constant state of
ferment.Having settled this
point to his temporary satisfaction, he opened his afternoon paper
and leaned back in his seat, meaning to divert his mind from personal
matters, by learning what was going on in the world at large.No sooner had his eye scanned the first headline than he was startled by
a boisterous greeting from a fellow traveller, who was just passing down
the aisle.John journeyed to the garden."Detroit," answered Alfred, annoyed by the sudden interruption."THAT'S a funny thing," declared the convivial spirit, not guessing how
funny it really was."You know," he continued, so loud that everyone in
the vicinity could not fail to hear him, "the last time I met you two,
you were on your honeymoon--on THIS VERY TRAIN," and with that the
fellow sat himself down, uninvited, by Alfred's side and started on a
long list of compliments about "the fine little girl" who had in his
opinion done Alfred a great favour when she consented to tie herself to
a "dull, money-grubbing chap" like him."So," thought Alfred, "this is the way the world sees us."And he began
to frame inaudible but desperate defences of himself.Again he told
himself that he was right; but his friend's thoughtless words had
planted an uncomfortable doubt in his mind, and when he left the
train to drive to his hotel, he was thinking very little about the new
business relations upon which he was entering in Detroit, and very much
about the domestic relations which he had just severed in Chicago.Had he been merely a "dull money-grubber"?Had he left his wife too much
alone?Was she not a mere child when he married her?Could he not, with
more consideration, have made of her a more understanding companion?These were questions that were still unanswered in his mind when he
arrived at one of Detroit's most enterprising hotels.But later, having telephoned to his office and found that several
matters of importance were awaiting his decision, he forced himself to
enter immediately upon his business obligations.As might have been expected, Alfred soon won the respect and serious
consideration of most of his new business associates, and this in a
measure so mollified his hurt pride, that upon rare occasions he was
affable enough to accept the hospitality of their homes.But each
excursion that he made into the social life of these new friends, only
served to remind him of the unsettled state of his domestic affairs.his hostess would remark before they were
fairly seated at table."They tell me she is so pretty," his vis-a-vis would exclaim.Then his host would laugh and tell the "dear ladies" that in HIS
opinion, Alfred was afraid to bring his wife to Detroit, lest he might
lose her to a handsomer man.Alfred could never quite understand why remarks such as this annoyed him
almost to the point of declaring the whole truth.His LEAVING Zoie, and
his "losing" her, as these would-be comedians expressed it, were
two separate and distinct things in his mind, and he felt an almost
irresistible desire to make this plain to all concerned.But no sooner did he open his lips to do so, than a picture of Zoie in
all her child-like pleading loveliness, arose to dissuade him.He could
imagine his dinner companions all pretending to sympathise with him,
while they flayed poor Zoie alive.She would never have another chance
to be known as a respectable woman, and compared to most women of
his acquaintance, she WAS a respectable woman.True, according to
old-fashioned standards, she had been indiscreet, but apparently the
present day woman had a standard of her own.Alfred found his eye
wandering round the table surveying the wives of his friends.Was there
one of them, he wondered, who had never fibbed to her husband, or eaten
a simple luncheon unchaperoned by him?Of one thing he was certain,
there was not one of them so attractive as Zoie.Might she not be
forgiven, to some extent, if her physical charms had made her a source
of dangerous temptation to unprincipled scoundrels like the one with
whom she had no doubt lunched?Then, too, had she not offered at the
moment of his departure to tell him the "real truth"?Might this not
have been the one occasion upon which she would have done so?"She seemed
so sincere," he ruminated, "so truly penitent."Then again, how generous
it was of her to persist in writing to him with never an answer from
him to encourage her.If she cared for him so little as he had once
imagined, why should she wish to keep up even a presence of fondness?These were some of the thoughts that were going through Alfred's mind
just three months after his departure from Chicago, and all the while
his hostess was mentally dubbing him a "dull person."she said before he was down the front
steps."It's hard to believe, isn't it?"commented a third, and his host
apologised for the absent Alfred by saying that he was no doubt worried
about a particular business decision that had to be made the next
morning.But it was not the responsibility of this business decision that was
knotting Alfred's brow, as he walked hurriedly toward the hotel, where
he had told his office boy to leave the last mail.This had been
the longest interval that Zoie had ever let slip without writing.He
recalled that her last letters had hinted at a "slight indisposition."In fact, she had even mentioned "seeing the doctor"--"Good Heavens!"he
thought, "Suppose she were really ill?When Alfred reached his rooms, the boy had not yet arrived.He crossed
to the library table and took from the drawer all the letters thus far
received from Zoie."How could he have been
so stupid as not to have realised sooner that her illness--whatever it
was--had been gradually creeping upon her from the very first day of his
departure?"It contained no letter from Zoie and
Alfred went to bed with an uneasy mind.The next morning he was down at his office early, still no letter from
Zoie.Refusing his partner's invitation to lunch, Alfred sat alone in his
office, glad to be rid of intrusive eyes."He would write to Jimmy
Jinks," he decided, "and find out whether Zoie were in any immediate
danger."Not willing to await the return of his stenographer, or to acquaint her
with his personal affairs, Alfred drew pen and paper toward him and sat
helplessly before it.How could he inquire about Zoie without appearing
to invite a reconciliation with her?While he was trying to answer
this vexed question, a sharp knock came at the door.He turned to see a
uniformed messenger holding a telegram toward him.Intuitively he felt
that it contained some word about Zoie.His hand trembled so that he
could scarcely sign for the message before opening it.A moment later the messenger boy was startled out of his lethargy by a
succession of contradictory exclamations.cried Alfred incredulously as he gazed in ecstasy at the telegram.he shouted, excitedly, as he rose from his chair.he asked the astonished boy, and he began rummaging rapidly
through the drawers of his desk.And he thrust a bill into the small boy's
hand."Yes, sir," answered the boy and disappeared quickly, lest this madman
might reconsider his generosity.Alfred threw down the time table in despair."No train for Chicago until
night," he cried; but his mind was working fast.The next moment he was
at the telephone, asking for the Division Superintendent of the railway
line.When Alfred's partner returned from luncheon he found a curt note
informing him that Alfred had left on a special for Chicago and would
"write."CHAPTER XIV

During the evening of the same day that Alfred was enjoying such
pleasurable emotions, Zoie and Aggie were closeted in the pretty pink
and white bedroom that the latter had tried to describe to Jimmy.On
a rose-coloured couch in front of the fire sat Aggie threading ribbons
through various bits of soft white linen, and in front of her, at the
foot of a rose-draped bed, knelt Zoie.She was trying the effect of
a large pink bow against the lace flounce of an empty but inviting
bassinette.she called to Aggie, as she turned her head to one side
and surveyed the result of her experiment with a critical eye.Aggie shot a grudging glance at the bassinette."I wish you wouldn't
bother me every moment," she said."I'll never get all these things
finished."Apparently Zoie decided that the bow was properly placed, for she
applied herself to sewing it fast to the lining.In her excitement she
gave the thread a vicious pull."Oh, dear, oh dear, my thread is always
breaking!""Wouldn't YOU be excited," questioned Zoie'"if you were expecting a baby
and a husband in the morning?""I suppose I should," admitted Aggie.For a time the two friends sewed in silence, then Zoie looked up with
sudden anxiety."You're SURE Jimmy sent the wire?""I saw him write it," answered Aggie, "while I was in the office
to-day.""Oh, he won't GET it until to-morrow morning," said Aggie."I told you
that to-day."I wonder what he'll be doing when he gets it?"There was a
suspicion of a smile around her lips."What will he do AFTER he gets it?"Looking up at her friend in alarm, Zoie suddenly ceased sewing."You
don't mean he won't come?""Of course I don't," answered Aggie."He's only HUMAN if he is a
husband."There was a sceptical expression around Zoie's mouth, but she did not
pursue the subject."How do you suppose that red baby will ever look in
this pink basket?"And then with a regretful little sigh, she
declared that she wished she'd "used blue.""I didn't think the baby that we chose was so horribly red," said Aggie.cried Zoie, "it's magenta."she exclaimed in annoyance, and once more rethreaded her needle."I couldn't look at it," she continued with a disgusted little pucker of
her face."I wish they had let us take it this afternoon so I could have
got used to it before Alfred gets here.""Now don't be silly," scolded Aggie."You know very well that the
Superintendent can't let it leave the home until its mother signs the
papers.It will be here the first thing in the morning.You'll have all
day to get used to it before Alfred gets here.""ALL DAY," echoed Zoie, and the corners of her mouth began to droop."Won't Alfred be here before TO-MORROW NIGHT?"Aggie was becoming exasperated by Zoie's endless questions."I told
you," she explained wearily, "that the wire won't be delivered until
to-morrow morning, it will take Alfred eight hours to get here, and
there may not be a train just that minute.""Eight long hours," sighed Zoie dismally.And Aggie looked at her
reproachfully, forgetting that it is always the last hour that
is hardest to bear.Aggie was
meditating whether she should read her young friend a lecture on the
value of patience, when the telephone began to ring violently.Zoie looked up from her sewing with a frown."You answer it, will you,
Aggie?""Hello," called Aggie sweetly over the 'phone; then she added in
surprise, "Is this you, Jimmy dear?"Apparently it was; and as Zoie
watched Aggie's face, with its increasing distress she surmised that
Jimmy's message was anything but "dear."cried Aggie over the telephone, "that's awful!"was the first question that burst from Zoie's
lips.Aggie motioned to Zoie to be quiet.echoed Zoie joyfully; and without waiting for more details
and with no thought beyond the moment, she flew to her dressing table
and began arranging her hair, powdering her face, perfuming her lips,
and making herself particularly alluring for the prodigal husband's
return.Now the far-sighted Aggie was experiencing less pleasant sensations at
the phone.Then she asked irritably, "Well,
didn't you mark it 'NIGHT message'?"From the expression on Aggie's face
it was evident that he had not done so."But, Jimmy," protested Aggie,
"this is dreadful!Then calling to him to wait a
minute, and leaving the receiver dangling, she crossed the room to
Zoie, who was now thoroughly engrossed in the making of a fresh toilet.she exclaimed excitedly, "Jimmy made a mistake.""Of course he'd do THAT," answered Zoie carelessly."But you don't understand," persisted Aggie."They sent the 'NIGHT
message' TO-DAY.cried Zoie, and the next instant she was
waltzing gaily about the room."That's all very well," answered Aggie, as she followed Zoie with
anxious eyes, "but WHERE'S YOUR BABY?"cried Zoie, and for the first time she became conscious
of their predicament.She gazed at Aggie in consternation."I forgot all
about it," she said, and then asked with growing anxiety, "What can we
DO?"echoed Aggie, scarcely knowing herself what answer to make, "we've
got to GET it--TO-NIGHT."But," protested Zoie, "how CAN we get it when the mother hasn't signed
the papers yet?""Jimmy will have to arrange that with the Superintendent of the Home,"
answered Aggie with decision, and she turned toward the 'phone to
instruct Jimmy accordingly."Yes, that's right," assented Zoie, glad to be rid of all further
responsibility, "we'll let Jimmy fix it.""Say, Jimmy," called Aggie excitedly, "you'll have to go straight to the
Children's Home and get that baby just as quickly as you can.There's
some red tape about the mother signing papers, but don't mind about
that.Make them give it to you to-night.There was evidently a protest from the other end of the wire, for Aggie
added impatiently, "Go on, Jimmy, do!And with
that she hung up the receiver."Never mind about the clothes," answered Aggie."We're lucky if we get
the baby.""But I have to mind," persisted Zoie."I gave all its other things to
the laundress.And now the horrid
old creature hasn't brought them back yet.""You get into your OWN things," commanded Aggie.asked Zoie, her elation revived by the
thought of her fine raiment, and with that she flew to the foot of the
bed and snatched up two of the prettiest negligees ever imported from
Paris.she asked, as she held them both
aloft, "the pink or the blue?""It doesn't matter," answered Aggie wearily."Get into SOMETHING, that's
all.""Then unhook me," commanded Zoie gaily, as she turned her back to Aggie,
and continued to admire the two "creations" on her arm.So pleased was
she with the picture of herself in either of the garments that she began
humming a gay waltz and swaying to the rhythm."Stand still," commanded Aggie, but her warning was unnecessary, for at
that moment Zoie was transfixed by a horrible fear."Suppose," she said in alarm, "that Jimmy can't GET the baby?""He's GOT to get it," answered Aggie emphatically, and she undid the
last stubborn hook of Zoie's gown and put the girl from her."There,
now, you're all unfastened," she said, "hurry and get dressed.""You mean undressed," laughed Zoie, as she let her pretty evening gown
fall lightly from her shoulders and drew on her pink negligee.she exclaimed, as she caught sight of her reflection in the
mirror, "isn't it a love?"Alfred just adores
pink."answered Aggie, but in spite of herself, she was quite thrilled
by the picture of the exquisite young creature before her.Zoie had
certainly never looked more irresistible."Can't you get some of that
colour out of your cheeks," asked Aggie in despair."I'll put on some cold cream and powder," answered Zoie.She flew to her
dressing table; and in a moment there was a white cloud in her immediate
vicinity.She turned to Aggie to inquire the result."It couldn't be Alfred, could it?"asked Zoie with mingled hope and
dread."Of course not," answered Aggie, as she removed the receiver from the
hook."Alfred wouldn't 'phone, he would come right up."CHAPTER XV

Discovering that it was merely Jimmy "on the wire," Zoie's uneasiness
abated, but Aggie's anxiety was visibly increasing.she
repeated, then followed further explanations from Jimmy which were
apparently not satisfactory.cried his disturbed wife, "it
can't be!shrieked Zoie, trying to get her small ear close enough to
the receiver to catch a bit of the obviously terrifying message."Wait a minute," called Aggie into the 'phone.Then she turned to Zoie
with a look of despair."The mother's changed her mind," she explained;
"she won't give up the baby."cried Zoie, and she sank into the nearest chair.For an
instant the two women looked at each other with blank faces."What can
we DO," asked Zoie.This was indeed a serious predicament;
but presently Zoie saw her friend's mouth becoming very resolute, and
she surmised that Aggie had solved the problem."We'll have to get
ANOTHER baby, that's all," decided Aggie."There, in the Children's Home," answered Aggie with great confidence,
and she returned to the 'phone.Zoie crossed to the bed and knelt at its foot in search of her little
pink slippers."Oh, Aggie," she sighed, "the others were all so red!""Listen, Jimmy," she called in the
'phone, "can't you get another baby?"There was a pause, then Aggie
commanded hotly, "Well, GET in the business!"Another pause and then
Aggie continued very firmly, "Tell the Superintendent that we JUST MUST
have one."Zoie stopped in the act of putting on her second slipper and called a
reminder to Aggie."Tell him to get a HE one," she said, "Alfred wants a
boy."answered Aggie impatiently, and again she gave
her attention to the 'phone.she cried, with growing despair,
and Zoie waited to hear what had gone wrong now."Nothing under three
months," explained Aggie."A three-months' old baby is as big as a
whale.""Well, can't we say it GREW UP?"asked Zoie, priding herself on her
power of ready resource.Almost vanquished by her friend's new air of cold superiority, Zoie
was now on the verge of tears."Somebody must have a new baby," she
faltered."For their own personal USE, yes," admitted Aggie, "but who has a new
baby for US?""You're the one who ought to
know.You got me into this, and you've GOT to get me out of it.Can you
imagine," she asked, growing more and more unhappy, "what would happen
to me if Alfred were to come home now and not find a baby?He wouldn't
forgive a LITTLE lie, what would he do with a WHOPPER like this?"Then
with sudden decision, she rushed toward the 'phone."Let me talk to
Jimmy," she said, and the next moment she was chattering so rapidly and
incoherently over the 'phone that Aggie despaired of hearing one word
that she said, and retired to the next room to think out a new plan of
action."Say, Jimmy," stammered Zoie into the 'phone, "you've GOT to get me a
baby.If you don't, I'll kill myself!You got me
into this, Jimmy," she reminded him."You've GOT to get me out of it."And then followed pleadings and coaxings and cajolings, and at length,
a pause, during which Jimmy was apparently able to get in a word or so.she shrieked, tiptoeing
to get her lips closer to the receiver; then she added with conviction,
"the mother has no business to change her mind."Apparently Jimmy maintained that the mother had changed it none the
less."Well, take it away from her," commanded Zoie."Get it quick, while she
isn't looking."Then casting a furtive glance over her shoulder to make
sure that Aggie was still out of the room, she indulged in a few dark
threats to Jimmy, also some vehement reminders of how he had DRAGGED her
into that horrid old restaurant and been the immediate cause of all the
misfortunes that had ever befallen her.Could Jimmy have been sure that Aggie was out of ear-shot of Zoie's
conversation, the argument would doubtless have kept up indefinitely--as
it was--the result was a quick acquiescence on his part and by the time
that Aggie returned to the room, Zoie was wreathed in smiles."It's all right," she said sweetly."Goodness knows I hope so," she said,
then added in despair, "Look at your cheeks.Once more the powder puff was called into requisition, and Zoie turned a
temporarily blanched face to Aggie."Very much," answered Aggie, "but how about your hair?"Her reflection betrayed a
coiffure that might have turned Marie Antoinette green with envy."Would anybody think you'd been in bed for days?""Alfred likes it that way," was Zoie's defence."Turn around," said Aggie, without deigning to argue the matter further.And she began to remove handfuls of hairpins from the yellow knotted
curls.exclaimed Zoie, as she sprayed her white neck and
arms with her favourite perfume.Zoie leaned forward toward the mirror to smooth out her eyebrows with
the tips of her perfumed fingers."Good gracious," she cried in horror
as she caught sight of her reflection."You're not going to put my hair
in a pigtail!""That's the way invalids always have their hair," was Aggie's laconic
reply, and she continued to plait the obstinate curls.declared Zoie, and she shook herself free
from Aggie's unwelcome attentions and proceeded to unplait the hateful
pigtail."If you're going to make a perfect fright of me," pouted Zoie, "I just
won't see him.""He isn't coming to see YOU," reminded Aggie."He's coming to see the
baby.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, I'll not HAVE any baby," answered Zoie."Get into bed," said Aggie, and she proceeded to turn down the soft lace
coverlets.Her eyes caught the small knot of
lace and ribbons for which she was looking, and she pinned it on top of
her saucy little curls."In you go," said Aggie, motioning to the bed."Wait," said Zoie impressively, "wait till I get my rose lights on the
pillow."She pulled the slender gold chain of her night lamp; instantly
the large white pillows were bathed in a warm pink glow--she studied
the effect very carefully, then added a lingerie pillow to the two
more formal ones, kicked off her slippers and hopped into bed.One more
glance at the pillows, then she arranged the ribbons of her negligee to
fall "carelessly" outside the coverlet, threw one arm gracefully above
her head, half-closed her eyes, and sank languidly back against her
pillows.Controlling her impulse to smile, Aggie crossed to the dressing-table
with a business-like air and applied to Zoie's pink cheeks a third
coating of powder.Zoie sat bolt upright and began to sneeze."Aggie," she said, "I just
hate you when you act like that."But suddenly she was seized with a new
idea."I wonder," she mused as she looked across the room at the soft, pink
sofa bathed in firelight, "I wonder if I shouldn't look better on that
couch under those roses."Aggie was very emphatic in her opinion to the contrary."Then," decided Zoie with a mischievous smile, "I'll get Alfred to carry
me to the couch.That way I can get my arms around his neck.And once
you get your arms around a man's neck, you can MANAGE him."Aggie looked down at the small person with distinct disapproval."Now,
don't you make too much fuss over Alfred," she continued."YOU'RE the
one who's to do the forgiving.What's more," she
reminded Zoie, "you're very, very weak."But before she had time to
instruct Zoie further there was a sharp, quick ring at the outer door.The two women glanced at each other inquiringly.The next instant a
man's step was heard in the hallway.demanded someone in a voice tense with anxiety."Lie down," commanded Aggie, and Zoie had barely time to fall back
limply on the pillows when the excited young husband burst into the
room.CHAPTER XVI

When Alfred entered Zoie's bedroom he glanced about him in bewilderment.It appeared that he was in an enchanted chamber.Through the dim rose
light he could barely perceive his young wife.She was lying white and
apparently lifeless on her pillows.He moved cautiously toward the bed,
but Aggie raised a warning finger.Afraid to speak, he grasped Aggie's
hand and searched her face for reassurance; she nodded toward Zoie,
whose eyes were closed.He tiptoed to the bedside, sank on his knees and
reverently kissed the small hand that hung limply across the side of the
bed.To Alfred's intense surprise, his lips had barely touched Zoie's
fingertips when he felt his head seized in a frantic embrace."Alfred,
Alfred!"cried Zoie in delight; then she smothered his face with kisses.As she lifted her head to survey her astonished husband, she caught
the reproving eye of Aggie.With a weak little sigh, she relaxed her
tenacious hold of Alfred, breathed his name very faintly, and sank back,
apparently exhausted, upon her pillows."It's been too much for her," said the terrified young husband, and he
glanced toward Aggie in anxiety."How pale she looks," added Alfred, as he surveyed the white face on the
pillows."She's so weak, poor dear," sympathised Aggie, almost in a whisper.Alfred nodded his understanding to Aggie.It was then that his attention
was for the first time attracted toward the crib.And again Zoie forgot Aggie's warning and
sat straight up in bed.He was making
determinedly for the crib, his heart beating high with the pride of
possession.Throwing back the coverlets of the bassinette, Alfred stared at the
empty bed in silence, then he quickly turned to the two anxious women.Zoie's lips opened to answer, but no words came.Alfred's eyes turned to Aggie.The look on her face increased his worst
fears."Don't tell me he's----" he could not bring himself to utter the
word.He continued to look helplessly from one woman to the other.Aggie also made an unsuccessful
attempt to speak.Then, driven to desperation by the strain of the
situation, Zoie declared boldly: "He's out.""With Jimmy," explained Aggie, coming to Zoie's rescue as well as she
knew how."Just for a breath of air," explained Zoie sweetly She had now entirely
regained her self-possession."Isn't he very young to be out at night?"asked Alfred with a puzzled
frown."We told Jimmy that," answered Aggie, amazed at the promptness
with which each succeeding lie presented itself."But you see," she
continued, "Jimmy is so crazy about the child that we can't do anything
with him.""He always
said babies were 'little red worms.'""Not this one," answered Zoie sweetly."No, indeed," chimed in Aggie."I'll soon put a stop to that,"
he declared.Again the two women looked at each other inquiringly, then Aggie
stammered evasively."Oh, j-just downstairs--somewhere.""I'll LOOK j-just downstairs somewhere," decided Alfred, and he snatched
up his hat and started toward the door.Coming back to her bedside to reassure her, Alfred was caught in a
frantic embrace."I'll be back in a minute, dear," he said, but Zoie
clung to him and pleaded desperately."You aren't going to leave me the very first thing?"He had no wish to be cruel to Zoie, but the thought of
Jimmy out in the street with his baby at this hour of the night was not
to be borne."Now, dearie," she said, "I
wish you'd go get shaved and wash up a bit.I don't wish baby to see you
looking so horrid.""Yes, do, Alfred," insisted Aggie."He's sure to be here in a minute.""My boy won't care HOW his father looks," declared Alfred proudly, and
Zoie told Aggie afterward that his chest had momentarily expanded three
inches."But _I_ care," persisted Zoie."Now, Zoie," cautioned Aggie, as she crossed toward the bed with
affected solicitude.Zoie was quick to understand the suggested change in her tactics, and
again she sank back on her pillows apparently ill and faint.Utterly vanquished by the dire result of his apparently inhuman
thoughtlessness, Alfred glanced at Aggie, uncertain as to how to repair
the injury.Aggie beckoned to him to come away from the bed."Let her have her own way," she whispered with a significant glance
toward Zoie.Alfred nodded understandingly and put a finger to his lips to signify
that he would henceforth speak in hushed tones, then he tiptoed back to
the bed and gently stroked the curls from Zoie's troubled forehead."There now, dear," he whispered, "lie still and rest and I'll go shave
and wash up a bit.""Mind," he whispered to Aggie, "you are to call me the moment my boy
comes," and then he slipped quietly into the bedroom.No sooner had Alfred crossed the threshold, than Zoie sat up in bed and
called in a sharp whisper to Aggie, "What's keeping them?""I can't imagine," answered Aggie, also in whisper."If I had Jimmy here," declared Zoie vindictively, "I'd wring his little
fat neck," and slipping her little pink toes from beneath the covers,
she was about to get out of bed, when Aggie, who was facing Alfred's
bedroom door, gave her a warning signal.Zoie had barely time to get back beneath the covers, when Alfred
re-entered the room in search of his satchel.Aggie found it for him
quickly.Alfred glanced solicitously at Zoie's closed eyes."I'm so sorry," he
apologised to Aggie, and again he slipped softly out of the room.Aggie and Zoie drew together for consultation."Suppose Jimmy can't get the baby," whispered Zoie."In that case, he'd have 'phoned," argued Aggie."Let's 'phone to the Home," suggested Zoie, "and find----" She was
interrupted by Alfred's voice."Say, Aggie," called Alfred from the next room.answered Aggie sweetly, and she crossed to the door and waited."Not yet, Alfred," said Aggie, and she closed the door very softly, lest
Alfred should hear her."I never knew Alfred could be so silly!"warned Aggie, and she glanced anxiously toward Alfred's door."He doesn't care a bit about me!""It's all that horrid
old baby that he's never seen.""If Jimmy doesn't come soon, he never WILL see it," declared Aggie, and
she started toward the window to look out.Just then there was a short quick ring of the bell.The two women
glanced at each other with mingled hope and fear.Then their eyes sought
the door expectantly.CHAPTER XVII

With the collar of his long ulster pushed high and the brim of his derby
hat pulled low, Jimmy Jinks crept cautiously into the room.When he at
length ceased to glance over his shoulder and came to a full stop, Aggie
perceived a bit of white flannel hanging beneath the hem of his tightly
buttoned coat."Give it to me," demanded Aggie.Jimmy stared at them as though stupefied, then glanced uneasily over his
shoulder, to make sure that no one was pursuing him.Aggie unbuttoned
his ulster, seized a wee mite wrapped in a large shawl, and clasped it
to her bosom with a sigh of relief.she exclaimed, then
crossed quickly to the bassinette and deposited her charge.In the meantime, having thrown discretion to the wind, Zoie had hopped
out of bed.As usual, her greeting to Jimmy was in the nature of a
reproach."Yes," chimed in Aggie, who was now bending over the crib.answered Jimmy hotly, "if you two think you can do any
better, you're welcome to the job," and with that he threw off his
overcoat and sank sullenly on the couch.exclaimed Zoie and Aggie, simultaneously, and they glanced
nervously toward Alfred's bedroom door.Jimmy looked at them without comprehending why he should "sh."Instead, Zoie turned her back upon him."Let's see it," she said, peeping into the bassinette.And then with a
little cry of disgust she again looked at Jimmy reproachfully.Jimmy's contempt for woman's ingratitude was too
deep for words, and he only stared at her in injured silence.But his
reflections were quickly upset when Alfred called from the next room, to
inquire again about Baby.whispered Jimmy, beginning to realise the meaning of
the women's mysterious behaviour.said Aggie again to Jimmy, and Zoie flew toward the bed,
almost vaulting over the footboard in her hurry to get beneath the
covers.For the present Alfred did not disturb them further.Apparently he was
still occupied with his shaving, but just as Jimmy was about to ask for
particulars, the 'phone rang.The three culprits glanced guiltily at
each other.whispered Zoie in a frightened voice.Jimmy paused in the act of sitting and turned his round eyes toward the
'phone."But we can't," she was
saying; "that's impossible."called Zoie across the foot of the bed, unable longer to
endure the suspense."How dare you call my husband a
thief!""Wait a minute," said Aggie, then she left the receiver hanging by the
cord and turned to the expectant pair behind her."It's the Children's
Home," she explained."That awful woman says Jimmy STOLE her baby!"exclaimed Zoie as though such depravity on Jimmy's part were
unthinkable.Then she looked at him accusingly, and asked in low,
measured tones, "DID you STEAL HER BABY, JIMMY?""How else COULD I steal a baby?"Zoie looked at the unfortunate creature as if she could strangle him,
and Aggie addressed him with a threat in her voice."Well, the Superintendent says you've got to bring it straight back.""He sha'n't bring it back," declared Zoie.asked Aggie, "he's holding the
wire.""Tell him he can't have it," answered Zoie, as though that were the end
of the whole matter."Well," concluded Aggie, "he says if Jimmy DOESN'T bring it back the
mother's coming after it."As for Jimmy, he bolted for the door.Aggie caught him by the sleeve as
he passed."Wait, Jimmy," she said peremptorily.There was a moment of
awful indecision, then something approaching an idea came to Zoie."Tell the Superintendent that it isn't here," she whispered to Aggie
across the footboard."Tell him that Jimmy hasn't got here yet.""Yes," agreed Jimmy, "tell him I haven't got here yet."Aggie nodded wisely and returned to the 'phone."Hello," she called
pleasantly; then proceeded to explain.There was a pause, then she added in her most conciliatory tone, "I'll
tell him what you say when he comes in."Another pause, and she hung up
the receiver with a most gracious good-bye and turned to the others with
increasing misgivings."He says he won't be responsible for that mother
much longer--she's half-crazy.""Well," decided Aggie after careful deliberation, "you'd better take it
back, Jimmy, before Alfred sees it."And again Jimmy bolted, but again he
failed to reach the door.CHAPTER XVIII

His face covered with lather, and a shaving brush in one hand, Alfred
entered the room just as his friend was about to escape.exclaimed the excited young father, "you're back.""Oh, yes--yes," admitted Jimmy nervously, "I'm back."cried Alfred, and he glanced toward the crib."Yes--yes," agreed Aggie uneasily, as she tried to place herself between
Alfred and the bassinette."He's here, but you mayn't have him, Alfred."exclaimed Alfred, trying to put her out of the way."Not yet," protested Aggie, "not just yet.""Give him to me," demanded Alfred, and thrusting Aggie aside, he took
possession of the small mite in the cradle."But--but, Alfred," pleaded Aggie, "your face.He was bending over the cradle in an ecstasy.Lifting the baby in his arms he circled
the room cooing to him delightedly."Was he away from home when his fadder came?Suddenly he remembered to whom he owed this wondrous
treasure and forgetful of the lather on his unshaven face he rushed
toward Zoie with an overflowing heart.he exclaimed, and
he covered her cheek with kisses.cried Zoie in disgust and she pushed Alfred from her and
brushed the hateful lather from her little pink check.But Alfred was not to be robbed of his exaltation, and again he circled
the room, making strange gurgling sounds to Baby."Did a horrid old Jimmy take him away from fadder?"he said
sympathetically, in the small person's ear; and he glanced at Jimmy with
frowning disapproval."I'd just like to see him get you away from me
again!"he added to Baby, as he tickled the mite's ear with the end of
his shaving brush.he exclaimed in trepidation, as he
perceived a bit of lather on the infant's cheek.Then lifting the boy
high in his arms and throwing out his chest with great pride, he looked
at Jimmy with an air of superiority."I guess I'm bad, aye?"As for Zoie, she was growing more and more
impatient for a little attention to herself."Rock-a-bye, Baby," sang Alfred in strident tones and he swung the child
high in his arms.Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Alfred as though hypnotised.They kept time to
his lullaby out of sheer nervousness.Suddenly Alfred stopped, held the
child from him and gazed at it in horror."Look at that baby's face," commanded
Alfred.Zoie and Aggie exchanged alarmed glances, then Zoie asked in
trepidation, "What's the matter with his face?""He's got a fever," declared Alfred.And he started toward the bed to
show the child to its mother.shrieked Zoie, waving Alfred off in wild alarm.asked Alfred, backing from her in surprise.Aggie crossed quickly to Alfred's side and looked over his shoulder at
the boy."I don't see anything wrong with its face," she said."Oh," said Jimmy with a superior air, "they're always like that.""Nothing of the sort," snorted Alfred, and he glared at Jimmy
threateningly."You've frozen the child parading him around the
streets.""Let me have him, Alfred," begged Aggie sweetly; "I'll put him in his
crib and keep him warm."His eyes followed him to the crib
with anxiety.he asked, as he glanced first from
one to the other.Zoie and Jimmy stared about the room as though expecting the desired
person to drop from the ceiling.Then Zoie turned upon her unwary
accomplice."Jimmy," she called in a threatening tone, "where IS his nurse?""Does Jimmy take the nurse out, too?"demanded Alfred, more and more
annoyed by the privileges Jimmy had apparently been usurping in his
absence."Never mind about the nurse," interposed Aggie.I'll tuck him in," and she bent fondly over the crib, but Alfred
was not to be so easily pacified."Do you mean to tell me," he exclaimed excitedly, "that my boy hasn't
any nurse?""We HAD a nurse," corrected Zoie, "but--but I had to discharge her."Alfred glanced from one to the other for an explanation."She was crazy," stammered Zoie.Alfred's eyes sought Aggie's for confirmation.The latter jerked his head up and down in
nervous assent."Well," said Alfred, amazed at their apparent lack of resource, "why
didn't you get ANOTHER nurse?""Aggie is going to stay and take care of baby to-night," declared Zoie,
and then she beamed upon Aggie as only she knew how."Yes, indeed," answered Aggie, studiously avoiding Jimmy's eye."Baby is going to sleep in the spare room with Aggie and Jimmy," said
Zoie.exclaimed Jimmy, too desperate to care what Alfred might infer.Ignoring Jimmy's implied protest, Zoie continued sweetly to Alfred:

"Now, don't worry, dear; go back to your room and finish your shaving."Then his hand went
mechanically to his cheek and he stared at Zoie in astonishment.he exclaimed, "I had forgotten all about it.That shows you how
excited I am."And with a reluctant glance toward the cradle, he went
quickly from the room, singing a high-pitched lullaby.Just as the three conspirators were drawing together for consultation,
Alfred returned to the room.It was apparent that there was something
important on his mind."By the way," he said, glancing from one to another, "I forgot to
ask--what's his name?"The conspirators looked at each other without answering.Of course his son had been given his father's name,
but he wished to HEAR someone say so."Baby's, I mean," he explained impatiently.Jimmy felt instinctively that Zoie's eyes were upon him.called Zoie, meaning only to appeal to him for a name.After waiting in vain for any response, Alfred advanced upon the
uncomfortable Jimmy."You seem to be very popular around here," he sneered.Jimmy shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and studied the
pattern of the rug upon which he was standing.After what seemed an age to Jimmy, Alfred turned his back upon his old
friend and started toward his bedroom.Jimmy peeped out uneasily from
his long eyelashes.When Alfred reached the threshold, he faced about
quickly and stared again at Jimmy for an explanation.It seemed to Jimmy
that Alfred's nostrils were dilating.He would not have been surprised
to see Alfred snort fire.He let his eyes fall before the awful
spectacle of his friend's wrath.Alfred's upper lip began to curl.He
cast a last withering look in Jimmy's direction, retired quickly from
the scene and banged the door.When Jimmy again had the courage to lift his eyes he was confronted by
the contemptuous gaze of Zoie, who was sitting up in bed and regarding
him with undisguised disapproval."Why didn't you tell him what the baby's name is?""How do _I_ know what the baby's name is?"cautioned Aggie as she glanced nervously toward the door
through which Alfred had just passed."What does it matter WHAT the baby's name is so long as we have to send
it back?""I'll NOT send it back," declared Zoie emphatically, "at least not until
morning.That will give Jimmy a whole night to get another one.""See here, you two can't be changing babies
every five minutes without Alfred knowing it."You know perfectly well that all
young babies look just alike.Their own mothers couldn't tell them
apart, if it weren't for their clothes."Before Aggie could answer, Alfred was again heard calling from the next
room.Apparently all his anger had subsided, for he inquired in the most
amiable tone as to what baby might be doing and how he might be feeling.Aggie crossed quickly to the door, and sweetly reassured the anxious
father, then she closed the door softly and turned to Zoie and Jimmy
with a new inspiration lighting her face."I have it," she exclaimed
ecstatically."Now see here," he objected, "every time YOU 'HAVE IT,' I DO IT.The
NEXT time you 'HAVE IT' YOU DO IT!"The emphasis with which Jimmy made his declaration deserved
consideration, but to his amazement it was entirely ignored by both
women.Hopping quickly out of bed, without even glancing in his
direction, Zoie gave her entire attention to Aggie."There must be OTHER babies' Homes," said Aggie, and she glanced at
Jimmy from her superior height."They aren't open all night like corner drug stores," growled Jimmy."Well, they ought to be," decided Zoie."And surely," argued Aggie, "in an extraordinary case--like----"

"This was an 'extraordinary case,'" declared Jimmy, "and you saw what
happened this time, and the Superintendent is a friend of mine--at least
he WAS a friend of mine."And with that Jimmy sat himself down on the
far corner of the couch and proceeded to ruminate on the havoc that
these two women had wrought in his once tranquil life.Zoie gazed at Jimmy in deep disgust; her friend Aggie had made an
excellent suggestion, and instead of acting upon it with alacrity, here
sat Jimmy sulking like a stubborn child."I suppose," said Zoie, as her eyebrows assumed a bored angle, "there
are SOME babies in the world outside of Children's Homes.""Of course," was Aggie's enthusiastic rejoinder; "there's one born every
minute.""But I was born BETWEEN minutes," protested Jimmy.Again Aggie exclaimed that she "had it.""She's got it twice as bad," groaned Jimmy, and he wondered what new
form her persecution of him was about to take."We can't advertise NOW," protested Zoie.answered Aggie, as she snatched the paper quickly from
the table and began running her eyes up and down its third page."Married--married," she murmured, and then with delight she found
the half column for which she was searching."Born," she exclaimed
triumphantly.Get a pencil, Zoie, and we'll take down all
the new ones.""Of course," agreed Zoie, clapping her hands in glee, "and Jimmy can get
a taxi and look them right up."shouted Jimmy as he rose with clenched fists."Now you
two, see here----"

Before Jimmy could complete his threat, there was a sharp ring of the
door bell.He looked at the two women inquiringly."It's the mother," cried Zoie in a hoarse whisper.repeated Jimmy in terror and he glanced uncertainly from
one door to the other.called Zoie, and drawing Jimmy's overcoat quickly
from his arm, Aggie threw it hurriedly over the cradle.For an instant Jimmy remained motionless in the centre of the room,
hatless, coatless, and shorn of ideas.A loud knock on the door decided
him and he sank with trembling knees behind the nearest armchair, just
as Zoie made a flying leap into the bed and prepared to draw the cover
over her head.The knock was repeated and Aggie signalled to Zoie to answer it.CHAPTER XIX

From his hiding-place Jimmy peeped around the edge of the armchair and
saw what seemed to be a large clothes basket entering the room.Closer
inspection revealed the small figure of Maggie, the washerwoman's
daughter, propelling the basket, which was piled high with freshly
laundered clothing.Jimmy drew a long sigh of relief, and unknotted his
cramped limbs."Shall I lay the things on the sofa, mum?"asked Maggie as she placed
her basket on the floor and waited for Zoie's instructions."Yes, please," answered Zoie, too exhausted for further comment.Taking the laundry piece by piece from the basket, Maggie made excuses
for its delay, while she placed it on the couch.Deaf to Maggie's
chatter, Zoie lay back languidly on her pillows; but she soon heard
something that lifted her straight up in bed."Me mother is sorry she had to kape you waitin' this week," said Maggie
over her shoulder; "but we've got twins at OUR house."Then together they stared
at Maggie as though she had been dropped from another world.Finding attention temporarily diverted from himself, Jimmy had begun to
rearrange both his mind and his cravat when he felt rather than saw that
his two persecutors were regarding him with a steady, determined gaze.In spite of himself, Jimmy raised his eyes to theirs.Now, Jimmy had heard Maggie's announcement about the bountiful supply
of offspring lately arrived at her house, but not until he caught the
fanatical gleam in the eyes of his companions did he understand the
part they meant him to play in their next adventure.He waited for no
explanation--he bolted toward the door.But it was not until she had laid firm
hold of him that he waited.Surprised by such strange behaviour on the part of those whom she
considered her superiors, Maggie looked first at Aggie, then at Jimmy,
then at Zoie, uncertain whether to go or to stay."Anythin' to go back, mum?"Zoie stared at Maggie solemnly from across the foot of the bed."Maggie," she asked in a deep, sepulchral tone, "where do you live?""Just around the corner on High Street, mum," gasped Maggie.Then,
keeping her eyes fixed uneasily on Zoie she picked up her basket and
backed cautiously toward the door.commanded Zoie; and Maggie paused, one foot in mid-air."Wait in
the hall," said Zoie."Yes'um," assented Maggie, almost in a whisper.Then she nodded her
head jerkily, cast another furtive glance at the three persons who were
regarding her so strangely, and slipped quickly through the door.Having crossed the room and stealthily closed the door, Aggie returned
to Jimmy, who was watching her with the furtive expression of a trapped
animal."It's Providence," she declared, with a grave countenance.Jimmy looked up at Aggie with affected innocence, then rolled his round
eyes away from her.He was confronted by Zoie, who had approached from
the opposite side of the room."It's Fate," declared Zoie, in awe-struck tones.Jimmy was beginning to wriggle, but he kept up a last desperate presence
of not understanding them."You needn't tell me I'm going to take the wash to the old lady," he
said, "for I'm not going to do it.""It isn't the WASH," said Aggie, and her tone warned him that she
expected no nonsense from him."You know what we are thinking about just as well as we do," said Zoie."I'll write that washerwoman a note and tell her we must have one of
those babies right now."And with that she turned toward her desk and
began rummaging amongst her papers for a pencil and pad."The luck of
these poor," she murmured."The luck of US," corrected Aggie, whose spirits were now soaring.Then
she turned to Jimmy with growing enthusiasm."Just think of it, dear,"
she said, "Fate has sent us a baby to our very door.""Well," declared Jimmy, again beginning to show signs of fight, "if
Fate has sent a baby to the door, you don't need me," and with that he
snatched his coat from the crib."Wait, Jimmy," again commanded Aggie, and she took his coat gently but
firmly from him."Now, see here," argued Jimmy, trying to get free from his strong-minded
spouse, "you know perfectly well that that washerwoman isn't going to
let us have that baby.""Nonsense," called Zoie over her shoulder, while she scribbled a hurried
note to the washerwoman."If she won't let us have it 'for keeps,' I'll
just'rent it.'""Warm, fresh,
palpitating babies rented as you would rent a gas stove!""That's all a pose," declared Aggie, in a matter-of-fact tone."You
think babies 'little red worms,' you've said so.""She'll be only too glad to rent it," declared Zoie, as she glanced
hurriedly through the note just written, and slipped it, together with
a bill, into an envelope.It's only until I can
get another one."shouted Jimmy, and his eyes turned heavenward for help."An
endless chain with me to put the links together!""Don't be so theatrical," said Aggie, irritably, as she took up Jimmy's
coat and prepared to get him into it."Why DO you make such a fuss about NOTHING," sighed Zoie.echoed Jimmy, and he looked at her with wondering eyes."I crawl about like a thief in the night snatching babies from their
mother's breasts, and you call THAT nothing?""You don't have to 'CRAWL,'" reminded Zoie, "you can take a taxi.""Here's your coat, dear," said Aggie graciously, as she endeavoured to
slip Jimmy's limp arms into the sleeves of the garment."You can take Maggie with you," said Zoie, with the air of conferring a
distinct favour upon him."And the wash on my lap," added Jimmy sarcastically."No," said Zoie, unruffled by Jimmy's ungracious behaviour."That's very kind of you," sneered Jimmy, as he unconsciously allowed
his arms to slip into the sleeves of the coat Aggie was urging upon him."All you need to do," said Aggie complacently, "is to get us the baby.""Yes," said Jimmy, "and what do you suppose my friends would say if they
were to see me riding around town with the wash-lady's daughter and a
baby on my lap?he asked Aggie, "if you didn't know
the facts?""Nobody's going to see you," answered Aggie impatiently; "it's only
around the corner.Go on, Jimmy, be a good boy.""You mean a good thing," retorted Jimmy without budging from the spot.exclaimed Zoie; "it's as easy as can be.""Yes, the FIRST one SOUNDED easy, too," said Jimmy."All you have to do," explained Zoie, trying to restrain her rising
intolerance of his stupidity, "is to give this note to Maggie's mother.She'll give you her baby, you bring it back here, we'll give you THIS
one, and you can take it right back to the Home.""And meet the other mother," concluded Jimmy with a shake of his head.There was a distinct threat in Zoie's voice when she again addressed the
stubborn Jimmy and the glitter of triumph was in her eyes."You'd better meet here THERE than HERE," she warned him; "you know what
the Superintendent said.""That's true," agreed Aggie with an anxious face."Come now," she
pleaded, "it will only take a minute; you can do the whole thing before
you have had time to think.""Before I have had time to think," repeated Jimmy excitedly."That's how
you get me to do everything.Well, this time I've HAD time to think and
I don't think I will!"and with that he threw himself upon the couch,
unmindful of the damage to the freshly laundered clothes."You haven't time to sit down," said Aggie."I'll TAKE time," declared Jimmy.His eyes blinked ominously and he
remained glued to the couch.There was a short silence; the two women gazed at Jimmy in despair.Remembering a fresh grievance, Jimmy turned upon them."By the way," he said, "do you two know that I haven't had anything to
eat yet?""And do you know," said Zoie, "that Alfred may be back at any minute?"Not unless he has cut his throat," rejoined Jimmy, "and that's what I'd
do if I had a razor."Zoie regarded Jimmy as though he were beyond redemption."Can't you ever
think of anybody but yourself?"she asked, with a martyred air.Had Jimmy been half his age, Aggie would have felt sure that she saw him
make a face at her friend for answer.As it was, she resolved to make
one last effort to awaken her unobliging spouse to a belated sense of
duty."You see, dear," she said, "you might better get the washerwoman's baby
than to go from house to house for one," and she glanced again toward
the paper."Yes," urged Zoie, "and that's just what you'll HAVE to do, if you don't
get this one."It was apparent that his courage was
slipping from him.Aggie was quick to realise her opportunity, and
before Jimmy could protect himself from her treacherous wiles, she had
slipped one arm coyly about his neck."Now, Jimmy," she pleaded as she pressed her soft cheek to his throbbing
temple, and toyed with the bay curl on his perspiring forehead, "wont
you do this little teeny-weepy thing just for me?"Jimmy's lips puckered in a pout; he began to blink nervously.Aggie
slipped her other arm about his neck."You know," she continued with a baby whine, "I got Zoie into this, and
I've just got to get her out of it.You're not going to desert me,
are you, Jimmy?You WILL help me, won't you, dear?"Her breath was on
Jimmy's cheek; he could feel her lips stealing closer to his.He had not
been treated to much affection of late.His head drooped lower--he began
to twiddle the fob on his watch chain.she repeated, and her soft eyelashes just brushed the tip
of his retrousee nose.Jimmy's head was now wagging from side to side.she entreated a fourth time, and she kissed him full on the
lips.With a resigned sigh, Jimmy rose mechanically from the heap of crushed
laundry and held out his fat chubby hand."Give me the letter," he groaned."Here you are," said Zoie, taking Jimmy's acquiescence as a matter of
course; and she thrust the letter into the pocket of Jimmy's ulster."Now, when you get back with the baby," she continued, "don't come in
all of a sudden; just wait outside and whistle.You CAN WHISTLE, can't
you?"For answer, Jimmy placed two fingers between his lips and produced a
shrill whistle that made both Zoie and Aggie glance nervously toward
Alfred's bedroom door."Yes, you can WHISTLE," admitted Zoie, then she continued her
directions."If Alfred is not in the room, I'll raise the shade and you
can come right up."asked Jimmy with a fine shade of sarcasm."If he IS in the room," explained Zoie, "you must wait outside until I
can get rid of him."Jimmy turned his eyes toward Aggie to ask if it were possible that she
still approved of Zoie's inhuman plan.For answer Aggie stroked his coat
collar fondly."We'll give you the signal the moment the coast is clear," she said,
then she hurriedly buttoned Jimmy's large ulster and wound a muffler
about his neck."There now, dear, do go, you're all buttoned up," and
with that she urged him toward the door."Just a minute," protested Jimmy, as he paused on the threshold."Let me
get this right, if the shade is up, I stay down.""Not at all," corrected Aggie and Zoie in a breath."If the shade is up,
you come up."Jimmy cast another martyred look in Zoie's direction.he said, "you know it is only twenty-three
below zero and I haven't had anything to eat yet--and----"

"Yes, we know," interrupted the two women in chorus, and then Aggie
added wearily, "go on, Jimmy; don't be funny.""With a baby on my lap and the wash lady's
daughter, I won't be funny, oh no!"It is doubtful whether Jimmy would not have worked himself into another
state of open rebellion had not Aggie put an end to his protests by
thrusting him firmly out of the room and closing the door behind him.After this act of heroic decision on her part, the two women listened
intently, fearing that he might return; but presently they heard the
bang of the outer door, and at last they drew a long breath of relief.For the first time since Alfred's arrival, Aggie was preparing to sink
into a chair, when she was startled by a sharp exclamation from Zoie."Good heavens," cried Zoie, "I forgot to ask Maggie.""Boys or girls," said Zoie, with a solemn look toward the door through
which Jimmy had just disappeared."Well," decided Aggie, after a moment's reflection, "it's too late now.Anyway," she concluded philosophically, "we couldn't CHANGE it."CHAPTER XX

With more or less damage to himself consequent on his excitement, Alfred
completed his shaving and hastened to return to his wife and the babe.Finding the supposedly ill Zoie careering about the centre of the room
expostulating with Aggie, the young man stopped dumbfounded on the
threshold."Zoie," he cried in astonishment.For an instant the startled Zoie gazed at him stupefied."Why, I--I----" Her eyes sought Aggie's for a suggestion; there was no
answer there.It was not until her gaze fell upon the cradle that she
was seized by the desired inspiration."I just got up to see baby," she faltered, then putting one hand giddily
to her head, she pretended to sway.In an instant Alfred's arms were about her."You stay here, my darling," he said tenderly."I'll bring baby
to you," and after a solicitous caress he turned toward baby's crib and
bent fondly over the little one."Ah, there's father's man," he said.Oh, goodis g'acious," then followed an incoherent
muttering of baby talk, as he bore the youngster toward Zoie's bed."Come, my precious," he called to Zoie, as he sank down on the edge of
the bed.It had suddenly dawned upon her that
this was the name by which Alfred would no doubt call her for the rest
of her life.But Alfred did not see the look of disgust on Zoie's face."What a funny face," he cooed as he pinched the youngster's cheek."Great Scott, what a grip," he cried as the infant's fingers closed
around his own."Will you look at the size of those hands," he
exclaimed.Zoie and Aggie exchanged worried glances; the baby had no doubt
inherited his large hands from his mother."Say, Aggie," called Alfred, "what are all of these little specks
on baby's forehead?""One, two,
three," he counted.Zoie was becoming more and more uncomfortable at the close proximity of
the little stranger."Oh," said Aggie, with affected carelessness as she leaned over Alfred's
shoulder and glanced at baby's forehead.exclaimed Alfred excitedly, "that's dangerous, isn't it?And he rose and started hurriedly toward the
telephone, baby in arms."Don't be silly," called Zoie, filled with vague alarm at the thought of
the family physician's appearance and the explanations that this might
entail.Stepping between Alfred and the 'phone, Aggie protested frantically."You see, Alfred," she said, "it is better to have the rash OUT, it
won't do any harm unless it turns IN.""He's perfectly well," declared Zoie, "if you'll only put him in his
crib and leave him alone."he asked, and he
tickled the little fellow playfully in the ribs."I'll tell you what,"
he called over his shoulder to Zoie, "he's a fine looking boy."And then
with a mysterious air, he nodded to Aggie to approach.Aggie glanced at her, uncertain what
answer to make."I--I hadn't thought," she stammered weakly."Go on, go on," exclaimed the proud young father, "you can't tell me
that you can look at that boy and not see the resemblance.""Why," said Alfred, "he's the image of Zoie."Zoie gazed at the puckered red face in Alfred's arms.she
shrieked in disgust, then fall back on her pillows and drew the lace
coverlet over her face.Mistaking Zoie's feeling for one of embarrassment at being over-praised,
Alfred bore the infant to her bedside."See, dear," he persisted, "see
for yourself, look at his forehead.""I'd rather look at you," pouted Zoie, peeping from beneath the
coverlet, "if you would only put that thing down for a minute."exclaimed Alfred, as though doubting his own ears.But before
he could remonstrate further, Zoie's arms were about his neck and she
was pleading jealously for his attention."Please, Alfred," she begged, "I have scarcely had a look at you, yet."Alfred shook his head and turned to baby with an indulgent smile.It was
pleasant to have two such delightful creatures bidding for his entire
attention."Dear me, tink of mudder wanting to look at
a big u'gy t'ing like fadder, when she could look at a 'itty witty t'ing
like dis," and he rose and crossed to the crib where he deposited the
small creature with yet more gurgling and endearing.Zoie's dreams of rapture at Alfred's home coming had not included such
divided attention as he was now showing her and she was growing more and
more desperate at the turn affairs had taken.She resolved to put a stop
to his nonsense and to make him realise that she and no one else was the
lode star of his existence.She beckoned to Aggie to get out of the
room and to leave her a clear field and as soon as her friend had gone
quietly into the next room, she called impatiently to Alfred who was
still cooing rapturously over the young stranger.Finding Alfred deaf
to her first entreaty, Zoie shut her lips hard, rearranged her pretty
head-dress, drew one fascinating little curl down over her shoulder,
reknotted the pink ribbon of her negligee, and then issued a final and
imperious order for her husband to attend her."Yes, yes, dear," answered Alfred, with a shade of impatience."I'm
coming, I'm coming."And bidding a reluctant farewell to the small
person in the crib, he crossed to her side.Zoie caught Alfred's hand and drew him down to her; he smiled
complacently."Well," he said in the patronising tone that Zoie always resented."How
is hubby's little girl?""It's about time," pouted Zoie, "that you made a little fuss over me for
a change."He stooped to kiss the eager lips, but just
as his young wife prepared to lend herself to his long delayed embrace,
his mind was distracted by an uneasy thought."Do you think that Baby
is----"

He was not permitted to finish the sentence.Zoie drew him back to her with a sharp exclamation."Think of ME for a while," she commanded."My darling," expostulated Alfred with a shade of surprise at her
vehemence.Again he stooped to
embrace her and again his mind was directed otherwise."I wonder if Baby
is warm enough," he said and attempted to rise."Wonder about ME for a while," snapped Zoie, clinging to him
determinedly.Was it possible there was
anything besides Baby worth wondering about?Whether there was or not,
Zoie was no longer to be resisted and with a last regretful look at the
crib, he resigned himself to giving his entire attention to his spoiled
young wife.Gratified by her hard-won conquest, Zoie now settled herself in Alfred's
arms.John went to the bedroom."You haven't told me what you did all the time that you were away," she
reminded him."Oh, there was plenty to do," answered Alfred."That would be telling," laughed Alfred, as he pinched her small pink
ear."I wish to be 'told,'" declared Zoie; "I don't suppose you realise it,
but if I were to live a THOUSAND YEARS, I'd never be quite sure what you
did during those FEW MONTHS.""It was nothing that you wouldn't have been proud of," answered Alfred,
with an unconscious expansion of his chest."Do you love me as much as ever?""Behave yourself," answered Alfred, trying not to appear flattered
by the discovery that his absence had undoubtedly caused her great
uneasiness."You know I do," answered Alfred, with the diffidence of a school boy."Then kiss me," concluded Zoie, with an air of finality that left Alfred
no alternative.As a matter of fact, Alfred was no longer seeking an alternative.He was
again under the spell of his wife's adorable charms and he kissed her
not once, but many times."Foolish child," he murmured, then he laid her tenderly against the
large white pillows, remonstrating with her for being so spoiled, and
cautioning her to be a good little girl while he went again to see about
Baby.Zoie clung to his hand and feigned approaching tears."You aren't thinking of me at all?""And kisses are no
good unless you put your whole mind on them.Again Alfred stooped to humour the small importunate person who was so
jealous of his every thought, but just as his lips touched her forehead
his ear was arrested by a sound as yet new both to him and to Zoie."I don't know," answered Zoie, wondering if the cat could have got into
the room.A redoubled effort on the part of the young stranger directed their
attention in the right direction.exclaimed Alfred tragically, "it's Baby.And
with that, he rushed to the crib and clasped the small mite close to his
breast, leaving Zoie to pummel the pillows in an agony of vexation.After vain cajoling of the angry youngster, Alfred bore him excitedly to
Zoie's bedside."You'd better take him, dear," he said.To the young husband's astonishment, Zoie waved him from her in terror,
and called loudly for Aggie.But no sooner had Aggie appeared on the
scene, than a sharp whistle was heard from the pavement below.Attributing Zoie's uneasiness to a caprice of modesty, Alfred turned
from the cradle to reassure her."No one can see in way up here," he said.To Zoie's distress, the lowering of the shade was answered by a yet
shriller whistle from the street below."Was it 'up' or 'down'?"cried Zoie to Aggie in an agony of doubt, as
she tried to recall her instructions to Jimmy."I don't know," answered Aggie.Alarmed by
Zoie's increasing excitement, and thinking she was troubled merely by
a sick woman's fancy that someone might see through the window, Alfred
placed the babe quickly in its cradle and crossed to the young wife's
bed."It was up, dear," he said."Then I want it up," declared the seemingly perverse Zoie.A succession of emotional whistles set Zoie to pounding the pillows."Did I say 'up' or did I say 'down'?"moaned the half-demented Zoie,
while long whistles and short whistles, appealing whistles and impatient
whistles followed each other in quick succession."You said down, dear," persisted Alfred, now almost as distracted as his
wife."I wish you'd get out of here," she cried;
"you make me so nervous that I can't think at all.""Of course, dear," murmured Alfred, "if you wish it."And with a hurt
and perplexed expression on his face he backed quickly from the room.CHAPTER XXI

When Zoie's letter asking for the O'Flarety twin had reached that young
lady's astonished mother, Mrs.O'Flarety felt herself suddenly lifted to
a position of importance.Hardy a wantin' my little Bridget," she
exclaimed, and she began to dwell upon the romantic possibilities of
her offspring's future under the care of such a "foine stylish lady and
concluded by declaring it 'a lucky day entoirely.'"Jimmy had his misgivings about it being Bridget's "LUCKY day," but it
was not for him to delay matters by dwelling upon the eccentricities
of Zoie's character, and when Mrs.O'Flarety had deposited Bridget in
Jimmy's short arms and slipped a well filled nursing bottle into his
overcoat pocket, he took his leave hastily, lest the excited woman add
Bridget's twin to her willing offering.Once out of sight of the elated mother, Jimmy thrust the defenceless
Bridget within the folds of his already snug ulster, buttoned the
garment in such places as it would meet, and made for the taxi which,
owing to the upset condition of the street, he had been obliged to
abandon at the corner.Whether the driver had obtained a more promising "fare" or been run
in by the police, Jimmy never knew.At any rate it was in vain that he
looked for his vehicle.So intense was the cold that it was impossible
to wait for a chance taxi; furthermore, the meanness of the district
made it extremely unlikely that one would appear, and glancing guiltily
behind him to make sure that no one was taking cognisance of his strange
exploit, Jimmy began picking his way along dark lanes and avoiding the
lighted thoroughfare on which the "Sherwood" was situated, until he was
within a block of his destination.Panting with haste and excitement, he eventually gained courage to
dash through a side street that brought him within a few doors of the
"Sherwood."Again glancing behind him, he turned the well lighted corner
and arrived beneath Zoie's window to find one shade up and one down.In
his perplexity he emitted a faint whistle.Immediately he saw the other
shade lowered.Uncertain as to what arrangement he had actually made
with Zoie, he ventured a second whistle.The result was a hysterical
running up and down of the shade which left him utterly bewildered as to
what disposition he was supposed to make of the wobbly bit of humanity
pressed against his shirt front.Reaching over his artificially curved figure to grasp a bit of white
that trailed below his coat, he looked up to see a passing policeman
eyeing him suspiciously."Ye-yes," mumbled Jimmy with affected nonchalence and he knocked the
heels of his boots together in order to keep his teeth from chattering."It's a fi-fine ni-night for air," he stuttered.said the policeman, and to Jimmy's horror, he saw the fellow's
eyes fix themselves on the bit of white."Go-good-night," stammered Jimmy hurriedly, and trying to assume an
easy stride in spite of the uncomfortable addition to his already rotund
figure, he slipped into the hotel, where avoiding the lighted elevator,
he laboured quickly, up the stairs.At the very moment when Zoie was driving Alfred in consternation from
the room, Jimmy entered it uninvited."Get out," was the inhospitable greeting received simultaneously from
Zoie and Aggie, and without waiting for further instructions he "got."Fortunately for all concerned, Alfred, who was at the same moment
departing by way of the bedroom door, did not look behind him; but it
was some minutes before Aggie who had followed Jimmy into the hall could
persuade him to return.After repeated and insistent signals both from Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy's
round red face appeared cautiously around the frame of the door.It bore
unmistakable indications of apoplexy.But the eyes of the women were not
upon Jimmy's face, they too had caught sight of the bit of white that
hung below his coat, and dragging him quickly into the room and closing
the door, Aggie proceeded without inquiry or thanks to unbutton his coat
and to take from beneath it the small object for which she and Zoie had
been eagerly waiting.sighed Zoie, as she saw Aggie bearing the latest
acquisition to Alfred's rapidly increasing family safely toward the
crib.Suddenly remembering something in his right hand coat pocket, Jimmy
called to Aggie, who turned to him and waited expectantly.After
characteristic fumbling, he produced a well filled nursing bottle."For HER," grunted Jimmy, and he nodded toward the bundle in Aggie's
arms.cried Zoie and Aggie in chorus.Zoie shut her lips hard and gazed
at him with contempt."I might have known you'd get the wrong kind," she said.What Jimmy thought about the ingratitude of woman was not to be
expressed in language.He controlled himself as well as he could and
merely LOOKED the things that he would like to have said."Well, it can't be helped now," decided the philosophic Aggie; "here,
Jimmy," she said, "you hold 'HER' a minute and I'll get you the other
one."Placing the small creature in Jimmy's protesting arms, Aggie turned
toward the cradle to make the proposed exchange when she was startled by
the unexpected return of Alfred.Thanks to the ample folds of Jimmy's ulster, he was able to effectually
conceal his charge and he started quickly toward the hall, but in making
the necessary detour around the couch he failed to reach the door before
Alfred, who had chosen a more direct way."Hold on, Jimmy," exclaimed Alfred good-naturedly, and he laid a
detaining hand on his friend's shoulder."I'll be back," stammered Jimmy weakly, edging his way toward the door,
and contriving to keep his back toward Alfred."Wait a minute," said Alfred jovially, as he let his hand slip onto
Jimmy's arm, "you haven't told me the news yet.""I'll tell you later," mumbled Jimmy, still trying to escape.But
Alfred's eye had fallen upon a bit of white flannel dangling below
the bottom of Jimmy's ulster, it travelled upward to Jimmy's unusually
rotund figure.he demanded to know, as he pointed toward the
centre button of Jimmy's overcoat.echoed Jimmy vapidly, glancing at the button in question, "why,
that's just a little----" There was a faint wail from the depths of
the ulster.Jimmy began to caper about with elephantine tread."Oochie,
coochie, oochie," he called excitedly.cried the anxious father, "it's my boy."And with that
he pounced upon Jimmy, threw wide his ulster and snatched from his arms
Jimmy's latest contribution to Zoie's scheme of things.As Aggie had previously remarked, all young babies look very much alike,
and to the inexperienced eye of this new and overwrought father, there
was no difference between the infant that he now pressed to his breast,
and the one that, unsuspected by him, lay peacefully dozing in the crib,
not ten feet from him.He gazed at the face of the newcomer with the
same ecstasy that he had felt in the possession of her predecessor.But
Zoie and Aggie were looking at each other with something quite different
from ecstasy."My boy," exclaimed Alfred, with deep emotion, as he clasped the tiny
creature to his breast."What were you doing
with my baby?""I--I was just taking him out for a little walk!""You just try," threatened Alfred, and he towered over the intimidated
Jimmy.Jimmy was of the opinion that he must be crazy or he would never have
found himself in such a predicament as this, but the anxious faces of
Zoie and Aggie, denied him the luxury of declaring himself so.He sank
mutely on the end of the couch and proceeded to sulk in silence.As for Aggie and Zoie, they continued to gaze open-mouthed at Alfred,
who was waltzing about the room transported into a new heaven of delight
at having snatched his heir from the danger of another night ramble with
Jimmy."Did a horrid old Jimmy spoil his 'itty nap'?"Then
with a sudden exclamation of alarm, he turned toward the anxious women.he cried, as he stared intently into Baby's face.Aggie pretended to glance over Alfred's shoulder."Why so it has," she agreed nervously."It's all right now," counselled Aggie, "so long as it didn't turn in
too suddenly.""We'd better keep him warm, hadn't we?"suggested Alfred, remembering
Aggie's previous instructions on a similar occasion."I'll put him in
his crib," he decided, and thereupon he made a quick move toward the
bassinette.Staggering back from the cradle with the unsteadiness of a drunken man
Alfred called upon the Diety.he demanded as he pointed
toward the unexpected object before him.Neither Zoie, Aggie, nor Jimmy could command words to assist Alfred's
rapidly waning powers of comprehension, and it was not until he had
swept each face for the third time with a look of inquiry that Zoie
found breath to stammer nervously, "Why--why--why, that's the OTHER
one."echoed Alfred in a dazed manner; then he turned to
Aggie for further explanation."Yes," affirmed Aggie, with an emphatic nod, "the other one."An undescribable joy was dawning on Alfred's face."You don't mean----" He stared from the infant in his arms to the one in
the cradle, then back again at Aggie and Zoie.Alfred turned toward
Zoie for the final confirmation of his hopes."Yes, dear," assented Zoie sweetly, "that's Alfred."What Jimmy and the women saw next appeared to be the dance of a whirling
dervish; as a matter of fact, it was merely a man, mad with delight,
clasping two infants in long clothes and circling the room with them.When Alfred could again enunciate distinctly, he rushed to Zoie's side
with the babes in his arms."My darling," he exclaimed, "why didn't you tell me?""I was ashamed," whispered Zoie, hiding her head to shut out the sight
of the red faces pressed close to hers.cried Alfred, struggling to control his complicated
emotions; then gazing at the precious pair in his arms, he cast his eyes
devoutly toward heaven, "Was ever a man so blessed?"Zoie peeped from the covers with affected shyness."I love you TWICE as much," declared Alfred, and with that he sank
exhausted on the foot of the bed, vainly trying to teeter one son on
each knee.CHAPTER XXII

When Jimmy gained courage to turn his eyes in the direction of the
family group he had helped to assemble, he was not reassured by the
reproachful glances that he met from Aggie and Zoie.It was apparent
that in their minds, he was again to blame for something.Realising that
they dared not openly reproach him before Alfred, he decided to make his
escape while his friend was still in the room.He reached for his hat
and tiptoed gingerly toward the door, but just as he was congratulating
himself upon his decision, Alfred called to him with a mysterious air."Jimmy," he said, "just a minute," and he nodded for Jimmy to approach.It must have been Jimmy's guilty conscience that made him powerless
to disobey Alfred's every command.Anyway, he slunk back to the fond
parent's side, where he ultimately allowed himself to be inveigled into
swinging his new watch before the unattentive eyes of the red-faced
babes on Alfred's knees."Lower, Jimmy, lower," called Alfred as Jimmy absent-mindedly allowed
the watch to swing out of the prescribed orbit."Look at the darlings,
Jimmy, look at them," he exclaimed as he gazed at the small creatures
admiringly."Yes, look at them, Jimmy," repeated Zoie, and she glared at Jimmy
behind Alfred's back."Don't you wish you had one of them, Jimmy?'""Well, _I_ wish he had," commented Zoie, and she wondered how she was
ever again to detach either of them from Alfred's breast.Before she could form any plan, the telephone rang loud and
persistently.Jimmy glanced anxiously toward the women for instructions."I'll answer it," said Aggie with suspicious alacrity, and she crossed
quickly toward the 'phone.The scattered bits of conversation that Zoie
was able to gather from Aggie's end of the wire did not tend to soothe
her over-excited nerves.As for Alfred, he was fortunately so engrossed
with the babies that he took little notice of what Aggie was saying."Certainly not," exclaimed Aggie,
"don't let her come up; send her away.Hardy can't see anyone at
all."Then followed a bit of pantomime between Zoie and Aggie, from
which it appeared that their troubles were multiplying, then Aggie again
gave her attention to the 'phone."I don't know anything about her," she
fibbed, "that woman must have the wrong address."And with that she hung
up the receiver and came towards Alfred, anxious to get possession of
his two small charges and to get them from the room, lest the mother who
was apparently downstairs should thrust herself into their midst.asked Alfred, and he nodded toward the
telephone."Oh, just some woman with the wrong address," answered Aggie with
affected carelessness."You'd better let me take the babies now,
Alfred.""To bed," answered Aggie sweetly, "they are going to sleep in the next
room with Jimmy and me."She laid a detaining hand on Jimmy's arm."It's very late," argued Aggie."Of course it is," insisted Zoie."Please, Alfred," she pleaded, "do let
Aggie take them.""Mother knows best," he sighed, but ignoring
Aggie's outstretched arms, he refused to relinquish the joy of himself
carrying the small mites to their room, and he disappeared with the two
of them, singing his now favourite lullaby.When Alfred had left the room, Jimmy, who was now seated comfortably in
the rocker, was rudely startled by a sharp voice at either side of him.shrieked Zoie, with all the disapproval that could be got into
the one small word."You're very clever, aren't you?"sneered Aggie at Jimmy's other elbow."A nice fix you've got me into NOW," reproved Zoie."Why didn't you get out when you had the chance?""You would take your own sweet time, wouldn't you," said Zoie.exclaimed Zoie, and she walked up and down the room
excitedly, oblivious of the disarrangement of her flying negligee."Oh yes," assented Jimmy, as he sank back into the rocker and
began propelling himself to and fro."I never felt better," but a
disinterested observer would have seen in him the picture of discomfort."You're going to feel a great deal WORSE," he was warned by Aggie."Do
you know who that was on the telephone?""She's down stairs," explained Aggie.Jimmy had stopped rocking--his face now wore an uneasy expression."It's time you showed a little human intelligence," taunted Zoie, then
she turned her back upon him and continued to Aggie, "what did she say?""She says," answered Aggie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy,
"that she won't leave this place until Jimmy gives her baby back.""Let her have her old baby," said Jimmy.snapped Zoie indignantly, "what have YOU got to do
with it?""Oh nothing, nothing," acquiesced Jimmy meekly, "I'm a mere detail.""A lot you care what becomes of me," exclaimed Zoie reproachfully; then
she turned to Aggie with a decided nod."Well, I want it," she asserted."But Zoie," protested Aggie in astonishment, "you can't mean to keep
BOTH of them?""Jimmy has presented Alfred with twins," continued Zoie testily, "and
now, he has to HAVE twins."Jimmy's eyes were growing rounder and rounder."Do you know," continued Zoie, with a growing sense of indignation,
"what would happen to me if I told Alfred NOW that he WASN'T the father
of twins?He'd fly straight out of that door and I'd never see him
again."Aggie admitted that Zoie was no doubt speaking the truth."Jimmy has awakened Alfred's paternal instinct for twins," declared
Zoie, with another emphatic nod of her head, "and now Jimmy must take
the consequences."Jimmy tried to frame a few faint objections, but Zoie waved him aside,
with a positive air.If it were only ONE, it
wouldn't be so bad, but to tell Alfred that he's lost twins, he couldn't
live through it.""But Zoie," argued Aggie, "we can't have that mother hanging around down
stairs until that baby is an old man.She'll have us arrested, the next
thing."asked Zoie, with wide baby eyes.And she nodded toward the now utterly vanquished
Jimmy."That's right," murmured Jimmy, with a weak attempt at sarcasm, "don't
leave me out of anything good.""It doesn't matter WHICH one she arrests," decided the practical Aggie."Well, it matters to me," objected Zoie."And to me too, if it's all the same to you," protested Jimmy."Whoever it is," continued Aggie, "the truth is bound to come out.Alfred will have to know sooner or later, so we might as well make a
clean breast of it, first as last.""That's the first sensible thing you've said in three months," declared
Jimmy with reviving hope.sneered Zoie, and she levelled her most malicious look
at Jimmy."What do you think Alfred would do to YOU, Mr.Jimmy, if he
knew the truth?YOU'RE the one who sent him the telegram; you are the
one who told him that he was a FATHER.""That's true," admitted Aggie, with a wrinkled forehead.Zoie was quick to see her advantage."And Alfred
hasn't any sense of humour, you know."And with that he
sank into his habitual state of dumps."Your sarcasm will do a great deal of good," flashed Zoie.Then she
dismissed him with a nod, and crossed to her dressing table."But Zoie," persisted Aggie, as she followed her young friend in
trepidation, "don't you realise that if you persist in keeping this
baby, that mother will dog Jimmy's footsteps for the rest of his life?""That will be nice," murmured Jimmy.Zoie busied herself with her toilet, and turned a deaf ear to Aggie.There was a touch of genuine emotion in Aggie's voice when she
continued."Just think of it, Zoie, Jimmy will never be able to come and go like a
free man again.""What do I care how he comes and goes?""If
Jimmy had gone when we told him to go, that woman would have had her old
baby by now; but he didn't, oh no!All he ever does is to sit around and
talk about his dinner.""Yes," cried Jimmy hotly, "and that's about as far as I ever GET with
it.""You'll never get anywhere with anything," was Zoie's exasperating
answer."Well, there's nothing slow about you," retorted Jimmy, stung to a
frenzy by her insolence."Oh please, please," interposed Aggie, desperately determined to keep
these two irascible persons to the main issue."What are we going to
tell that mother?""You can tell her whatever you like," answered Zoie, with an impudent
toss of her head, "but I'll NOT give up that baby until I get ANOTHER
one.'It was apparent that he must needs
increase the number of his brain cells if he were to follow this
extraordinary young woman's line of thought much further."You don't
expect to go on multiplying them forever, do you?""YOU are the one who has been multiplying them," was Zoie's
disconcerting reply.It was evident to Jimmy that he could not think fast enough nor clearly
enough to save himself from a mental disaster if he continued to argue
with the shameless young woman, so he contented himself by rocking to
and fro and murmuring dismally that he had "known from the first that it
was to be an endless chain."While Zoie and Jimmy had been wrangling, Aggie had been weighing the
pros and cons of the case.She now turned to Jimmy with a tone of firm
but motherly decision."Zoie is quite right," she said.Jimmy rolled his large eyes up at his spouse with a "you too, Brutus,"
expression.Aggie continued mercilessly, "It's the only way, Jimmy."No sooner had Aggie arrived at her decision than Zoie upset her
tranquillity by a triumphant expression of "I have it."Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Zoie's radiant face in consternation.They were
accustomed to see only reproach there.Her sudden enthusiasm increased
Jimmy's uneasiness."YOU have it," he grunted without attempting to conceal his disgust."SHE'S the one who generally has it."Inflamed by her young friend's enthusiasm, Aggie rushed to her eagerly.exclaimed Zoie, as though the revelation had come
straight from heaven."SHE HAD TWINS," and with that, two pairs of eyes
turned expectantly toward the only man in the room.Tracing the pattern of the rug with his toe, Jimmy remained stubbornly
oblivious of their attentions.He rearranged the pillows on the couch,
and finally, for want of a better occupation, he wound his watch.He could feel Zoie's cat-like gaze upon him."Jimmy can get the other one," she said."The hell I can," exclaimed Jimmy, starting to his feet and no longer
considering time or place.The two women gazed at him reproachfully.cried Aggie, in a shocked, hurt voice."That's the first time
I've ever heard you swear.""Well, it won't be the LAST time," declared Jimmy hotly, "if THIS keeps
up."He paced to and fro like an infuriated lion."Dearest," said Aggie, "you look almost imposing.""Nonsense," interrupted Zoie, who found Jimmy unusually ridiculous."If
I'd known that Jimmy was going to put such an idea into Alfred's head,
I'd have got the two in the first place.""Of course she will," answered Zoie, leaving Jimmy entirely out of
the conversation."She's as poor as a church mouse.What could she do with one twin, anyway?"A snort of rage from Jimmy did not disturb Zoie's enthusiasm.She
proceeded to elaborate her plan."I'll adopt them," she declared, "I'll leave them all Alfred's money.Think of Alfred having real live twins for keeps.""It would be nice, wouldn't it?"Zoie turned to Jimmy, as though they were on the best of terms.Before Jimmy could declare himself penniless, Aggie answered for him
with the greatest enthusiasm, "He has a whole lot; he drew some today."exclaimed Zoie to the abashed Jimmy, and then she continued in a
matter-of-fact tone, "Now, Jimmy," she said, "you go give the washwoman
what money you have on account, then tell her to come around here in the
morning when Alfred has gone out and I'll settle all the details with
her.Go on now, Jimmy," she continued, "you don't need another letter.""No," chimed in Aggie sweetly; "you know her now, dear.""Oh, yes," corroborated Jimmy, with a sarcastic smile and without
budging from the spot on which he stood, "we are great pals now."asked Zoie, astonished that Jimmy was not starting
on his mission with alacrity."You know what happened the last time you hesitated," warned Aggie."I know what happened when I DIDN'T hesitate," ruminated Jimmy, still
holding his ground.Zoie's eyes were wide with surprise."You don't mean to say," she
exclaimed incredulously, "that you aren't GOING--after we have thought
all this out just to SAVE you?""Say," answered Jimmy, with a confidential air, "do me a favour, will
you?"But, Jimmy----" protested both women simultaneously; but before they
could get further Alfred's distressed voice reached them from the next
room.CHAPTER XVIII

What seemed to be a streak of pink through the room was in reality Zoie
bolting for the bed.While Zoie hastened to snuggle comfortably under the covers, Aggie tried
without avail to get Jimmy started on his errand.Getting no response from Aggie, Alfred, bearing one infant in his arms,
came in search of her.Apparently he was having difficulty with the
unfastening of baby's collar."Aggie," he called sharply, "how on earth do you get this fool pin out?""Take him back, Alfred," answered Aggie impatiently; "I'll be there in a
minute."But Alfred had apparently made up his mind that he was not a success as
a nurse."You'd better take him now, Aggie," he decided, as he offered the small
person to the reluctant Aggie."I'll stay here and talk to Jimmy.""Oh, but Jimmy was just going out," answered Aggie; then she turned to
her obdurate spouse with mock sweetness, "Weren't you, dear?""Yes," affirmed Zoie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy."Just for a little air," explained Aggie blandly."Yes," growled Jimmy, "another little heir.""He had air a while ago with my
son.He is going to stay here and tell me the news.Sit down, Jimmy,"
he commanded, and to the intense annoyance of Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy sank
resignedly on the couch.Alfred was about to seat himself beside his friend, when the 'phone rang
violently.Being nearest to the instrument, Alfred reached it first and
Zoie and Aggie awaited the consequences in dread.What they heard did
not reassure them nor Jimmy.Jimmy began to wriggle with a vague uneasiness."Well," continued Alfred at the 'phone, "that woman has the wrong
number."Then with a peremptory "Wait a minute," he turned to Zoie, "The
hall boy says that woman who called a while ago is still down stairs and
she won't go away until she has seen you, Zoie.She has some kind of an
idiotic idea that you know where her baby is.""Well," decided Alfred, "I'd better go down stairs and see what's
the matter with her," and he turned toward the door to carry out his
intention.She was half out of bed in her anxiety.'Phone down to the boy to send her away."Oh," said Alfred, "then she's been here before?answered Zoie, trying to gain time for a new inspiration."Why, she's--she's----" her face lit up with satisfaction--the idea had
arrived."She's the nurse," she concluded emphatically."Yes," answered Zoie, pretending to be annoyed with his dull memory."She's the one I told you about, the one I had to discharge.""Oh," said Alfred, with the relief of sudden comprehension; "the crazy
one?"Aggie and Zoie nodded their heads and smiled at him tolerantly, then
Zoie continued to elaborate."You see," she said, "the poor creature was
so insane about little Jimmy that I couldn't go near the child.""I'll soon tell the boy what
to do with her," he declared, and he rushed to the 'phone.Barely had
Alfred taken the receiver from the hook when the outer door was heard
to bang.Before he could speak a distracted young woman, whose excitable
manner bespoke her foreign origin, swept through the door without seeing
him and hurled herself at the unsuspecting Zoie.The woman's black hair
was dishevelled, and her large shawl had fallen from her shoulders.To
Jimmy, who was crouching behind an armchair, she seemed a giantess.cried the frenzied mother, with what was unmistakably an
Italian accent.There was no answer; her eyes sought
the cradle.she shrieked, then upon finding the cradle empty, she
redoubled her lamentations and again she bore down upon the terrified
Zoie."You," she cried, "you know where my baby is!"For answer, Zoie sank back amongst her pillows and drew the bed covers
completely over her head.Alfred approached the bed to protect his young
wife; the Italian woman wheeled about and perceived a small child in his
arms."I knew it," she cried; "I knew it!"Managing to disengage himself from what he considered a mad woman, and
elevating one elbow between her and the child, Alfred prevented the
mother from snatching the small creature from his arms."Calm yourself, madam," he commanded with a superior air."We are very
sorry for you, of course, but we can't have you coming here and going on
like this.He's OUR baby and----"

"He's NOT your baby!"cried the infuriated mother; "he's MY baby.Give him to me," and with that she sprang upon the
uncomfortable Alfred like a tigress.Throwing her whole weight on his
uplifted elbow, she managed to pull down his arm until she could look
into the face of the washerwoman's promising young offspring.The air
was rent by a scream that made each individual hair of Jimmy's head
stand up in its own defence.He could feel a sickly sensation at the top
of his short thick neck."He's NOT my baby," wailed the now demented mother, little dreaming that
the infant for which she was searching was now reposing comfortably on a
soft pillow in the adjoining room.As for Alfred, all of this was merely confirmation of Zoie's statement
that this poor soul was crazy, and he was tempted to dismiss her with
worthy forbearance."I am glad, madam," he said, "that you are coming to your senses."Now, all would have gone well and the bewildered mother would no doubt
have left the room convinced of her mistake, had not Jimmy's nerves got
the better of his judgment.Having slipped cautiously from his position
behind the armchair he was tiptoeing toward the door, and was flattering
himself on his escape, when suddenly, as his forward foot cautiously
touched the threshold, he heard the cry of the captor in his wake, and
before he could possibly command the action of his other foot, he felt
himself being forcibly drawn backward by what appeared to be his too
tenacious coat-tails."If only they would tear," thought Jimmy, but thanks to the excellence
of the tailor that Aggie had selected for him, they did NOT "tear."Not until she had anchored Jimmy safely to the centre of the rug did the
irate mother pour out the full venom of her resentment toward him.From
the mixture of English and Italian that followed, it was apparent that
she was accusing Jimmy of having stolen her baby."Take me to him," she demanded tragically; "my baby--take me to him!""Humour her," whispered Alfred, much elated by the evidence of his
own self-control as compared to Jimmy's utter demoralisation under the
apparently same circumstances.Alfred was becoming vexed; he pointed first to his own forehead, then
to that of Jimmy's hysterical captor.He even illustrated his meaning
by making a rotary motion with his forefinger, intended to remind Jimmy
that the woman was a lunatic.Still Jimmy only stared at him and all the while the woman was becoming
more and more emphatic in her declaration that Jimmy knew where her baby
was."Sure, Jimmy," said Alfred, out of all patience with Jimmy's stupidity
and tiring of the strain of the woman's presence.cried the mother, and she towered over Jimmy with a wild light in
her eyes."Take me to him," she demanded; "take me to him."Jimmy rolled his large eyes first toward Aggie, then toward Zoie and at
last toward Alfred."Take her to him, Jimmy," commanded a concert of voices; and pursued by
a bundle of waving colours and a medley of discordant sounds, Jimmy shot
from the room.CHAPTER XXIV

The departure of Jimmy and the crazed mother was the occasion for a
general relaxing among the remaining occupants of the room.Exhausted
by what had passed Zoie had ceased to interest herself in the future.It
was enough for the present that she could sink back upon her pillows and
draw a long breath without an evil face bending over her, and without
the air being rent by screams.As for Aggie, she fell back upon the window seat and closed her eyes.The horrors into which Jimmy might be rushing had not yet presented
themselves to her imagination.Of the three, Alfred was the only one who had apparently received
exhilaration from the encounter.He was strutting about the room with
the babe in his arms, undoubtedly enjoying the sensations of a hero.When he could sufficiently control his feeling of elation, he looked
down at the small person with an air of condescension and again lent
himself to the garbled sort of language with which defenceless infants
are inevitably persecuted."Tink of dat horrid old woman wanting to steal our own little oppsie,
woppsie, toppsie babykins," he said.Then he turned to Zoie with an
air of great decision."That woman ought to be locked up," he declared,
"she's dangerous," and with that he crossed to Aggie and hurriedly
placed the infant in her unsuspecting arms."Here, Aggie," he said, "you
take Alfred and get him into bed."Glad of an excuse to escape to the next room and recover her self
control, Aggie quickly disappeared with the child.For some moments Alfred continued to pace up and down the room; then he
came to a full stop before Zoie."I'll have to have something done to that woman," he declared
emphatically."Jimmy will do enough to her," sighed Zoie, weakly."She's no business to be at large," continued Alfred; then, with a
business-like air, he started toward the telephone.He was now calling into the 'phone, "Give me
information."demanded Zoie, more and more disturbed by
his mysterious manner."One can't be too careful," retorted Alfred in his most paternal
fashion; "there's an awful lot of kidnapping going on these days.""Well, you don't suspect information, do you?"Again Alfred ignored her; he was intent upon things of more importance."Hello," he called into the 'phone, "is this information?"Apparently it
was for he continued, with a satisfied air, "Well, give me the Fullerton
Street Police Station."cried Zoie, sitting up in bed and looking about the room
with a new sense of alarm.shrieked the over-wrought young wife."Now, now, dear, don't get nervous,"
he said, "I am only taking the necessary precautions."And again he
turned to the 'phone.Alarmed by Zoie's summons, Aggie entered the room hastily.She was not
reassured upon hearing Alfred's further conversation at the 'phone."Is this the Fullerton Street Police Station?"echoed Aggie, and her eyes sought Zoie's inquiringly.called Alfred over his shoulder to the excited Aggie, then
he continued into the 'phone.Well, hello, Donneghey, this is your
old friend Hardy, Alfred Hardy at the Sherwood.I've just got back,"
then he broke the happy news to the no doubt appreciative Donneghey.he said, "I'm a happy father."Zoie puckered her small face in disgust.Alfred continued to elucidate joyfully at the 'phone."Doubles," he said, "yes--sure--on the level.""I don't know why you have to tell the whole neighbourhood," snapped
Zoie.But Alfred was now in the full glow of his genial account to his friend.he repeated in answer to an evident suggestion from the
other end of the line, "I should say I would.Tell
the boys I'll be right over.And say, Donneghey," he added, in a more
confidential tone, "I want to bring one of the men home with me.I
want him to keep an eye on the house to-night"; then after a pause, he
concluded confidentially, "I'll tell you all about it when I get there.It looks like a kidnapping scheme to me," and with that he hung up the
receiver, unmistakably pleased with himself, and turned his beaming face
toward Zoie."It's all right, dear," he said, rubbing his hands together with evident
satisfaction, "Donneghey is going to let us have a Special Officer to
watch the house to-night.""I won't HAVE a special officer," declared Zoie vehemently; then
becoming aware of Alfred's great surprise, she explained half-tearfully,
"I'm not going to have the police hanging around our very door.I would
feel as though I were in prison.""You ARE in prison, my dear," returned the now irrepressible Alfred."A
prison of love--you and our precious boys."He stooped and implanted a
gracious kiss on her forehead, then turned toward the table for his hat."Now," he said, "I'll just run around the corner, set up the drinks for
the boys, and bring the officer home with me," and drawing himself up
proudly, he cried gaily in parting, "I'll bet there's not another man in
Chicago who has what I have to-night.""I hope not," groaned Zoie.Then,
thrusting her two small feet from beneath the coverlet and perching on
the side of the bed, she declared to Aggie that "Alfred was getting more
idiotic every minute.""He's worse than idiotic," corrected Aggie.If
he gets the police around here before we give that baby back, they'll
get the mother.She'll tell all she knows and that will be the end of
Jimmy!"exclaimed Zoie, "it'll be the end of ALL of us.""I can see our pictures in the papers, right now," groaned Aggie."Jimmy IS a villain," declared Zoie.How am I ever going to get that other twin?""There is only one thing to do," decided Aggie, "I must go for it
myself."And she snatched up her cape from the couch and started toward
the door.cried Zoie, in alarm, "and leave me alone?""It's our only chance," argued Aggie."I'll have to do it now, before
Alfred gets back.""But Aggie," protested Zoie, clinging to her departing friend, "suppose
that crazy mother should come back?""Nonsense," replied Aggie, and before Zoie could actually realise what
was happening the bang of the outside door told her that she was alone.CHAPTER XXV

Wondering what new terrors awaited her, Zoie glanced uncertainly from
door to door.So strong had become her habit of taking refuge in the
bed, that unconsciously she backed toward it now.Barely had she reached
the centre of the room when a terrific crash of breaking glass from the
adjoining room sent her shrieking in terror over the footboard, and head
first under the covers.Here she would doubtless have remained until
suffocated, had not Jimmy in his backward flight from one of the
inner rooms overturned a large rocker.This additional shock to Zoie's
overstrung nerves forced a wild scream from her lips, and an answering
exclamation from the nerve-racked Jimmy made her sit bolt upright.She
gazed at him in astonishment.His tie was awry, one end of his collar
had taken leave of its anchorage beneath his stout chin, and was now
just tickling the edge of his red, perspiring brow.His hair was on end
and his feelings were undeniably ruffled.As usual Zoie's greeting did
not tend to conciliate him."The fire-escape," panted Jimmy and he nodded mysteriously toward the
inner rooms of the apartment.There was only one and that led through the
bathroom window.He was now peeping cautiously out of the
window toward the pavement below.Jimmy jerked his thumb in the direction of the street.Zoie gazed at him
with grave apprehension.Jimmy shook his head and continued to peer cautiously out of the window."What did _I_ do with her?"repeated Jimmy, a flash of his old
resentment returning.For the first time, Zoie became fully conscious of Jimmy's ludicrous
appearance.Her overstrained nerves gave way and she began to laugh
hysterically."Say," shouted Jimmy, towering over the bed and devoutly wishing that
she were his wife so that he might strike her with impunity."Don't you
sic any more lunatics onto me."It is doubtful whether Zoie's continued laughter might not have provoked
Jimmy to desperate measures, had not the 'phone at that moment directed
their thoughts toward worse possibilities.After the instrument had
continued to ring persistently for what seemed to Zoie an age, she
motioned to Jimmy to answer it.He responded by retreating to the other
side of the room."It may be Aggie," suggested Zoie.For the first time, Jimmy became aware that Aggie was nowhere in the
apartment.he exclaimed, as he realised that he was again tete-a-tete
with the terror of his dreams."Gone to do what YOU should have done," was Zoie's characteristic
answer."Well," answered Jimmy hotly, "it's about time that somebody besides me
did something around this place.""YOU," mocked Zoie, "all YOU'VE ever done was to hoodoo me from the very
beginning.""If you'd taken my advice," answered Jimmy, "and told your husband the
truth about the luncheon, there'd never have been any 'beginning.'""If, if, if," cried Zoie, in an agony of impatience, "if you'd tipped
that horrid old waiter enough, he'd never have told anyway.""I'm not buying waiters to cover up your crimes," announced Jimmy with
his most self-righteous air."You'll be buying more than that to cover up your OWN crimes before
you've finished," retorted Zoie."Before I've finished with YOU, yes," agreed Jimmy.He wheeled upon her
with increasing resentment."Do you know where I expect to end up?""I know where you OUGHT to end up," snapped Zoie."I'll finish in the electric chair," said Jimmy."I can feel blue
lightning chasing up and down my spine right now.""Well, I wish you HAD finished in the electric chair," declared Zoie,
"before you ever dragged me into that awful old restaurant."answered Jimmy shaking his fist at her across the
foot of the bed.For the want of adequate words to express his further
feelings, Jimmy was beginning to jibber, when the outer door was
heard to close, and he turned to behold Aggie entering hurriedly with
something partly concealed by her long cape."It's all right," explained Aggie triumphantly to Zoie.She threw her cape aside and disclosed the fruits of her conquest."So," snorted Jimmy in disgust, slightly miffed by the apparent ease
with which Aggie had accomplished a task about which he had made so much
ado, "you've gone into the business too, have you?"She continued in a businesslike tone to
Zoie."Thank Heaven," sighed Aggie, then she turned to Jimmy and addressed him
in rapid, decided tones."Now, dear," she said, "I'll just put the new
baby to bed, then I'll give you the other one and you can take it right
down to the mother."Jimmy made a vain start in the direction of the fire-escape.Four
detaining hands were laid upon him."Don't try anything like that," warned Aggie; "you can't get out of this
house without that baby.And Aggie sailed triumphantly out of the room to
make the proposed exchange of babies.Before Jimmy was able to suggest to himself an escape from Aggie's last
plan of action, the telephone again began to cry for attention.Neither Jimmy nor Zoie could summon courage to approach the impatient
instrument, and as usual Zoie cried frantically for Aggie.Aggie was not long in returning to the room and this time she bore in
her arms the infant so strenuously demanded by its mad mother."Here you are, Jimmy," she said; "here's the other one.Now take him
down stairs quickly before Alfred gets back."She attempted to place the
unresisting babe in Jimmy's chubby arms, but Jimmy's freedom was not to
be so easily disposed of.he exclaimed, backing away from the small creature in fear and
abhorrence, "take that bundle of rags down to the hotel office and have
that woman hystericing all over me."Oh well," answered Aggie, distracted by the persistent ringing of the
'phone, "then hold him a minute until I answer the 'phone."This at least was a compromise, and reluctantly Jimmy allowed the now
wailing infant to be placed in his arms."Jig it, Jimmy, jig it," cried Zoie.Jimmy looked down helplessly at
the baby's angry red face, but before he had made much headway with the
"jigging," Aggie returned to them, much excited by the message which she
had just received over the telephone."That mother is making a scene down stairs in the office," she said."You hear," chided Zoie, in a fury at Jimmy, "what did Aggie tell you?""If she wants this thing," maintained Jimmy, looking down at the bundle
in his arms, "she can come after it.""We can't have her up here," objected Aggie."Alfred may be back at any minute.You know what
happened the last time we tried to change them.""You can send it down the chimney, for all I care," concluded Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, her face suddenly illumined."Oh Lord," groaned Jimmy, who had come to regard any elation on Zoie's
or Aggie's part as a sure forewarner of ultimate discomfort for him.Again Aggie had recourse to the 'phone."Hello," she called to the office boy, "tell that woman to go around to
the back door, and we'll send something down to her."There was a slight
pause, then Aggie added sweetly, "Yes, tell her to wait at the foot of
the fire-escape."Zoie had already caught the drift of Aggie's intention and she now fixed
her glittering eyes upon Jimmy, who was already shifting about uneasily
and glancing at Aggie, who approached him with a business-like air."Now, dear," said Aggie, "come with me.I'll hand Baby out through the
bathroom window and you can run right down the fire-escape with him.""If I do run down the fire-escape," exclaimed Jimmy, wagging his large
head from side to side, "I'll keep right on RUNNING.That's the last
you'll ever see of me.""But, Jimmy," protested Aggie, slightly hurt by his threat, "once that
woman gets her baby you'll have no more trouble."asked Jimmy, looking from one to the other."She'll be up here if you don't hurry," urged Aggie impatiently, and
with that she pulled Jimmy toward the bedroom door."Let her come," said Jimmy, planting his feet so as to resist Aggie's
repeated tugs, "I'm going to South America.""Why will you act like this," cried Aggie, in utter desperation, "when
we have so little time?""Say," said Jimmy irrelevantly, "do you know that I haven't had any----"

"Yes," interrupted Aggie and Zoie in chorus, "we know.""How long," continued Zoie impatiently, "is it going to take you to slip
down that fire-escape?""That depends on how fast I'slip,'" answered Jimmy doggedly."You'll'slip' all right," sneered Zoie.Further exchange of pleasantries between these two antagonists was cut
short by the banging of the outside door.exclaimed Aggie, glancing nervously over her shoulder,
"there's Alfred now.Hurry, Jimmy, hurry," she cried, and with that she
fairly forced Jimmy out through the bedroom door, and followed in his
wake to see him safely down the fire-escape.CHAPTER XXVI

Zoie had barely time to arrange herself after the manner of an
interesting invalid, when Alfred entered the room in the gayest of
spirits."Hello, dearie," he cried as he crossed quickly to her side.asked Zoie faintly and she glanced uneasily toward the door,
through which Jimmy and Aggie had just disappeared."I told you I shouldn't be long," said Alfred jovially, and he implanted
a condescending kiss on her forehead.he
asked, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction."You're all cold," pouted Zoie, edging away, "and you've been drinking.""I had to have one or two with the boys," said Alfred, throwing out his
chest and strutting about the room, "but never again.From now on I cut
out all drinks and cigars.This is where I begin to live my life for our
sons."asked Zoie, as she began to see long years
of boredom stretching before her."You and our boys are one and the same, dear," answered Alfred, coming
back to her side."You mean you couldn't go on loving ME if it weren't for the BOYS?"She was beginning to realise how completely
her hold upon him depended upon her hideous deception."Of course I could, Zoie," answered Alfred, flattered by what he
considered her desire for his complete devotion, "but----"

"But not so MUCH," pouted Zoie."Well, of course, dear," admitted Alfred evasively, as he sank down upon
the edge of the bed by her side--

"You needn't say another word," interrupted Zoie, and then with a shade
of genuine repentance, she declared shame-facedly that she hadn't been
"much of a wife" to Alfred.contradicted the proud young father, "you've given me the
ONE thing that I wanted most in the world.""But you see, dear," said Zoie, as she wound her little white arms about
his neck, and looked up into his face adoringly, "YOU'VE been the 'ONE'
thing that I wanted 'MOST' and I never realised until to-night how--how
crazy you are about things.""Well," said Zoie, letting her eyes fall before his and picking at a bit
of imaginary lint on the coverlet, "babies and things.""Oh," said Alfred, and he was about to proceed when she again
interrupted him."But now that I DO realise it," continued Zoie, earnestly, her fingers
on his lips, lest he again interrupt, "if you'll only have a little
patience with me, I'll--I'll----" again her eyes fell bashfully to the
coverlet, as she considered the possibility of being ultimately obliged
to replace the bogus twins with real ones."All the patience in the world," answered Alfred, little dreaming of the
problem that confronted the contrite Zoie."That's all I ask," declared Zoie, her assurance completely restored,
"and in case anything SHOULD happen to THESE----" she glanced anxiously
toward the door through which Aggie had borne the twins."But nothing is going to happen to these, dear," interrupted Alfred,
rising and again assuming an air of fatherly protection.There, there," he added, patting her small shoulder and nodding
his head wisely."That crazy woman has got on your nerves, but you
needn't worry, I've got everything fixed.Donneghey sent a special
officer over with me.shrieked Zoie, fixing her eyes on the bedroom door, through which
Jimmy had lately disappeared and wondering whether he had yet "slipped"
down the fire-escape."Yes," continued Alfred, walking up and down the floor with a masterly
stride."If that woman is caught hanging around here again, she'll get a
little surprise.My boys are safe now, God bless them!"Then reminded of
the fact that he had not seen them since his return, he started quickly
toward the bedroom door."I'll just have a look at the little rascals,"
he decided.She caught Alfred's arm as he passed the side of
her bed, and clung to him in desperation.Alfred looked down at her in surprise.She turned her face toward the door, and called lustily, "Aggie!questioned Alfred, thinking Zoie suddenly ill, "can
I get you something?"Before Zoie was obliged to reply, Aggie answered her summons.she asked, glancing inquiringly into Zoie's distressed
face."Alfred's here," said Zoie, with a sickly smile as she stroked his hand
and glanced meaningly at Aggie.cried Aggie, and involuntarily she took a step backward,
as though to guard the bedroom door."Yes," said Alfred, mistaking Aggie's surprise for a compliment to his
resource; "and now, Aggie, if you'll just stay with Zoie for a minute
I'll have a look at my boys."exclaimed Aggie, nervously, and she placed herself again in
front of the bedroom door.Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air."I'll not WAKE them," persisted Alfred, "I just wish to have a LOOK at
them," and with that he again made a move toward the door."But Alfred," protested Zoie, still clinging to his hand, "you're not
going to leave me again--so soon."Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of
their persistent opposition, but before he could think of a polite way
of over-ruling them, Aggie continued persuasively."You stay with Zoie," she said."I'll bring the boys in here and you can
both have a look at them.""But Aggie," argued Alfred, puzzled by her illogical behaviour, "would
it be wise to wake them?""Now you stay here and I'll get them."Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door
had closed behind her, so he resigned himself to her decision, banished
his temporary annoyance at her obstinacy, and glanced about the room
with a new air of proprietorship."This is certainly a great night, Zoie," he said."It certainly is," acquiesced Zoie, with an over emphasis that made
Alfred turn to her with new concern."I'm afraid that mad woman made you very nervous, dear," he said.Zoie's nerves were destined to bear still further strain, for at that
moment, there came a sharp ring at the door.Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred, who had
advanced to soothe her, drew him down by her side and buried her head on
his breast."You ARE jumpy," said Alfred, and at that instant a wrangle of loud
voices, and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall.asked Alfred, endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoie's
frantic embrace.Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise, but his alert
ear caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute
in the hallway."That sounds like the officer," he exclaimed.cried Zoie, and she wound her arms more tightly about
him.CHAPTER XXVII

Propelled by a large red fist, attached to the back of his badly wilted
collar, the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer
door."Let go of me," shouted the hapless Jimmy.The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist; then a
large burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the
reluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him."I got him for you, sir," announced the officer proudly, to the
astonished Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to
struggle to his feet.Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to
the bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.He snatched the infant from the officer
and pressed him jealously to his breast."I don't understand," he said,
gazing at the officer in stupefaction.asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate
Jimmy."I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.""I KNEW it," exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at
Jimmy for his awkwardness.Alfred
turned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing
defiance into the officer's threatening eyes.What's the matter with you,
Jimmy?This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out
into the night.""Then you've had trouble with him before?"He
studied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought
a confirmed "baby-snatcher" to justice."I've had a little trouble myself," declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved
to make a clean breast of it."I'm not asking about your troubles," interrupted the officer savagely,
and Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on
his collar."Go ahead, sir," said the officer to Alfred."Well," began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, "he was out
with my boy when I arrived.I stopped him from going out with him
a second time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the
fire-escape.I don't know what to say," he finished weakly."_I_ do," exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high explosive,
"and I'll say it."And before Jimmy could get further,
Alfred resumed with fresh vehemence."He's supposed to be a friend of mine," he explained to the officer, as
he nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy."He was all right when I left him
a few months ago.""You'll think I'm all right again," shouted Jimmy, trying to get free
from the officer, "before I've finished telling all I----"

"That won't help any," interrupted the officer firmly, and with another
twist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most
civil manner, "What shall I do with him, sir?""I don't know," said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject
for a straight jacket."It's absurd," cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter
despair of ever disentangling the present complication without
ultimately losing Alfred, "you're all absurd," she cried wildly.exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, "what do you
mean?""It's a joke," said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke
lay."If you had any sense you could see it.""I DON'T see it," said Alfred, with hurt dignity."Neither do I," said Jimmy, with boiling resentment."Can you call it a joke," asked Alfred, incredulously, "to have our
boy----" He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion
piece to this youngster.he exclaimed, "our other
boy----" He rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified
face to Zoie."Now, Alfred," pleaded Zoie, "don't get excited; he's all right."Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as
usual he was the source of an inspiration for her."Jimmy never cared for the other one," she said, "did you, Jimmy?"Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command."Wait," he said,
then he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other
boy was quite safe.The picture that confronted him brought the hair
straight up on his head.True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's
return with the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to
appear on the threshold with one babe on each arm."Here they are," she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight
of the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied
hand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition,
"THOSE aren't MINE," he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.stammered Aggie for the want of something better
to say.Then he turned in appeal to his young wife,
whose face had now become utterly expressionless.There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and
she proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her."OURS, dear," she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and
feeling sure that his mind was about to give way."Why--why--why," stuttered Zoie, "THAT'S the JOKE."echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but
such."Yes," added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their
temporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future.stammered Alfred, "what IS there to tell?""Why, you see," said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each
elaboration of Zoie's lie, "we didn't dare to break it to you too
suddenly."gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on
his face."So," concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, "we
asked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT."Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction.Was it possible
that she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?"Yes," confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, "we wanted you to get used
to the idea gradually."He was afraid to allow his mind to accept
too suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy
over-power him."You--you--do--don't mean----" he stuttered."Yes, dear," sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a
languid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.cried Alfred, now delirious with delight."Give
them to me," he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants
savagely from her arms."Give me ALL of them, ALL of them."He clasped
the three babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the
unsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to
hers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her
unmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his
heart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind
in general.Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated
that bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss.A proceeding which
Jimmy did not at all approve.Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled
Jimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a
loud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young
friend.Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred
veered off in the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in
time to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young
father.Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred
suddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other."Well," said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air,
and feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his
short-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, "if this is all a
joke, I'll let the woman go.""The woman," repeated Alfred; "what woman?""I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape," explained the
officer.Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly."I thought
she might be an accomplice."His manner was
becoming more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of
each new infant."Don't be silly, Alfred," snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was
making such an idiot of himself."Oh, that's it," said Alfred, with a wise nod of comprehension; "the
nurse, then she's in the joke too?""You're all in it," he exclaimed, flattered to think
that they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many
of them to deceive him."Yes," assented Jimmy sadly, "we are all 'in it.'""Well, she's a great actress," decided Alfred, with the air of a
connoisseur."She sure is," admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt
his reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him."She put up a
phoney story about the kid being hers," he added."But I could tell she
wasn't on the level.Good-night, sir," he called to Alfred, and ignoring
Jimmy, he passed quickly from the room."Oh, officer," Alfred called after him.Daniel went back to the hallway.I'll
be down later and fix things up with you."Again Alfred gave his whole
attention to his new-found family.He leaned over the cradle and gazed
ecstatically into the three small faces below his."This is too much,"
he murmured."Much too much," agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the
couch in his customary attitude of gloom."You were right not to break it to me too suddenly," said Alfred, and
with his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch
by Jimmy's side."You're a cute one," he continued to Jimmy, who was
edging away from the three mites with aversion.In the absence of any
answer from Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, "Isn't he a cute one, dear?""Oh, yes, VERY," answered Zoie, sarcastically.Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at
self restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door."If you women are done with me," he said, "I'll clear out."exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself
between his old friend and the door."What a chance," and he laughed
boisterously."You're not going to get out of my sight this night," he
declared."I'm just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.""So am I," assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot
where his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted."A man needs someone around," he declared, "when he's going through a
thing like this.I need all of you, all of you," and with his eyes he
embraced the weary circle of faces about him."I feel as though I could
go out of my head," he explained and with that he began tucking the
three small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'

"You act as though you WERE out of your head," she commented, but Alfred
did not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing
three babies to sleep with one lullaby.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show
some resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again
simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII

Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,
Alfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into
the room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly
for the side of Zoie's bed."If you plaze, mum," she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her
hands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed."'Scuse me for comin' right in"--Maggie was breathing hard--"but me
mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from
work, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum."cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward
Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing
interest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, "your father is mad about babies?""It's all right, dear," interrupted Zoie nervously; "you see," she
went on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, "this is our
washerwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it
made the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.""Oh," said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so
easily disposed of."If you please, mum," she objected, "it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that
all his heirs were boys, "No wonder your pa's angry.Come now," he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and
regarding her indulgently, "you go straight home and tell your father
that what HE needs is BOYS.""Well, of course, sir," answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that
Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her
parents, "if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money
back," and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel
petticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, "what money?"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly."The money for the wash, dear," she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, "who talks
of money at such a time as this?"And taking a ten dollar bill from his
pocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying
to return to him the original purchase money."Here," he said to the
astonished girl, "you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to
him for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it."This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,
or at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was
adding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,
but she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such
a "grand 'hoigh" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no
doubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred
undecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand."I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir," she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her
red little fingers over the bill, "he's GOT to like it.Now you run along," he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her
toward the door, "and tell him what I say.""Yes, sir," murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly
under Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high
backed chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's
being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,
Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their
way with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into
space.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing
became laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of
Maggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the
side of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his
ear."Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,
sir."He studied the young person at his
elbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had
happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently
Maggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy
thought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand
fall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy
began to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the
harder."Go away," whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he
said, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,
Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the
prompt answer that came from her direction."The wash, dear," said Zoie to Alfred; "Jimmy had to go after the wash,"
and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to
stop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, "You needn't wait, Maggie; we
understand.""Sure, an' it's more 'an I do," answered Maggie, and shaking her head
sadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of
Maggie's inhuman parent."Just fancy," he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, "fancy
any man not liking to be the father of twins," and with that he again
bent over the cradle and surveyed its contents."Think, Jimmy," he said,
when he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, "just think
of the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.""And then think of the way _I_ feel," grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; "what have you to feel about?"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a
crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie."Sounded like breaking glass," said Alfred.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; "nonsense!Here," he said, turning to Jimmy, "you hold the boys and I'll go
see----" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust
upon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his
arms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,
strained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had
strode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked
at Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining
room.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy
began to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could
scarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the
bedroom door."She's come up the fire-escape," cried Aggie; "she's beating Alfred to
death."shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets."She's locking him in the bathroom," declared Aggie, and with that she
disappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of
Aggie."Wait a minute," called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find
a satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and
humanity."Eat 'em," was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her
negligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX

Now, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this
commotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which
had been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly
unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie."Oh, plaze, sir," she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward
the babes in Jimmy's arms, "me fadder's coming right behind me.He's
a-lookin' for you sir.""For me," murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth
seemed to be looking for HIM."Put 'em down, sir," cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,
"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to
turn."There," said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very
eyes."Of course," said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to
let the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that
disconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the
cradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He
looked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made
a determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head
through the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between
O'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided
to take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he
streaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that
he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of
the Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,
wavering as to which side to surrender himself.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself
on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the
railing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's
advice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted
into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,
trembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room."Lave go of me," cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a
vain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for
the bed."Ah," he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object
beneath the covers, "there you are, mum," and he shook his fist above
what he believed to be the cowardly Mrs."'Tis well ye may cover
up your head," said he, "for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,
but when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'
'em too.Then getting no response from the
agitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in
astonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but
three "barren.""They're child stalers, that's what they are," he declared to Maggie,
as he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast."Me
little Biddy," he crooned over his much coveted possession."Me little
Norah," he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his
narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled
his wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now
semi-quiet comforter."The black heart of ye, mum," he roared, then ordering Maggie to give
back "every penny of that shameless creetur's money" he turned toward
the door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in
his denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman
rushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,
she laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced
her.she asked, then peering into
the face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed
moan.She scanned the face of the second
infant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother
of the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the
cradle."I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there," he said.Then
bidding Maggie to "git along out o' this" and shrugging his shoulders
to convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept
quickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,
the Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when
Zoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother."How dare
you lock my husband in the bathroom?"She pointed to the key, which the
woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand."Give me that key," she
demanded, "give it to me this instant.""Take your horrid old key," said the mother, and she threw it on the
floor."If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in
JAIL," and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took
her welcome departure.Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had
just returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go
to the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the
bathroom door and demanding his instant release."I'll let him out," said Aggie."You get into bed," and she slipped
quickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet
and slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something
rough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing
against which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited
bed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room
emitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that
direction seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped
in the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague
feeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all
knowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion
was thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,
and swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the
upper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,
awaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal
had transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and
he had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the
time he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a
babel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his
shell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie
before her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that
the pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,
Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend."You imagined it, Zoie," she declared, "look for yourself."Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway."Well, perhaps I did," she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the
room, "my nerves are jumping like fizzy water."They were soon to "jump" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with
anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered
the room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who
had dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly
about the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly
acquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib."Not ALL of them," said Zoie."All," insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy
recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,
but what had become of the other two?"I don't know," said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that
night, "I left them with Jimmy."shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, "then he's at it again.And
with that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on
his face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and
patted her shoulder condescendingly."Control yourself, my dear," he said."Control yourself; I'll get
your babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then," he added with
parting emphasis from the doorway, "I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie
were engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By
uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action
for him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for
the details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was
well covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the
bedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly
beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws
wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful
creature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting
into Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX

Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie
was bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred
returned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were
three infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical
Italian woman, and last of all, Maggie."Bring them all in here, officer," called Alfred over his shoulder."I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are."Then turning to Aggie,
who stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,
"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.""She's fainted," said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young
wife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie
and began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within
him, "You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over
Zoie."Rouse yourself, my dear," he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up
indignation."I'll let you know when I want to hear from you," snarled the officer to
O'Flarety."But they're NOT her babies," protested the Italian woman desperately."Cut it," shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged
parents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she
regained her senses."Your babies are all right," he assured her."I've
brought them all back to you."gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been
intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking."Yes, dear," said Alfred, "every one," and he pointed toward the three
infants in the officer's arms.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.she moaned and again she swooned."I told you she'd be afraid to face us," shouted the now triumphant
O'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, "how dare you
persecute this poor demented mother?"Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful
Italian woman."She didn't persecute me, oh no!"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and
begged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers."Let's hear her SAY it," demanded O'Flarety."You SHALL hear her," answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned
to the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak."Sure," said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of
Zoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite
her own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, "take them
away!"This hateful reminder brought
Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife."The excitement has unnerved her," he said to the officer."Ain't you about done with my kids?"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any
man with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a
"good payin' job.""What do you want for your proof anyway?"But Alfred's
faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily
shaken."My wife is in no condition to be questioned," he declared."She's out
of her head, and if you don't----"

He stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a
second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant
Jimmy."I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,"
he called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a
ferocious expression."I caught him slipping down the fire-escape," explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach."Jimmy," said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes
upon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast
failing faculties, "you know the truth of this thing.You are the one
who sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a
father."asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected
spouse."Of course I am," replied Alfred, with every confidence, "but I have to
prove it to the officer.Then turning to
the uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, "Tell the
officer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am
I not?""If you're depending on ME for your future offspring," answered Jimmy,
wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, "you
are NOT a father."gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in
bewilderment."Ask them," answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie."My darling,"
he entreated, "rouse yourself.""Now," said
Alfred, with enforced self-control, "you must look the officer squarely
in the eye and tell him whose babies those are," and he nodded toward
the officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the
subject.cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead."I only borrowed them," said Zoie, "to get you home," and with that she
sank back on the couch and closed her eyes.cried the triumphant O'Flarety."I guess they're your'n all right," admitted the officer doggedly, and
he grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents."I guess they'd better be," shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian
woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist."If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'""On your way," commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together
with Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy
household.he exclaimed; then he turned to
Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: "If I'm not a
father, what am I?""I'd hate to tell you," was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter
dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his
hands."What shall I do with this one, sir?"asked the officer, undecided as to
Jimmy's exact standing in the household."Shoot him, for all I care," groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to
go."No more of your funny business," said the officer with a parting nod at
Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises
that Jimmy had left on his shins.said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face
against his round apoplectic cheek.And after all you
have done for us!""Yes," sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to
her feet, "he's done a lot, hasn't he?"And then forgetting that her
original adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous
results was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly,
"All this would never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his
horrid old luncheon."This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be
well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life.He turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was
now beginning to sit up and take notice.Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make
a clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most
ingratiating manner."Now, Alfred," she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about
his unsuspecting neck, "if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL
TRUTH."A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and
a determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily
interrupted Zoie's narrative.But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred
the real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another
day, she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment
was evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices,
up and down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter
of golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his
ample, well kept grounds.Captives under the wire dome, but desirous of escape,
Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes, Copres, Gymnopleuri, Sisyphi, all see about
them the freedom of space, the joys of the open sunlight; and not one
thinks of going round under the rampart, a front which would present no
difficulty to their pick-axes.Even in the higher ranks of animality, examples of similar mental
obfuscation are not lacking.Audubon relates how, in his days, the wild
Turkeys were caught in North America.In a clearing known to be frequented by these birds, a great cage was
constructed with stakes driven into the ground.In the centre of the
enclosure opened a short tunnel, which dipped under the palisade and
returned to the surface outside the cage by a gentle <DW72>, which was
open to the sky.The central opening, large enough to give a bird free
passage, occupied only a portion of the enclosure, leaving around it,
against the circle of stakes, a wide unbroken zone.A few handfuls of
maize were scattered in the interior of the trap, as well as round
about it, and in particular along the sloping path, which passed under
a sort of bridge and led to the centre of the contrivance.In short,
the Turkey-trap presented an ever-open door.The bird found it in order
to enter, but did not think of looking for it in order to return by it.According to the famous American ornithologist, the Turkeys, lured by
the grains of maize, descended the insidious <DW72>, entered the short
underground passage and beheld, at the end of it, plunder and the
light.A few steps farther and the gluttons emerged, one by one, from
beneath the bridge.The maize was abundant; and the Turkeys' crops grew swollen.When all was gathered, the band wished to retreat, but not one of the
prisoners paid any attention to the central hole by which he had
arrived.Gobbling uneasily, they passed again and again across the
bridge whose arch was yawning beside them; they circled round against
the palisade, treading a hundred times in their own footprints; they
thrust their necks, with their crimson wattles, through the bars; and
there, with beaks in the open air, they remained until they were
exhausted.Remember, inept fowl, the occurrences of a little while ago; think of
the tunnel which led you hither!If there be in that poor brain of
yours an atom of capacity, put two ideas together and remind yourself
that the passage by which you entered is there and open for your
escape!The light, an irresistible
attraction, holds you subjugated against the palisade; and the shadow
of the yawning pit, which has but lately permitted you to enter and
will quite as readily permit of your exit, leaves you indifferent.To
recognize the use of this opening you would have to reflect a little,
to evolve the past; but this tiny retrospective calculation is beyond
your powers.So the trapper, returning a few days later, will find a
rich booty, the entire flock imprisoned!Of poor intellectual repute, does the Turkey deserve his name for
stupidity?He does not appear to be more limited than another.Audubon
depicts him as endowed with certain useful ruses, in particular when he
has to baffle the attacks of his nocturnal enemy, the Virginian Owl.As
for his actions in the snare with the underground passage, any other
bird, impassioned of the light, would do the same.Under rather more difficult conditions, the Necrophorus repeats the
ineptness of the Turkey.When he wishes to return to the open daylight,
after resting in a short burrow against the rim of the wire cover, the
Beetle, seeing a little light filtering down through the loose soil,
reascends by the path of entry, incapable of telling himself that it
would suffice to prolong the tunnel as far in the opposite direction
for him to reach the outer world beyond the wall and gain his freedom.Here again is one in whom we shall seek in vain for any indication of
reflection.Like the rest, in spite of his legendary renown, he has no
guide but the unconscious promptings of instinct.To purge the earth of death's impurities and cause deceased animal
matter to be once more numbered among the treasures of life there are
hosts of sausage-queens, including, in our part of the world, the
Bluebottle (Calliphora vomitaria, Lin.)and the Grey Flesh-fly
(Sarcophaga carnaria, Lin.)Every one knows the first, the big,
dark-blue Fly who, after effecting her designs in the ill-watched
meat-safe, settles on our window-panes and keeps up a solemn buzzing,
anxious to be off in the sun and ripen a fresh emission of germs.How
does she lay her eggs, the origin of the loathsome maggot that battens
poisonously on our provisions whether of game or butcher's meat?What
are her stratagems and how can we foil them?This is what I propose to
investigate.The Bluebottle frequents our homes during autumn and a part of winter,
until the cold becomes severe; but her appearance in the fields dates
back much earlier.On the first fine day in February, we shall see her
warming herself, chillily, against the sunny walls.In April, I notice
her in considerable numbers on the laurustinus.It is here that she
seems to pair, while sipping the sugary exudations of the small white
flowers.The whole of the summer season is spent out of doors, in brief
flights from one refreshment-bar to the next.When autumn comes, with
its game, she makes her way into our houses and remains until the hard
frosts.This suits my stay-at-home habits and especially my legs, which are
bending under the weight of years.I need not run after the subjects of
my present study; they call on me.One and all bring me, in a little
screw of paper, the noisy visitor just captured against the panes.Thus do I fill my vivarium, which consists of a large, bell-shaped cage
of wire-gauze, standing in an earthenware pan full of sand.A mug
containing honey is the dining-room of the establishment.Here the
captives come to recruit themselves in their hours of leisure.To
occupy their maternal cares, I employ small birds--Chaffinches,
Linnets, Sparrows--brought down, in the enclosure, by my son's gun.I have just served up a Linnet shot two days ago.I next place in the
cage a Bluebottle, one only, to avoid confusion.Her fat belly
proclaims the advent of laying-time.An hour later, when the excitement
of being put in prison is allayed, my captive is in labour.With eager,
jerky steps, she explores the morsel of game, goes from the head to the
tail, returns from the tail to the head, repeats the action several
times and at last settles near an eye, a dimmed eye sunk into its
socket.The ovipositor bends at a right angle and dives into the junction of
the beak, straight down to the root.Then the eggs are emitted for
nearly half an hour.The layer, utterly absorbed in her serious
business, remains stationary and impassive and is easily observed
through my lens.A movement on my part would doubtless scare her; but
my restful presence gives her no anxiety.The discharge does not go on continuously until the ovaries are
exhausted; it is intermittent and performed in so many packets.Several
times over, the Fly leaves the bird's beak and comes to take a rest
upon the wire-gauze, where she brushes her hind-legs one against the
other.In particular, before using it again, she cleans, smooths and
polishes her laying-tool, the probe that places the eggs.Then, feeling
her womb still teeming, she returns to the same spot at the joint of
the beak.The delivery is resumed, to cease presently and then begin
anew.A couple of hours are thus spent in alternate standing near the
eye and resting on the wire-gauze.The Fly does not go back to the bird, a proof that
her ovaries are exhausted.The eggs are
dabbed in a continuous layer, at the entrance to the throat, at the
root of the tongue, on the membrane of the palate.Their number appears
considerable; the whole inside of the gullet is white with them.I fix
a little wooden prop between the two mandibles of the beak, to keep
them open and enable me to see what happens.I learn in this way that the hatching takes place in a couple of days.As soon as they are born, the young vermin, a swarming mass, leave the
place where they are and disappear down the throat.The beak of the bird invaded was closed at the start, as far as the
natural contact of the mandibles allowed.There remained a narrow slit
at the base, sufficient at most to admit the passage of a horse-hair.It was through this that the laying was performed.Lengthening her
ovipositor like a telescope, the mother inserted the point of her
implement, a point slightly hardened with a horny armour.The fineness
of the probe equals the fineness of the aperture.But, if the beak were
entirely closed, where would the eggs be laid then?With a tied thread I keep the two mandibles in absolute contact; and I
place a second Bluebottle in the presence of the Linnet, whom the
colonists have already entered by the beak.This time the laying takes
place on one of the eyes, between the lid and the eyeball.At the
hatching, which again occurs a couple of days later, the grubs make
their way into the fleshy depths of the socket.The eyes and the beak,
therefore, form the two chief entrances into feathered game.There are others; and these are the wounds.I cover the Linnet's head
with a paper hood which will prevent invasion through the beak and
eyes.I serve it, under the wire-gauze bell, to a third egg-layer.The
bird has been struck by a shot in the breast, but the sore is not
bleeding: no outer stain marks the injured spot.Moreover, I am careful
to arrange the feathers, to smooth them with a hair-pencil, so that the
bird looks quite smart and has every appearance of being untouched.She inspects the Linnet from end to end; with
her front tarsi she fumbles at the breast and belly.It is a sort of
auscultation by sense of touch.The insect becomes aware of what is
under the feathers by the manner in which these react.If scent lends
its assistance, it can only be very slightly, for the game is not yet
high.No drop of blood is near it, for it is
closed by a plug of down rammed into it by the shot.The Fly takes up
her position without separating the feathers or uncovering the wound.She remains here for two hours without stirring, motionless, with her
abdomen concealed beneath the plumage.My eager curiosity does not
distract her from her business for a moment.When she has finished, I take her place.There is nothing either on the
skin or at the mouth of the wound.I have to withdraw the downy plug
and dig to some depth before discovering the eggs.The ovipositor has
therefore lengthened its extensible tube and pushed beyond the feather
stopper driven in by the lead.The eggs are in one packet; they number
about three hundred.When the beak and eyes are rendered inaccessible, when the body,
moreover, has no wounds, the laying still takes place, but this time in
a hesitating and niggardly fashion.I pluck the bird completely, the
better to watch what happens; also, I cover the head with a paper hood
to close the usual means of access.For a long time, with jerky steps,
the mother explores the body in every direction; she takes her stand by
preference on the head, which she sounds by tapping on it with her
front tarsi.She knows that the openings which she needs are there,
under the paper; but she also knows how frail are her grubs, how
powerless to pierce their way through the strange obstacle which stops
her as well and interferes with the work of her ovipositor.The cowl
inspires her with profound distrust.Despite the tempting bait of the
veiled head, not an egg is laid on the wrapper, slight though it may
be.Weary of vain attempts to compass this obstacle, the Fly at last
decides in favour of other points, but not on the breast, belly, or
back, where the hide would seem too tough and the light too intrusive.She needs dark hiding-places, corners where the skin is very delicate.The spots chosen are the cavity of the axilla, corresponding with our
arm-pit, and the crease where the thigh joins the belly.Eggs are laid
in both places, but not many, showing that the groin and the axilla are
adopted only reluctantly and for lack of a better spot.With an unplucked bird, also hooded, the same experiment failed: the
feathers prevent the Fly from slipping into those deep places.Let us
add, in conclusion, that, on a skinned bird, or simply on a piece of
butcher's meat, the laying is effected on any part whatever, provided
that it be dark.It follows from all this that, to lay her eggs, the Bluebottle picks
out either naked wounds or else the mucous membranes of the mouth or
eyes, which are not protected by a skin of any thickness.The perfect efficiency of the paper bag, which prevents the inroads of
the worms through the eye-sockets or the beak, suggests a similar
experiment with the whole bird.It is a matter of wrapping the body in
a sort of artificial skin which will be as discouraging to the Fly as
the natural skin.Linnets, some with deep wounds, others almost intact,
are placed one by one in paper envelopes similar to those in which the
nursery-gardener keeps his seeds, envelopes just folded, without being
stuck.The paper is quite ordinary and of middling thickness.Torn
pieces of newspaper serve the purpose.These sheaths with the corpses inside them are freely exposed to the
air, on the table in my study, where they are visited, according to the
time of day, in dense shade and in bright sunlight.Attracted by the
effluvia from the dead meat, the Bluebottles haunt my laboratory, the
windows of which are always open.I see them daily alighting on the
envelopes and very busily exploring them, apprised of the contents by
the gamy smell.Their incessant coming and going is a sign of intense
cupidity; and yet none of them decides to lay on the bags.They do not
even attempt to slide their ovipositor through the slits of the folds.The favourable season passes and not an egg is laid on the tempting
wrappers.All the mothers abstain, judging the slender obstacle of the
paper to be more than the vermin will be able to overcome.This caution on the Fly's part does not at all surprise me: motherhood
everywhere has great gleams of perspicacity.What does astonish me is
the following result.The parcels containing the Linnets are left for a
whole year uncovered on the table; they remain there for a second year
and a third.The little birds
are intact, with unrumpled feathers, free from smell, dry and light,
like mummies.They have become not decomposed, but mummified.I expected to see them putrefying, running into sanies, like corpses
left to rot in the open air.On the contrary, the birds have dried and
hardened, without undergoing any change.What did they want for their
putrefaction?The maggot,
therefore, is the primary cause of dissolution after death; it is,
above all, the putrefactive chemist.A conclusion not devoid of value may be drawn from my paper game-bags.In our markets, especially in those of the South, the game is hung
unprotected from the hooks on the stalls.Larks strung up by the dozen
with a wire through their nostrils, Thrushes, Plovers, Teal,
Partridges, Snipe, in short, all the glories of the spit which the
autumn migration brings us, remain for days and weeks at the mercy of
the Flies.The buyer allows himself to be tempted by a goodly exterior;
he makes his purchase and, back at home, just when the bird is being
prepared for roasting, he discovers that the promised dainty is alive
with worms.There is nothing for it but to throw the
loathsome, verminous thing away.Everybody knows it, and nobody
thinks seriously of shaking off her tyranny: not the retailer, nor the
wholesale dealer, nor the killer of the game.What is wanted to keep
the maggots out?Hardly anything: to slip each bird into a paper
sheath.If this precaution were taken at the start, before the Flies
arrive, any game would be safe and could be left indefinitely to attain
the degree of ripeness required by the epicure's palate.Stuffed with olives and myrtleberries, the Corsican Blackbirds are
exquisite eating.We sometimes receive them at Orange, layers of them,
packed in baskets through which the air circulates freely and each
contained in a paper wrapper.They are in a state of perfect
preservation, complying with the most exacting demands of the kitchen.I congratulate the nameless shipper who conceived the bright idea of
clothing his Blackbirds in paper.There is, of course, a serious objection to this method of
preservation.In its paper shroud, the article is invisible; it is not
enticing; it does not inform the passer-by of its nature and qualities.There is one resource left which would leave the bird uncovered: simply
to case the head in a paper cap.The head being the part most menaced,
because of the mucous membrane of the throat and eyes, it would be
enough, as a rule, to protect the head, in order to keep off the Flies
and thwart their attempts.Let us continue to study the Bluebottle, while varying our means of
information.A tin, about four inches deep, contains a piece of
butcher's meat.The lid is not put in quite straight and leaves a
narrow slit at one point of its circumference, allowing, at most, of
the passage of a fine needle.When the bait begins to give off a gamy
scent, the mothers come, singly or in numbers.They are attracted by
the odour which, transmitted through a thin crevice, hardly reaches my
nostrils.They explore the metal receptacle for some time, seeking an entrance.Finding naught that enables them to reach the coveted morsel, they
decide to lay their eggs on the tin, just beside the aperture.Sometimes, when the width of the passage allows of it, they insert the
ovipositor into the tin and lay the eggs inside, on the very edge of
the slit.Whether outside or in, the eggs are dabbed down in a fairly
regular and absolutely white layer.We have seen the Bluebottle refusing to lay her eggs on the paper bag,
notwithstanding the carrion fumes of the Linnet enclosed; yet now,
without hesitation, she lays them on a sheet of metal.Can the nature
of the floor make any difference to her?I replace the tin lid by a
paper cover stretched and pasted over the orifice.With the point of my
knife I make a narrow slit in this new lid.That is quite enough: the
parent accepts the paper.What determined her, therefore, is not simply the smell, which can
easily be perceived even through the uncut paper, but, above all, the
crevice, which will provide an entrance for the vermin, hatched
outside, near the narrow passage.The maggots' mother has her own
logic, her prudent foresight.She knows how feeble her wee grubs will
be, how powerless to cut their way through an obstacle of any
resistance; and so, despite the temptation of the smell, she refrains
from laying, so long as she finds no entrance through which the
new-born worms can slip unaided.I wanted to know whether the colour, the shininess, the degree of
hardness and other qualities of the obstacle would influence the
decision of a mother obliged to lay her eggs under exceptional
conditions.With this object in view, I employed small jars, each
baited with a bit of butcher's meat.The respective lids were made of
different- paper, of oil-skin, or of some of that tin-foil,
with its gold or coppery sheen, which is used for sealing
liqueur-bottles.On not one of these covers did the mothers stop, with
any desire to deposit their eggs; but, from the moment that the knife
had made the narrow slit, all the lids were, sooner or later, visited
and all, sooner or later, received the white shower somewhere near the
gash.The look of the obstacle, therefore, does not count; dull or
brilliant, drab or : these are details of no importance; the
thing that matters is that there should be a passage to allow the grubs
to enter.Though hatched outside, at a distance from the coveted morsel, the
new-born worms are well able to find their refectory.As they release
themselves from the egg, without hesitation, so accurate is their
scent, they slip beneath the edge of the ill-joined lid, or through the
passage cut by the knife.Behold them entering upon their promised
land, their reeking paradise.Eager to arrive, do they drop from the top of the wall?Slowly creeping, they make their way down the side of the jar; they use
their fore-part, ever in quest of information, as a crutch and grapnel
in one.They reach the meat and at once instal themselves upon it.Let us continue our investigation, varying the conditions.A large
test-tube, measuring nine inches high, is baited at the bottom with a
lump of butcher's meat.It is closed with wire-gauze, whose meshes, two
millimetres wide (.078 inch.--Translator's Note.), do not permit of the
Fly's passage.The Bluebottle comes to my apparatus, guided by scent
rather than sight.She hastens to the test-tube, whose contents are
veiled under an opaque cover, with the same alacrity as to the open
tube.The invisible attracts her quite as much as the visible.She stays awhile on the lattice of the mouth, inspects it attentively;
but, whether because circumstances failed to serve me, or because the
wire network inspired her with distrust, I never saw her dab her eggs
upon it for certain.As her evidence was doubtful, I had recourse to
the Flesh-fly (Sarcophaga carnaria).This Fly is less finicking in her preparations, she has more faith in
the strength of her worms, which are born ready-formed and vigorous,
and easily shows me what I wish to see.She explores the trellis-work,
chooses a mesh through which she inserts the tip of her abdomen, and,
undisturbed by my presence, emits, one after the other, a certain
number of grubs, about ten or so.True, her visits will be repeated,
increasing the family at a rate of which I am ignorant.The new-born worms, thanks to a slight viscidity, cling for a moment to
the wire-gauze; they swarm, wriggle, release themselves and leap into
the chasm.It is a nine-inch drop at least.When this is done, the
mother makes off, knowing for a certainty that her offspring will shift
for themselves.If they fall on the meat, well and good; if they fall
elsewhere, they can reach the morsel by crawling.This confidence in the unknown factor of the precipice, with no
indication but that of smell, deserves fuller investigation.From what
height will the Flesh-fly dare to let her children drop?I top the
test-tube with another tube, the width of the neck of a claret-bottle.The mouth is closed either with wire-gauze or with a paper cover with a
slight cut in it.Altogether, the apparatus measures twenty-five inches
in height.No matter: the fall is not serious for the lithe backs of
the young grubs; and, in a few days, the test-tube is filled with
larvae, in which it is easy to recognize the Flesh-fly's family by the
fringed coronet that opens and shuts at the maggot's stern like the
petals of a little flower.I did not see the mother operating: I was
not there at the time; but there is no doubt possible of her coming,
nor of the great dive taken by the family: the contents of the
test-tube furnish me with a duly authenticated certificate.I admire the leap and, to obtain one better still, I replace the tube
by another, so that the apparatus now stands forty-six inches high.The
column is erected at a spot frequented by Flies, in a dim light.Its
mouth, closed with a wire-gauze cover, reaches the level of various
other appliances, test-tubes and jars, which are already stocked or
awaiting their colony of vermin.When the position is well-known to the
Flies, I remove the other tubes and leave the column, lest the visitors
should turn aside to easier ground.From time to time the Bluebottle and the Flesh-fly perch on the
trellis-work, make a short investigation and then decamp.Throughout
the summer season, for three whole months, the apparatus remains where
it is, without result: never a worm.Does the
stench of the meat not spread, coming from that depth?Certainly it
spreads: it is unmistakable to my dulled nostrils and still more so to
the nostrils of my children, whom I call to bear witness.Then why does
the Flesh-fly, who but now was dropping her grubs from a goodly height,
refuse to let them fall from the top of a column twice as high?Does
she fear lest her worms should be bruised by an excessive drop?There
is nothing about her to point to anxiety aroused by the length of the
shaft.I never see her explore the tube or take its size.She stands on
the trellised orifice; and there the matter ends.Can she be apprised
of the depth of the chasm by the comparative faintness of the offensive
odours that arise from it?Can the sense of smell measure the distance
and judge whether it be acceptable or not?The fact remains that, despite the attraction of the scent, the
Flesh-fly does not expose her worms to disproportionate falls.Can she
know beforehand that, when the chrysalids break, her winged family,
knocking with a sudden flight against the sides of a tall chimney, will
be unable to get out?This foresight would be in agreement with the
rules which order maternal instinct according to future needs.But, when the fall does not exceed a certain depth, the budding worms
of the Flesh-fly are dropped without a qualm, as all our experiments
show.This principle has a practical application which is not without
its value in matters of domestic economy.It is as well that the
wonders of entomology should sometimes give us a hint of commonplace
utility.The usual meat-safe is a sort of large cage with a top and bottom of
wood and four wire-gauze sides.Hooks fixed into the top are used
whereby to hang pieces which we wish to protect from the Flies.Often,
so as to employ the space to the best advantage, these pieces are
simply laid on the floor of the cage.With these arrangements, are we
sure of warding off the Fly and her vermin?We may protect ourselves against the Bluebottle, who is not
much inclined to lay her eggs at a distance from the meat; but there is
still the Flesh-fly, who is more venturesome and goes more briskly to
work and who will slip the grubs through a hole in the meshes and drop
them inside the safe.Agile as they are and well able to crawl, the
worms will easily reach anything on the floor; the only things secure
from their attacks will be the pieces hanging from the ceiling.It is
not in the nature of maggots to explore the heights, especially if this
implies climbing down a string in addition.People also use wire-gauze dish-covers.The trellised dome protects the
contents even less than does the meat-safe.The Flesh-fly takes no heed
of it.She can drop her worms through the meshes on the covered joint.We need only wrap the
birds which we wish to preserve--Thrushes, Partridges, Snipe and so
on--in separate paper envelopes; and the same with our beef and mutton.This defensive armour alone, while leaving ample room for the air to
circulate, makes any invasion by the worms impossible; even without a
cover or a meat-safe: not that paper possesses any special preservative
virtues, but solely because it forms an impenetrable barrier.The
Bluebottle carefully refrains from laying her eggs upon it and the
Flesh-fly from bringing forth her offspring, both of them knowing that
their new-born young are incapable of piercing the obstacle.Paper is equally successful in our strife against the Moths, those
plagues of our furs and clothes.To keep away these wholesale ravagers,
people generally use camphor, naphthalene, tobacco, bunches of
lavender, and other strong-scented remedies.Without wishing to malign
those preservatives, we are bound to admit that the means employed are
none too effective.The smell does very little to prevent the havoc of
the Moths.I would therefore advise our housewives, instead of all this chemist's
stuff, to use newspapers of a suitable shape and size.Take whatever
you wish to protect--your furs, your flannel, or your clothes--and pack
each article carefully in a newspaper, joining the edges with a double
fold, well pinned.If this joining is properly done, the Moth will
never get inside.Since my advice has been taken and this method
employed in my household, the old damage has no longer been repeated.A piece of meat is hidden in a jar under a layer
of fine, dry sand, a finger's-breadth thick.The jar has a wide mouth
and is left quite open.Let whoso come that will, attracted by the
smell.The Bluebottles are not long in inspecting what I have prepared
for them: they enter the jar, go out and come back again, inquiring
into the invisible thing revealed by its fragrance.A diligent watch
enables me to see them fussing about, exploring the sandy expanse,
tapping it with their feet, sounding it with their proboscis.I leave
the visitors undisturbed for a fortnight or three weeks.This is a repetition of what the paper bag, with its dead bird, showed
me.The Flies refuse to lay on the sand, apparently for the same
reasons.The paper was considered an obstacle which the frail vermin
would not be able to overcome.Its
grittiness would hurt the new-born weaklings, its dryness would absorb
the moisture indispensable to their movements.Later, when preparing
for the metamorphosis, when their strength has come to them, the grubs
will dig the earth quite well and be able to descend: but, at the
start, that would be very dangerous for them.Knowing these
difficulties, the mothers, however greatly tempted by the smell,
abstain from breeding.As a matter of fact, after long waiting, fearing
lest some packets of eggs may have escaped my attention, I inspect the
contents of the jar from top to bottom.Meat and sand contain neither
larvae nor pupae: the whole is absolutely deserted.The layer of sand being only a finger's-breadth thick, this experiment
requires certain precautions.The meat may expand a little, in going
bad, and protrude in one or two places.However small the fleshy eyots
that show above the surface, the Flies come to them and breed.Sometimes also the juices oozing from the putrid meat soak a small
extent of the sandy floor.That is enough for the maggot's first
establishment.These causes of failure are avoided with a layer of sand
about an inch thick.Then the Bluebottle, the Flesh-fly, and other
Flies whose grubs batten on dead bodies are kept at a proper distance.In the hope of awakening us to a proper sense of our insignificance,
pulpit orators sometimes make an unfair use of the grave and its worms.Let us put no faith in their doleful rhetoric.The chemistry of man's
final dissolution is eloquent enough of our emptiness: there is no need
to add imaginary horrors.The worm of the sepulchre is an invention of
cantankerous minds, incapable of seeing things as they are.Covered by
but a few inches of earth, the dead can sleep their quiet sleep: no Fly
will ever come to take advantage of them.At the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous invasion is
possible; aye, it is the invariable rule.For the melting down and
remoulding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than the
lowest of the brutes.Then the Fly exercises her rights and deals with
us as she does with any ordinary animal refuse.Nature treats us with
magnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed in
her crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are 1 and all alike.There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours:
equality in the presence of the maggot.Drover Dingdong's Sheep followed the Ram which Panurge had maliciously
thrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea, one after the other,
"for you know," says Rabelais, "it is the nature of the sheep always to
follow the first, wheresoever it goes."The Pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike, not from foolishness, but
from necessity: where the first goes all the others go, in a regular
string, with not an empty space between them.They proceed in single file, in a continuous row, each touching with
its head the rear of the one in front of it.The complex twists and
turns described in his vagaries by the caterpillar leading the van are
scrupulously described by all the others.No Greek theoria winding its
way to the Eleusinian festivals was ever more orderly.Hence the name
of Processionary given to the gnawer of the pine.His character is complete when we add that he is a rope-dancer all his
life long: he walks only on the tight-rope, a silken rail placed in
position as he advances.The caterpillar who chances to be at the head
of the procession dribbles his thread without ceasing and fixes it on
the path which his fickle preferences cause him to take.The thread is
so tiny that the eye, though armed with a magnifying-glass, suspects it
rather than sees it.But a second caterpillar steps on the slender foot-board and doubles it
with his thread; a third trebles it; and all the others, however many
there be, add the sticky spray from their spinnerets, so much so that,
when the procession has marched by, there remains, as a record of its
passing, a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmers in the
sun.Very much more sumptuous than ours, their system of road-making
consists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing.We sprinkle
our roads with broken stones and level them by the pressure of a heavy
steam-roller; they lay over their paths a soft satin rail, a work of
general interest to which each contributes his thread.Could they not, like other
caterpillars, walk about without these costly preparations?I see two
reasons for their mode of progression.It is night when the
Processionaries sally forth to browse upon the pine-leaves.They leave
their nest, situated at the top of a bough, in profound darkness; they
go down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that has
not yet been gnawed, a branch which becomes lower and lower by degrees
as the consumers finish stripping the upper storeys; they climb up this
untouched branch and spread over the green needles.When they have had their suppers and begin to feel the keen night air,
the next thing is to return to the shelter of the house.Measured in a
straight line, the distance is not great, hardly an arm's length; but
it cannot be covered in this way on foot.The caterpillars have to
climb down from one crossing to the next, from the needle to the twig,
from the twig to the branch, from the branch to the bough and from the
bough, by a no less angular path, to go back home.It is useless to
rely upon sight as a guide on this long and erratic journey.The
Processionary, it is true, has five ocular specks on either side of his
head, but they are so infinitesimal, so difficult to make out through
the magnifying-glass, that we cannot attribute to them any great power
of vision.Besides, what good would those short-sighted lenses be in
the absence of light, in black darkness?It is equally useless to think of the sense of smell.Has the
Processional any olfactory powers or has he not?Without
giving a positive answer to the question, I can at least declare that
his sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him
find his way.This is proved, in my experiments, by a number of hungry
caterpillars that, after a long fast, pass close beside a pine-branch
without betraying any eagerness of showing a sign of stopping.It is
the sense of touch that tells them where they are.So long as their
lips do not chance to light upon the pasture-land, not one of them
settles there, though he be ravenous.They do not hasten to food which
they have scented from afar; they stop at a branch which they encounter
on their way.Apart from sight and smell, what remains to guide them in returning to
the nest?In the Cretan labyrinth, Theseus
would have been lost but for the clue of thread with which Ariadne
supplied him.The spreading maze of the pine-needles is, especially at
night, as inextricable a labyrinth as that constructed for Minos.The
Processionary finds his way through it, without the possibility of a
mistake, by the aid of his bit of silk.At the time for going home,
each easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the
neighbouring threads, spread fanwise by the diverging herd; one by one
the scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon, which started from
the nest; and the sated caravan finds its way back to the manor with
absolute certainty.Longer expeditions are made in the daytime, even in winter, if the
weather be fine.Our caterpillars then come down from the tree, venture
on the ground, march in procession for a distance of thirty yards or
so.The object of these sallies is not to look for food, for the native
pine-tree is far from being exhausted: the shorn branches hardly count
amid the vast leafage.Moreover, the caterpillars observe complete
abstinence till nightfall.The trippers have no other object than a
constitutional, a pilgrimage to the outskirts to see what these are
like, possibly an inspection of the locality where, later on, they mean
to bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis.It goes without saying that, in these greater evolutions, the guiding
cord is not neglected.All
contribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets, as is the
invariable rule whenever there is a progression.Not one takes a step
forward without fixing to the path the thread from his lips.If the series forming the procession be at all long, the ribbon is
dilated sufficiently to make it easy to find; nevertheless, on the
homeward journey, it is not picked up without some hesitation.For
observe that the caterpillars when on the march never turn completely;
to wheel round on their tight-rope is a method utterly unknown to them.In order therefore to regain the road already covered, they have to
describe a zigzag whose windings and extent are determined by the
leader's fancy.Hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes
prolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of
doors.They collect into a motionless
cluster.To-morrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or
later be successful.Oftener still the winding curve meets the
guide-thread at the first attempt.As soon as the first caterpillar has
the rail between his legs, all hesitation ceases; and the band makes
for the nest with hurried steps.The use of this silk-tapestried roadway is evident from a second point
of view.To protect himself against the severity of the winter which he
has to face when working, the Pine Caterpillar weaves himself a shelter
in which he spends his bad hours, his days of enforced idleness.Alone,
with none but the meagre resources of his silk-glands, he would find
difficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the
winds.A substantial dwelling, proof against snow, gales and icy fogs,
requires the cooperation of a large number.Out of the individual's
piled-up atoms, the community obtains a spacious and durable
establishment.Every evening, when the
weather permits, the building has to be strengthened and enlarged.It
is indispensable, therefore, that the corporation of workers should not
be dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insects are
still in the caterpillar stage.But, without special arrangements, each
nocturnal expedition at grazing-time would be a cause of separation.At
that moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism.The caterpillars become more or less scattered, settling singly on the
branches around; each browses his pine-needle separately.How are they
to find one another afterwards and become a community again?The several threads left on the road make this easy.With that guide,
every caterpillar, however far he may be, comes back to his companions
without ever missing the way.They come hurrying from a host of twigs,
from here, from there, from above, from below; and soon the scattered
legion reforms into a group.The silk thread is something more than a
road-making expedient: it is the social bond, the system that keeps the
members of the brotherhood indissolubly united.At the head of every procession, long or short, goes a first
caterpillar whom I will call the leader of the march or file, though
the word leader, which I use for the want of a better, is a little out
of place here.Nothing, in fact, distinguishes this caterpillar from
the others: it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line
up; and mere chance brings him to the front.Among the Processionaries,
every captain is an officer of fortune.The actual leader leads;
presently he will be a subaltern, if the line should break up in
consequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order.His temporary functions give him an attitude of his own.While the
others follow passively in a close file, he, the captain, tosses
himself about and with an abrupt movement flings the front of his body
hither and thither.As he marches ahead he seems to be seeking his way.Does he in point of fact explore the country?Does he choose the most
practicable places?Or are his hesitations merely the result of the
absence of a guiding thread on ground that has not yet been covered?His subordinates follow very placidly, reassured by the cord which they
hold between their legs; he, deprived of that support, is uneasy.Why cannot I read what passes under his black, shiny skull, so like a
drop of tar to look at?To judge by actions, there is here a modicum of
discernment which is able, after experimenting, to recognize excessive
roughnesses, over-slippery surfaces, dusty places that offer no
resistance and, above all, the threads left by other excursionists.This is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the
Processionaries has taught me as to their mentality.Poor brains,
indeed; poor creatures, whose commonwealth has its safety hanging upon
a thread!The finest that I have seen
manoeuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yards and
numbered about three hundred caterpillars, drawn up with absolute
precision in a wavy line.But, if there were only two in a row the
order would still be perfect: the second touches and follows the first.By February I have processions of all lengths in the greenhouse.What
tricks can I play upon them?I see only two: to do away with the
leader; and to cut the thread.The suppression of the leader of the file produces nothing striking.If
the thing is done without creating a disturbance, the procession does
not alter its ways at all.The second caterpillar, promoted to captain,
knows the duties of his rank off-hand: he selects and leads, or rather
he hesitates and gropes.The breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either.I remove
a caterpillar from the middle of the file.With my scissors, so as not
to cause a commotion in the ranks, I cut the piece of ribbon on which
he stood and clear away every thread of it.As a result of this breach,
the procession acquires two marching leaders, each independent of the
other.It may be that the one in the rear joins the file ahead of him,
from which he is separated by but a slender interval; in that case,
things return to their original condition.More frequently, the two
parts do not become reunited.In that case, we have two distinct
processions, each of which wanders where it pleases and diverges from
the other.Nevertheless, both will be able to return to the nest by
discovering sooner or later, in the course of their peregrinations, the
ribbon on the other side of the break.I have thought
out another, one more fertile in possibilities.I propose to make the
caterpillars describe a close circuit, after the ribbons running from
it and liable to bring about a change of direction have been destroyed.The locomotive engine pursues its invariable course so long as it is
not shunted on to a branch-line.If the Processionaries find the silken
rail always clear in front of them, with no switches anywhere, will
they continue on the same track, will they persist in following a road
that never comes to an end?What we have to do is to produce this
circuit, which is unknown under ordinary conditions, by artificial
means.The first idea that suggests itself is to seize with the forceps the
silk ribbon at the back of the train, to bend it without shaking it and
to bring the end of it ahead of the file.If the caterpillar marching
in the van steps upon it, the thing is done: the others will follow him
faithfully.The operation is very simple in theory but most difficult
in practice and produces no useful results.The ribbon, which is
extremely slight, breaks under the weight of the grains of sand that
stick to it and are lifted with it.If it does not break, the
caterpillars at the back, however delicately we may go to work, feel a
disturbance which makes them curl up or even let go.There is a yet greater difficulty: the leader refuses the ribbon laid
before him; the cut end makes him distrustful.Failing to see the
regular, uninterrupted road, he slants off to the right or left, he
escapes at a tangent.If I try to interfere and to bring him back to
the path of my choosing, he persists in his refusal, shrivels up, does
not budge, and soon the whole procession is in confusion.We will not
insist: the method is a poor one, very wasteful of effort for at best a
problematical success.We ought to interfere as little as possible and obtain a natural closed
circuit.It lies in our power, without the least
meddling, to see a procession march along a perfect circular track.I
owe this result, which is eminently deserving of our attention, to pure
chance.On the shelf with the layer of sand in which the nests are planted
stand some big palm-vases measuring nearly a yard and a half in
circumference at the top.The caterpillars often scale the sides and
climb up to the moulding which forms a cornice around the opening.This
place suits them for their processions, perhaps because of the absolute
firmness of the surface, where there is no fear of landslides, as on
the loose, sandy soil below; and also, perhaps, because of the
horizontal position, which is favourable to repose after the fatigue of
the ascent.It provides me with a circular track all ready-made.I have
nothing to do but wait for an occasion propitious to my plans.This
occasion is not long in coming.On the 30th of January, 1896, a little before twelve o'clock in the
day, I discover a numerous troop making their way up and gradually
reaching the popular cornice.Slowly, in single file, the caterpillars
climb the great vase, mount the ledge and advance in regular
procession, while others are constantly arriving and continuing the
series.I wait for the string to close up, that is to say, for the
leader, who keeps following the circular moulding, to return to the
point from which he started.My object is achieved in a quarter of an
hour.The closed circuit is realized magnificently, in something very
nearly approaching a circle.The next thing is to get rid of the rest of the ascending column, which
would disturb the fine order of the procession by an excess of
newcomers; it is also important that we should do away with all the
silken paths, both new and old, that can put the cornice into
communication with the ground.With a thick hair-pencil I sweep away
the surplus climbers; with a big brush, one that leaves no smell behind
it--for this might afterwards prove confusing--I carefully rub down the
vase and get rid of every thread which the caterpillars have laid on
the march.When these preparations are finished, a curious sight awaits
us.In the interrupted circular procession there is no longer a leader.Each caterpillar is preceded by another on whose heels he follows
guided by the silk track, the work of the whole party; he again has a
companion close behind him, following him in the same orderly way.And
this is repeated without variation throughout the length of the chain.None commands, or rather none modifies the trail according to his
fancy; all obey, trusting in the guide who ought normally to lead the
march and who in reality has been abolished by my trickery.From the first circuit of the edge of the tub the rail of silk has been
laid in position and is soon turned into a narrow ribbon by the
procession, which never ceases dribbling its thread as it goes.The
rail is simply doubled and has no branches anywhere, for my brush has
destroyed them all.What will the caterpillars do on this deceptive,
closed path?Will they walk endlessly round and round until their
strength gives out entirely?The old schoolmen were fond of quoting Buridan's Ass, that famous
Donkey who, when placed between two bundles of hay, starved to death
because he was unable to decide in favour of either by breaking the
equilibrium between two equal but opposite attractions.The Ass, who is no more foolish than any one else,
would reply to the logical snare by feasting off both bundles.Will my
caterpillars show a little of his mother wit?Will they, after many
attempts, be able to break the equilibrium of their closed circuit,
which keeps them on a road without a turning?Will they make up their
minds to swerve to this side or that, which is the only method of
reaching their bundle of hay, the green branch yonder, quite near, not
two feet off?I thought that they would and I was wrong.I said to myself:

"The procession will go on turning for some time, for an hour, two
hours, perhaps; then the caterpillars will perceive their mistake.They
will abandon the deceptive road and make their descent somewhere or
other."That they should remain up there, hard pressed by hunger and the lack
of cover, when nothing prevented them from going away, seemed to me
inconceivable imbecility.Facts, however, forced me to accept the
incredible.The circular procession begins, as I have said, on the 30th of January,
about midday, in splendid weather.The caterpillars march at an even
pace, each touching the stern of the one in front of him.The unbroken
chain eliminates the leader with his changes of direction; and all
follow mechanically, as faithful to their circle as are the hands of a
watch.The headless file has no liberty left, no will; it has become
mere clockwork.My success goes
far beyond my wildest suspicions.I stand amazed at it, or rather I am
stupefied.Meanwhile, the multiplied circuits change the original rail into a
superb ribbon a twelfth of an inch broad.I can easily see it
glittering on the red ground of the pot.The day is drawing to a close
and no alteration has yet taken place in the position of the trail.The trajectory is not a plane curve, but one which, at a certain point,
deviates and goes down a little way to the lower surface of the
cornice, returning to the top some eight inches farther.I marked these
two points of deviation in pencil on the vase at the outset.Well, all
that afternoon and, more conclusive still, on the following days, right
to the end of this mad dance, I see the string of caterpillars dip
under the ledge at the first point and come to the top again at the
second.Once the first thread is laid, the road to be pursued is
permanently established.If the road does not vary, the speed does.I measure nine centimetres
(3 1/2 inches.--Translator's Note.)But there are more or less lengthy halts; the pace slackens at
times, especially when the temperature falls.At ten o'clock in the
evening the walk is little more than a lazy swaying of the body.I
foresee an early halt, in consequence of the cold, of fatigue and
doubtless also of hunger.The caterpillars have come crowding from all
the nests in the greenhouse to browse upon the pine-branches planted by
myself beside the silken purses.Those in the garden do the same, for
the temperature is mild.The others, lined up along the earthenware
cornice, would gladly take part in the feast; they are bound to have an
appetite after a ten hours' walk.The branch stands green and tempting
not a hand's-breadth away.To reach it they need but go down; and the
poor wretches, foolish slaves of their ribbon that they are, cannot
make up their minds to do so.I leave the famished ones at half-past
ten, persuaded that they will take counsel with their pillow and that
on the morrow things will have resumed their ordinary course.I was expecting too much of them when I accorded them that
faint gleam of intelligence which the tribulations of a distressful
stomach ought, one would think, to have aroused.They are lined up as on the day before, but motionless.When the air
grows a little warmer, they shake off their torpor, revive and start
walking again.The circular procession begins anew, like that which I
have already seen.There is nothing more and nothing less to be noted
in their machine-like obstinacy.A cold snap has supervened, was indeed
foretold in the evening by the garden caterpillars, who refused to come
out despite appearances which to my duller senses seemed to promise a
continuation of the fine weather.At daybreak the rosemary-walks are
all asparkle with rime and for the second time this year there is a
sharp frost.The large pond in the garden is frozen over.What can the
caterpillars in the conservatory be doing?All are ensconced in their nests, except the stubborn processionists on
the edge of the vase, who, deprived of shelter as they are, seem to
have spent a very bad night.I find them clustered in two heaps,
without any attempt at order.They have suffered less from the cold,
thus huddled together.'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody any good.The severity of the night
has caused the ring to break into two segments which will, perhaps,
afford a chance of safety.Each group, as it survives and resumes its
walk, will presently be headed by a leader who, not being obliged to
follow a caterpillar in front of him, will possess some liberty of
movement and perhaps be able to make the procession swerve to one side.Remember that, in the ordinary processions, the caterpillar walking
ahead acts as a scout.While the others, if nothing occurs to create
excitement, keep to their ranks, he attends to his duties as a leader
and is continually turning his head to this side and that,
investigating, seeking, groping, making his choice.And things happen
as he decides: the band follows him faithfully.Remember also that,
even on a road which has already been travelled and beribboned, the
guiding caterpillar continues to explore.There is reason to believe that the Processionaries who have lost their
way on the ledge will find a chance of safety here.On recovering from their torpor, the two groups line up by degrees into
two distinct files.There are therefore two leaders, free to go where
they please, independent of each other.Will they succeed in leaving
the enchanted circle?At the sight of their large black heads swaying
anxiously from side to side, I am inclined to think so for a moment.As the ranks fill out, the two sections of
the chain meet and the circle is reconstituted.The momentary leaders
once more become simple subordinates; and again the caterpillars march
round and round all day.For the second time in succession, the night, which is very calm and
magnificently starry, brings a hard frost.In the morning the
Processionaries on the tub, the only ones who have camped unsheltered,
are gathered into a heap which largely overflows both sides of the
fatal ribbon.I am present at the awakening of the numbed ones.The
first to take the road is, as luck will have it, outside the track.Hesitatingly he ventures into unknown ground.He reaches the top of the
rim and descends upon the other side on the earth in the vase.He is
followed by six others, no more.Perhaps the rest of the troop, who
have not fully recovered from their nocturnal torpor, are too lazy to
bestir themselves.The result of this brief delay is a return to the old track.The
caterpillars embark on the silken trail and the circular march is
resumed, this time in the form of a ring with a gap in it.There is no
attempt, however, to strike a new course on the part of the guide whom
this gap has placed at the head.A chance of stepping outside the magic
circle has presented itself at last; and he does not know how to avail
himself of it.As for the caterpillars who have made their way to the inside of the
vase, their lot is hardly improved.They climb to the top of the palm,
starving and seeking for food.Finding nothing to eat that suits them,
they retrace their steps by following the thread which they have left
on the way, climb the ledge of the pot, strike the procession again
and, without further anxiety, slip back into the ranks.Once more the
ring is complete, once more the circle turns and turns.There is a legend that tells of
poor souls dragged along in an endless round until the hellish charm is
broken by a drop of holy water.What drop will good fortune sprinkle on
my Processionaries to dissolve their circle and bring them back to the
nest?I see only two means of conjuring the spell and obtaining a
release from the circuit.A
strange linking of cause and effect: from sorrow and wretchedness good
is to come.And, first, shriveling as the result of cold, the caterpillars gather
together without any order, heap themselves some on the path, some,
more numerous these, outside it.Among the latter there may be, sooner
or later, some revolutionary who, scorning the beaten track, will trace
out a new road and lead the troop back home.We have just seen an
instance of it.Seven penetrated to the interior of the vase and
climbed the palm.True, it was an attempt with no result but still an
attempt.For complete success, all that need be done would have been to
take the opposite <DW72>.In the second place, the exhaustion due to fatigue and hunger.A lame
one stops, unable to go farther.In front of the defaulter the
procession still continues to wend its way for a short time.The ranks
close up and an empty space appears.On coming to himself and resuming
the march, the caterpillar who has caused the breach becomes a leader,
having nothing before him.The least desire for emancipation is all
that he wants to make him launch the band into a new path which perhaps
will be the saving path.In short, when the Processionaries' train is in difficulties, what it
needs, unlike ours, is to run off the rails.The side-tracking is left
to the caprice of a leader who alone is capable of turning to the right
or left; and this leader is absolutely non-existent so long as the ring
remains unbroken.Lastly, the breaking of the circle, the one stroke of
luck, is the result of a chaotic halt, caused principally by excess of
fatigue or cold.The liberating accident, especially that of fatigue, occurs fairly
often.In the course of the same day, the moving circumference is cut
up several times into two or three sections; but continuity soon
returns and no change takes place.The bold
innovator who is to save the situation has not yet had his inspiration.There is nothing new on the fourth day, after an icy night like the
previous one; nothing to tell except the following detail.Yesterday I
did not remove the trace left by the few caterpillars who made their
way to the inside of the vase.This trace, together with a junction
connecting it with the circular road, is discovered in the course of
the morning.Half the troop takes advantage of it to visit the earth in
the pot and climb the palm; the other half remains on the ledge and
continues to walk along the old rail.In the afternoon the band of
emigrants rejoins the others, the circuit is completed and things
return to their original condition.The night frost becomes more intense, without
however as yet reaching the greenhouse.It is followed by bright
sunshine in a calm and limpid sky.As soon as the sun's rays have
warmed the panes a little, the caterpillars, lying in heaps, wake up
and resume their evolutions on the ledge of the vase.This time the
fine order of the beginning is disturbed and a certain disorder becomes
manifest, apparently an omen of deliverance near at hand.The
scouting-path inside the vase, which was upholstered in silk yesterday
and the day before, is to-day followed to its origin on the rim by a
part of the band and is then deserted after a short loop.The other
caterpillars follow the usual ribbon.The result of this bifurcation is
two almost equal files, walking along the ledge in the same direction,
at a short distance from each other, sometimes meeting, separating
farther on, in every case with some lack of order.The crippled, who refuse to go on,
are many.Breaches increase; files are split up into sections each of
which has its leader, who pokes the front of his body this way and that
to explore the ground.Everything seems to point to the disintegration
which will bring safety.Before
the night the single file is reconstituted and the invincible gyration
resumed.Heat comes, just as suddenly as the cold did.To-day, the 4th of
February, is a beautiful, mild day.Numerous festoons of caterpillars, issuing from the nests, meander
along the sand on the shelf.Above them, at every moment, the ring on
the ledge of the vase breaks up and comes together again.For the first
time I see daring leaders who, drunk with heat, standing only on their
hinder prolegs at the extreme edge of the earthenware rim, fling
themselves forward into space, twisting about, sounding the depths.The
endeavour is frequently repeated, while the whole troop stops.The
caterpillars' heads give sudden jerks, their bodies wriggle.One of the pioneers decides to take the plunge.The others, still confiding in the perfidious
silken path, dare not copy him and continue to go along the old road.The short string detached from the general chain gropes about a great
deal, hesitates long on the side of the vase; it goes half-way down,
then climbs up again slantwise, rejoins and takes its place in the
procession.This time the attempt has failed, though at the foot of the
vase, not nine inches away, there lay a bunch of pine-needles which I
had placed there with the object of enticing the hungry ones.Near as they were to the goal, they went up
again.Threads were laid on the way and
will serve as a lure to further enterprise.The road of deliverance has
its first landmarks.And, two days later, on the eighth day of the
experiment, the caterpillars--now singly, anon in small groups, then
again in strings of some length--come down from the ledge by following
the staked-out path.At sunset the last of the laggards is back in the
nest.For seven times twenty-four hours the
caterpillars have remained on the ledge of the vase.To make an ample
allowance for stops due to the weariness of this one or that and above
all for the rest taken during the colder hours of the night, we will
deduct one-half of the time.The average pace is nine centimetres a minute.(3 1/2
inches.--Translator's Note.)The aggregate distance covered, therefore,
is 453 metres, a good deal more than a quarter of a mile, which is a
great walk for these little crawlers.The circumference of the vase,
the perimeter of the track, is exactly 1 metre 35.(4 feet 5
inches.--Translator's Note.)Therefore the circle covered, always in
the same direction and always without result, was described three
hundred and thirty-five times.These figures surprise me, though I am already familiar with the
abysmal stupidity of insects as a class whenever the least accident
occurs.I feel inclined to ask myself whether the Processionaries were
not kept up there so long by the difficulties and dangers of the
descent rather than by the lack of any gleam of intelligence in their
benighted minds.The facts, however, reply that the descent is as easy
as the ascent.The caterpillar has a very supple back, well adapted for twisting round
projections or slipping underneath.He can walk with the same ease
vertically or horizontally, with his back down or up.Besides, he never
moves forward until he has fixed his thread to the ground.With this
support to his feet, he has no falls to fear, no matter what his
position.I had a proof of this before my eyes during a whole week.As I have
already said, the track, instead of keeping on one level, bends twice,
dips at a certain point under the ledge of the vase and reappears at
the top a little farther on.At one part of the circuit, therefore, the
procession walks on the lower surface of the rim; and this inverted
position implies so little discomfort or danger that it is renewed at
each turn for all the caterpillars from first to last.It is out of the question then to suggest the dread of a false step on
the edge of the rim which is so nimbly turned at each point of
inflexion.The caterpillars in distress, starved, shelterless, chilled
with cold at night, cling obstinately to the silk ribbon covered
hundreds of times, because they lack the rudimentary glimmers of reason
which would advise them to abandon it.The ordeal of a
five hundred yards' march and three to four hundred turns teach them
nothing; and it takes casual circumstances to bring them back to the
nest.They would perish on their insidious ribbon if the disorder of
the nocturnal encampments and the halts due to fatigue did not cast a
few threads outside the circular path.Some three or four move along
these trails, laid without an object, stray a little way and, thanks to
their wanderings, prepare the descent, which is at last accomplished in
short strings favoured by chance.The school most highly honoured to-day is very anxious to find the
origin of reason in the dregs of the animal kingdom.Let me call its
attention to the Pine Processionary.THE NARBONNE LYCOSA, OR BLACK-BELLIED TARANTULA.Michelet has told us how, as a printer's apprentice in a cellar, he
established amicable relations with a Spider.(Jules Michelet
(1798-1874), author of "L'Oiseau" and "L'Insecte," in addition to the
historical works for which he is chiefly known.As a lad, he helped his
father, a printer by trade, in setting type.--Translator's Note.)At a
certain hour of the day, a ray of sunlight would glint through the
window of the gloomy workshop and light up the little compositor's
case.Then his eight-legged neighbour would come down from her web and
on the edge of the case take her share of the sunshine.The boy did not
interfere with her; he welcomed the trusting visitor as a friend and as
a pleasant diversion from the long monotony.When we lack the society
of our fellow-men, we take refuge in that of animals, without always
losing by the change.I do not, thank God, suffer from the melancholy of a cellar: my
solitude is gay with light and verdure; I attend, whenever I please,
the fields' high festival, the Thrushes' concert, the Crickets'
symphony; and yet my friendly commerce with the Spider is marked by an
even greater devotion than the young type-setter's.I admit her to the
intimacy of my study, I make room for her among my books, I set her in
the sun on my window-ledge, I visit her assiduously at her home, in the
country.The object of our relations is not to create a means of escape
from the petty worries of life, pin-pricks whereof I have my share like
other men, a very large share, indeed; I propose to submit to the
Spider a host of questions whereto, at times, she condescends to reply.To what fair problems does not the habit of frequenting her give rise!To set them forth worthily, the marvellous art which the little printer
was to acquire were not too much.One needs the pen of a Michelet; and
I have but a rough, blunt pencil.Let us try, nevertheless: even when
poorly clad, truth is still beautiful.The most robust Spider in my district is the Narbonne Lycosa, or
Black-bellied Tarantula, clad in black velvet on the lower surface,
especially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey
and white rings around the legs.Her favourite home is the dry, pebbly
ground, covered with sun-scorched thyme.In my harmas laboratory there
are quite twenty of this Spider's burrows.Rarely do I pass by one of
these haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam, like
diamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of the hermit.The
four others, which are much smaller, are not visible at that depth.Would I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my
house, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a
dreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from
stone to stone.The love of lucre has laid waste the land.Because wine
paid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine.Then came
the Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land
is now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy
grasses sprout among the pebbles.This waste-land is the Lycosa's
paradise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred
burrows within a limited range.These dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and
then bent elbow-wise.On the edge of
the hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts
and even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut.The whole is kept in
place and cemented with silk.Often, the Spider confines herself to
drawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties
down with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades
from the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of
a masonry constructed of small stones.The nature of the kerb is
decided by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in
the close neighbourhood of the building-yard.There is no selection:
everything meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.The direction is perpendicular, in so far as obstacles, frequent in a
soil of this kind, permit.A bit of gravel can be extracted and hoisted
outside; but a flint is an immovable boulder which the Spider avoids by
giving a bend to her gallery.If more such are met with, the residence
becomes a winding cave, with stone vaults, with lobbies communicating
by means of sharp passages.This lack of plan has no attendant drawbacks, so well does the owner,
from long habit, know every corner and storey of her mansion.If any
interesting buzz occur overhead, the Lycosa climbs up from her rugged
manor with the same speed as from a vertical shaft.Perhaps she even
finds the windings and turnings an advantage, when she has to drag into
her den a prey that happens to defend itself.As a rule, the end of the burrow widens into a side-chamber, a lounge
or resting-place where the Spider meditates at length and is content to
lead a life of quiet when her belly is full.When she reaches maturity and is once settled, the Lycosa becomes
eminently domesticated.I have been living in close communion with her
for the last three years.I have installed her in large earthen pans on
the window-sills of my study and I have her daily under my eyes.Well,
it is very rarely that I happen on her outside, a few inches from her
hole, back to which she bolts at the least alarm.We may take it then that, when not in captivity, the Lycosa does not go
far afield to gather the wherewithal to build her parapet and that she
makes shift with what she finds upon her threshold.In these
conditions, the building-stones are soon exhausted and the masonry
ceases for lack of materials.The wish came over me to see what dimensions the circular edifice would
assume, if the Spider were given an unlimited supply.With captives to
whom I myself act as purveyor the thing is easy enough.Were it only
with a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these
relations with the big Spider of the waste-lands, let me describe how
my subjects are housed.A good-sized earthenware pan, some nine inches deep, is filled with a
red, clayey earth, rich in pebbles, similar, in short, to that of the
places haunted by the Lycosa.Properly moistened into a paste, the
artificial soil is heaped, layer by layer, around a central reed, of a
bore equal to that of the animal's natural burrow.When the receptacle
is filled to the top, I withdraw the reed, which leaves a yawning,
perpendicular shaft.I thus obtain the abode which shall replace that
of the fields.To find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk in the
neighbourhood.When removed from her own dwelling, which is turned
topsy-turvy by my trowel, and placed in possession of the den produced
by my art, the Lycosa at once disappears into that den.She does not
come out again, seeks nothing better elsewhere.A large wire-gauze
cover rests on the soil in the pan and prevents escape.In any case, the watch, in this respect, makes no demand upon my
diligence.The prisoner is satisfied with her new abode and manifests
no regret for her natural burrow.There is no attempt at flight on her
part.Let me not omit to add that each pan must receive not more than
one inhabitant.To her a neighbour is
fair game, to be eaten without scruple when one has might on one's
side.Time was when, unaware of this fierce intolerance, which is more
savage still at breeding time, I saw hideous orgies perpetrated in my
overstocked cages.I shall have occasion to describe those tragedies
later.Let us meanwhile consider the isolated Lycosae.They do not touch up
the dwelling which I have moulded for them with a bit of reed; at most,
now and again, perhaps with the object of forming a lounge or bedroom
at the bottom, they fling out a few loads of rubbish.But all, little
by little, build the kerb that is to edge the mouth.I have given them plenty of first-rate materials, far superior to those
which they use when left to their own resources.These consist, first,
for the foundations, of little smooth stones, some of which are as
large as an almond.With this road-metal are mingled short strips of
raphia, or palm-fibre, flexible ribbons, easily bent.These stand for
the Spider's usual basket-work, consisting of slender stalks and dry
blades of grass.Lastly, by way of an unprecedented treasure, never yet
employed by a Lycosa, I place at my captives' disposal some thick
threads of wool, cut into inch lengths.As I wish, at the same time, to find out whether my animals, with the
magnificent lenses of their eyes, are able to distinguish colours and
prefer one colour to another, I mix up bits of wool of different hues:
there are red, green, white, and yellow pieces.If the Spider have any
preference, she can choose where she pleases.The Lycosa always works at night, a regrettable circumstance, which
does not allow me to follow the worker's methods.I see the result; and
that is all.Were I to visit the building-yard by the light of a
lantern, I should be no wiser.The Spider, who is very shy, would at
once dive into her lair; and I should have lost my sleep for nothing.Furthermore, she is not a very diligent labourer; she likes to take her
time.Two or three bits of wool or raphia placed in position represent
a whole night's work.And to this slowness we must add long spells of
utter idleness.Two months pass; and the result of my liberality surpasses my
expectations.Possessing more windfalls than they know what to do with,
all picked up in their immediate neighbourhood, my Lycosae have built
themselves donjon-keeps the like of which their race has not yet known.Around the orifice, on a slightly sloping bank, small, flat, smooth
stones have been laid to form a broken, flagged pavement.The larger
stones, which are Cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal
that has shifted them, are employed as abundantly as the others.It is an interlacing of raphia and
bits of wool, picked up at random, without distinction of shade.Red
and white, green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order.The
Lycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour.The ultimate result is a sort of muff, a couple of inches high.Bands
of silk, supplied by the spinnerets, unite the pieces, so that the
whole resembles a coarse fabric.Without being absolutely faultless,
for there are always awkward pieces on the outside, which the worker
could not handle, the gaudy building is not devoid of merit.The bird
lining its nest would do no better.Whoso sees the curious,
many- productions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my
industry, contrived with a view to some experimental mischief; and his
surprise is great when I confess who the real author is.No one would
ever believe the Spider capable of constructing such a monument.It goes without saying that, in a state of liberty, on our barren
waste-lands, the Lycosa does not indulge in such sumptuous
architecture.I have given the reason: she is too great a stay-at-home
to go in search of materials and she makes use of the limited resources
which she finds around her.Bits of earth, small chips of stone, a few
twigs, a few withered grasses: that is all, or nearly all.Wherefore
the work is generally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly
attracts attention.My captives teach us that, when materials are plentiful, especially
textile materials that remove all fears of landslip, the Lycosa
delights in tall turrets.She understands the art of donjon-building
and puts it into practice as often as she possesses the means.An
enthusiastic votary of the chase, so long as she is not permanently
fixed, the Lycosa, once she has set up house, prefers to lie in ambush
and wait for the quarry.Every day, when the heat is greatest, I see my
captives come up slowly from under ground and lean upon the battlements
of their woolly castle-keep.They are then really magnificent in their
stately gravity.With their swelling belly contained within the
aperture, their head outside, their glassy eyes staring, their legs
gathered for a spring, for hours and hours they wait, motionless,
bathing voluptuously in the sun.Should a tit-bit to her liking happen to pass, forthwith the watcher
darts from her tall tower, swift as an arrow from the bow.With a
dagger-thrust in the neck, she stabs the jugular of the Locust,
Dragon-fly or other prey whereof I am the purveyor; and she as quickly
scales the donjon and retires with her capture.The performance is a
wonderful exhibition of skill and speed.Very seldom is a quarry missed, provided that it pass at a convenient
distance, within the range of the huntress' bound.But, if the prey be
at some distance, for instance on the wire of the cage, the Lycosa
takes no notice of it.Scorning to go in pursuit, she allows it to roam
at will.She never strikes except when sure of her stroke.She achieves
this by means of her tower.Hiding behind the wall, she sees the
stranger advancing, keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he
comes within reach.Though he were winged and swift of flight, the unwary one who
approaches the ambush is lost.This presumes, it is true, an exemplary patience on the Lycosa's part;
for the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims.At best,
the ledge provided by the turret may, at rare intervals, tempt some
weary wayfarer to use it as a resting-place.But, if the quarry do not
come to-day, it is sure to come to-morrow, the next day, or later, for
the Locusts hop innumerable in the waste-land, nor are they always able
to regulate their leaps.Some day or other, chance is bound to bring
one of them within the purlieus of the burrow.This is the moment to
spring upon the pilgrim from the ramparts.Until then, we maintain a
stoical vigilance.We shall dine when we can; but we shall end by
dining.The Lycosa, therefore, well aware of these lingering eventualities,
waits and is not unduly distressed by a prolonged abstinence.She has
an accommodating stomach, which is satisfied to be gorged to-day and to
remain empty afterwards for goodness knows how long.I have sometimes
neglected my catering duties for weeks at a time; and my boarders have
been none the worse for it.After a more or less protracted fast, they
do not pine away, but are smitten with a wolf-like hunger.All these
ravenous eaters are alike: they guzzle to excess to-day, in
anticipation of to-morrow's dearth.Chance, a poor stand-by, sometimes contrives very well.At the
beginning of the month of August, the children call me to the far side
of the enclosure, rejoicing in a find which they have made under the
rosemary-bushes.It is a magnificent Lycosa, with an enormous belly,
the sign of an impending delivery.Early one morning, ten days later, I find her preparing for her
confinement.A silk network is first spun on the ground, covering an
extent about equal to the palm of one's hand.It is coarse and
shapeless, but firmly fixed.This is the floor on which the Spider
means to operate.John travelled to the office.On this foundation, which acts as a protection from the sand, the
Lycosa fashions a round mat, the size of a two-franc piece and made of
superb white silk.With a gentle, uniform movement, which might be
regulated by the wheels of a delicate piece of clockwork, the tip of
the abdomen rises and falls, each time touching the supporting base a
little farther away, until the extreme scope of the mechanism is
attained.Then, without the Spider's moving her position, the oscillation is
resumed in the opposite direction.By means of this alternate motion,
interspersed with numerous contacts, a segment of the sheet is
obtained, of a very accurate texture.When this is done, the Spider
moves a little along a circular line and the loom works in the same
manner on another segment.The silk disk, a sort of hardy concave paten, now no longer receives
anything from the spinnerets in its centre; the marginal belt alone
increases in thickness.The piece thus becomes a bowl-shaped porringer,
surrounded by a wide, flat edge.With one quick emission, the viscous,
pale-yellow eggs are laid in the basin, where they heap together in the
shape of a globe which projects largely outside the cavity.The
spinnerets are once more set going.With short movements, as the tip of
the abdomen rises and falls to weave the round mat, they cover up the
exposed hemisphere.The result is a pill set in the middle of a
circular carpet.The legs, hitherto idle, are now working.They take up and break off
one by one the threads that keep the round mat stretched on the coarse
supporting network.At the same time the fangs grip this sheet, lift it
by degrees, tear it from its base and fold it over upon the globe of
eggs.The whole edifice totters, the floor
collapses, fouled with sand.By a movement of the legs, those soiled
shreds are cast aside.Briefly, by means of violent tugs of the fangs,
which pull, and broom-like efforts of the legs, which clear away, the
Lycosa extricates the bag of eggs and removes it as a clear-cut mass,
free from any adhesion.It is a white-silk pill, soft to the touch and glutinous.Its size is
that of an average cherry.An observant eye will notice, running
horizontally around the middle, a fold which a needle is able to raise
without breaking it.This hem, generally undistinguishable from the
rest of the surface, is none other than the edge of the circular mat,
drawn over the lower hemisphere.The other hemisphere, through which
the youngsters will go out, is less well fortified: its only wrapper is
the texture spun over the eggs immediately after they were laid.The work of spinning, followed by that of tearing, is continued for a
whole morning, from five to nine o'clock.Worn out with fatigue, the
mother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless.I shall see no
more to-day.Next morning, I find the Spider carrying the bag of eggs
slung from her stern.Henceforth, until the hatching, she does not leave go of the precious
burden, which, fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament, drags
and bumps along the ground.With this load banging against her heels,
she goes about her business; she walks or rests, she seeks her prey,
attacks it and devours it.Should some accident cause the wallet to
drop off, it is soon replaced.The spinnerets touch it somewhere,
anywhere, and that is enough: adhesion is at once restored.When the work is done, some of them emancipate themselves, think they
will have a look at the country before retiring for good and all.It is
these whom we meet at times, wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag
behind them.Sooner or later, however, the vagrants return home; and
the month of August is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow
will bring the mother up, with her wallet slung behind her.I am able
to procure as many as I want and, with them, to indulge in certain
experiments of the highest interest.It is a sight worth seeing, that of the Lycosa dragging her treasure
after her, never leaving it, day or night, sleeping or waking, and
defending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe.If I
try to take the bag from her, she presses it to her breast in despair,
hangs on to my pincers, bites them with her poison-fangs.I can hear
the daggers grating on the steel.No, she would not allow herself to be
robbed of the wallet with impunity, if my fingers were not supplied
with an implement.By dint of pulling and shaking the pill with the forceps, I take it
from the Lycosa, who protests furiously.I fling her in exchange a pill
taken from another Lycosa.It is at once seized in the fangs, embraced
by the legs and hung on to the spinneret.Her own or another's: it is
all one to the Spider, who walks away proudly with the alien wallet.This was to be expected, in view of the similarity of the pills
exchanged.A test of another kind, with a second subject, renders the mistake more
striking.I substitute, in the place of the lawful bag which I have
removed, the work of the Silky Epeira.The colour and softness of the
material are the same in both cases; but the shape is quite different.The stolen object is a globe; the object presented in exchange is an
elliptical conoid studded with angular projections along the edge of
the base.The Spider takes no account of this dissimilarity.She
promptly glues the queer bag to her spinnerets and is as pleased as
though she were in possession of her real pill.My experimental
villainies have no other consequence beyond an ephemeral carting.When
hatching-time arrives, early in the case of Lycosa, late in that of the
Epeira, the gulled Spider abandons the strange bag and pays it no
further attention.Let us penetrate yet deeper into the wallet-bearer's stupidity.After
depriving the Lycosa of her eggs, I throw her a ball of cork, roughly
polished with a file and of the same size as the stolen pill.She
accepts the corky substance, so different from the silk purse, without
the least demur.One would have thought that she would recognize her
mistake with those eight eyes of hers, which gleam like precious
stones.Lovingly she embraces the
cork ball, fondles it with her palpi, fastens it to her spinnerets and
thenceforth drags it after her as though she were dragging her own bag.Let us give another the choice between the imitation and the real.The
rightful pill and the cork ball are placed together on the floor of the
jar.Will the Spider be able to know the one that belongs to her?The
fool is incapable of doing so.She makes a wild rush and seizes
haphazard at one time her property, at another my sham product.Whatever is first touched becomes a good capture and is forthwith hung
up.If I increase the number of cork balls, if I put in four or five of
them, with the real pill among them, it is seldom that the Lycosa
recovers her own property.Attempts at inquiry, attempts at selection
there are none.Whatever she snaps up at random she sticks to, be it
good or bad.As there are more of the sham pills of cork, these are the
most often seized by the Spider.Can the animal be deceived by the soft
contact of the cork?I replace the cork balls by pellets of cotton or
paper, kept in their round shape with a few bands of thread.Both are
very readily accepted instead of the real bag that has been removed.Can the illusion be due to the colouring, which is light in the cork
and not unlike the tint of the silk globe when soiled with a little
earth, while it is white in the paper and the cotton, when it is
identical with that of the original pill?I give the Lycosa, in
exchange for her work, a pellet of silk thread, chosen of a fine red,
the brightest of all colours.The uncommon pill is as readily accepted
and as jealously guarded as the others.For three weeks and more the Lycosa trails the bag of eggs hanging to
her spinnerets.The reader will remember the experiments described in
the preceding section, particularly those with the cork ball and the
thread pellet which the Spider so foolishly accepts in exchange for the
real pill.Well, this exceedingly dull-witted mother, satisfied with
aught that knocks against her heels, is about to make us wonder at her
devotion.Whether she come up from her shaft to lean upon the kerb and bask in
the sun, whether she suddenly retire underground in the face of danger,
or whether she be roaming the country before settling down, never does
she let go her precious bag, that very cumbrous burden in walking,
climbing or leaping.If, by some accident, it become detached from the
fastening to which it is hung, she flings herself madly on her treasure
and lovingly embraces it, ready to bite whoso would take it from her.I then hear the points of the
poison-fangs grinding against the steel of my pincers, which tug in one
direction while the Lycosa tugs in the other.But let us leave the
animal alone: with a quick touch of the spinnerets, the pill is
restored to its place; and the Spider strides off, still menacing.Towards the end of summer, all the householders, old or young, whether
in captivity on the window-sill or at liberty in the paths of the
enclosure, supply me daily with the following improving sight.In the
morning, as soon as the sun is hot and beats upon their burrow, the
anchorites come up from the bottom with their bag and station
themselves at the opening.Long siestas on the threshold in the sun are
the order of the day throughout the fine season; but, at the present
time, the position adopted is a different one.Formerly, the Lycosa
came out into the sun for her own sake.Leaning on the parapet, she had
the front half of her body outside the pit and the hinder half inside.The eyes took their fill of light; the belly remained in the dark.When
carrying her egg-bag, the Spider reverses the posture: the front is in
the pit, the rear outside.With her hind-legs she holds the white pill
bulging with germs lifted above the entrance; gently she turns and
turns it, so as to present every side to the life-giving rays.And this
goes on for half the day, so long as the temperature is high; and it is
repeated daily, with exquisite patience, during three or four weeks.To
hatch its eggs, the bird covers them with the quilt of its breast; it
strains them to the furnace of its heart.The Lycosa turns hers in
front of the hearth of hearths: she gives them the sun as an incubator.In the early days of September the young ones, who have been some time
hatched, are ready to come out.The whole family emerges from the bag straightway.Then and there, the
youngsters climb to the mother's back.As for the empty bag, now a
worthless shred, it is flung out of the burrow; the Lycosa does not
give it a further thought.Huddled together, sometimes in two or three
layers, according to their number, the little ones cover the whole back
of the mother, who, for seven or eight months to come, will carry her
family night and day.Nowhere can we hope to see a more edifying
domestic picture than that of the Lycosa clothed in her young.From time to time I meet a little band of gipsies passing along the
high-road on their way to some neighbouring fair.The new-born babe
mewls on the mother's breast, in a hammock formed out of a kerchief.The last-weaned is carried pick-a-back; a third toddles clinging to its
mother's skirts; others follow closely, the biggest in the rear,
ferreting in the blackberry-laden hedgerows.It is a magnificent
spectacle of happy-go-lucky fruitfulness.They go their way, penniless
and rejoicing.The sun is hot and the earth is fertile.But how this picture pales before that of the Lycosa, that incomparable
gipsy whose brats are numbered by the hundred!And one and all of them,
from September to April, without a moment's respite, find room upon the
patient creature's back, where they are content to lead a tranquil life
and to be carted about.The little ones are very good; none moves, none seeks a quarrel with
his neighbours.Clinging together, they form a continuous drapery, a
shaggy ulster under which the mother becomes unrecognizable.Is it an
animal, a fluff of wool, a cluster of small seeds fastened to one
another?'Tis impossible to tell at the first glance.The equilibrium of this living blanket is not so firm but that falls
often occur, especially when the mother climbs from indoors and comes
to the threshold to let the little ones take the sun.The least brush
against the gallery unseats a part of the family.The Hen, fidgeting about her Chicks, looks for the strays,
calls them, gathers them together.The Lycosa knows not these maternal
alarms.Impassively, she leaves those who drop off to manage their own
difficulty, which they do with wonderful quickness.Commend me to those
youngsters for getting up without whining, dusting themselves and
resuming their seat in the saddle!The unhorsed ones promptly find a
leg of the mother, the usual climbing-pole; they swarm up it as fast as
they can and recover their places on the bearer's back.The living bark
of animals is reconstructed in the twinkling of an eye.To speak here of mother-love were, I think, extravagant.The Lycosa's
affection for her offspring hardly surpasses that of the plant, which
is unacquainted with any tender feeling and nevertheless bestows the
nicest and most delicate care upon its seeds.The animal, in many
cases, knows no other sense of motherhood.What cares the Lycosa for
her brood!She accepts another's as readily as her own; she is
satisfied so long as her back is burdened with a swarming crowd,
whether it issue from her ovaries or elsewhere.There is no question
here of real maternal affection.I have described elsewhere the prowess of the Copris watching over
cells that are not her handiwork and do not contain her offspring.With
a zeal which even the additional labour laid upon her does not easily
weary, she removes the mildew from the alien dung-balls, which far
exceed the regular nests in number; she gently scrapes and polishes and
repairs them; she listens attentively and enquires by ear into each
nurseling's progress.Her real collection could not receive greater
care.Her own family or another's: it is all one to her.I take a hair-pencil and sweep the
living burden from one of my Spiders, making it fall close to another
covered with her little ones.The evicted youngsters scamper about,
find the new mother's legs outspread, nimbly clamber up these and mount
on the back of the obliging creature, who quietly lets them have their
way.They slip in among the others, or, when the layer is too thick,
push to the front and pass from the abdomen to the thorax and even to
the head, though leaving the region of the eyes uncovered.It does not
do to blind the bearer: the common safety demands that.They know this
and respect the lenses of the eyes, however populous the assembly be.The whole animal is now covered with a swarming carpet of young, all
except the legs, which must preserve their freedom of action, and the
under part of the body, where contact with the ground is to be feared.My pencil forces a third family upon the already over-burdened Spider;
and this too is peacefully accepted.The youngsters huddle up closer,
lie one on top of the other in layers and room is found for all.The
Lycosa has lost the last semblance of an animal, has become a nameless
bristling thing that walks about.Falls are frequent and are followed
by continual climbings.I perceive that I have reached the limits, not of the bearer's
good-will, but of equilibrium.The Spider would adopt an indefinite
further number of foundlings, if the dimensions of her back afforded
them a firm hold.Let us restore each
family to its mother, drawing at random from the lot.There must
necessarily be interchanges, but that is of no importance: real
children and adopted children are the same thing in the Lycosa's eyes.One would like to know if, apart from my artifices, in circumstances
where I do not interfere, the good-natured dry-nurse sometimes burdens
herself with a supplementary family; it would also be interesting to
learn what comes of this association of lawful offspring and strangers.I have ample materials wherewith to obtain an answer to both questions.I have housed in the same cage two elderly matrons laden with
youngsters.Each has her home as far removed from the other's as the
size of the common pan permits.Proximity soon kindles fierce jealousies between those
intolerant creatures, who are obliged to live far apart so as to secure
adequate hunting-grounds.One morning I catch the two harridans fighting out their quarrel on the
floor.The loser is laid flat upon her back; the victress, belly to
belly with her adversary, clutches her with her legs and prevents her
from moving a limb.Both have their poison-fangs wide open, ready to
bite without yet daring, so mutually formidable are they.After a
certain period of waiting, during which the pair merely exchange
threats, the stronger of the two, the one on top, closes her lethal
engine and grinds the head of the prostrate foe.Then she calmly
devours the deceased by small mouthfuls.Now what do the youngsters do, while their mother is being eaten?Easily consoled, heedless of the atrocious scene, they climb on the
conqueror's back and quietly take their places among the lawful family.The ogress raises no objection, accepts them as her own.She makes a
meal off the mother and adopts the orphans.Let us add that, for many months yet, until the final emancipation
comes, she will carry them without drawing any distinction between them
and her own young.Henceforth the two families, united in so tragic a
fashion, will form but one.We see how greatly out of place it would be
to speak, in this connection, of mother-love and its fond
manifestations.Does the Lycosa at least feed the younglings who, for seven months,
swarm upon her back?Does she invite them to the banquet when she has
secured a prize?I thought so at first; and, anxious to assist at the
family repast, I devoted special attention to watching the mothers eat.As a rule, the prey is consumed out of sight, in the burrow; but
sometimes also a meal is taken on the threshold, in the open air.Besides, it is easy to rear the Lycosa and her family in a wire-gauze
cage, with a layer of earth wherein the captive will never dream of
sinking a well, such work being out of season.Well, while the mother munches, chews, expresses the juices and
swallows, the youngsters do not budge from their camping-ground on her
back.Not one quits its place nor gives a sign of wishing to slip down
and join in the meal.Nor does the mother extend an invitation to them
to come and recruit themselves, nor put any broken victuals aside for
them.She feeds and the others look on, or rather remain indifferent to
what is happening.Their perfect quiet during the Lycosa's feast points
to the possession of a stomach that knows no cravings.Then with what are they sustained, during their seven months'
upbringing on the mother's back?One conceives a notion of exudations
supplied by the bearer's body, in which case the young would feed on
their mother, after the manner of parasitic vermin, and gradually drain
her strength.Never are they seen to put their mouths to
the skin that should be a sort of teat to them.On the other hand, the
Lycosa, far from being exhausted and shrivelling, keeps perfectly well
and plump.She has the same pot-belly when she finishes rearing her
young as when she began.She has not lost weight: far from it; on the
contrary, she has put on flesh: she has gained the wherewithal to beget
a new family next summer, one as numerous as to-day's.Once more, with what do the little ones keep up their strength?We do
not like to suggest reserves supplied by the egg as rectifying the
animal's expenditure of vital force, especially when we consider that
those reserves, themselves so close to nothing, must be economized in
view of the silk, a material of the highest importance, of which a
plentiful use will be made presently.There must be other powers at
play in the tiny animal's machinery.Total abstinence from food could be understood, if it were accompanied
by inertia: immobility is not life.But the young Lycosae, though
usually quiet on their mother's back, are at all times ready for
exercise and for agile swarming.When they fall from the maternal
perambulator, they briskly pick themselves up, briskly scramble up a
leg and make their way to the top.It is a splendidly nimble and
spirited performance.Besides, once seated, they have to keep a firm
balance in the mass; they have to stretch and stiffen their little
limbs in order to hang on to their neighbours.As a matter of fact,
there is no absolute rest for them.Now physiology teaches us that not
a fibre works without some expenditure of energy.The animal, which can
be likened, in no small measure, to our industrial machines, demands,
on the one hand, the renovation of its organism, which wears out with
movement, and, on the other, the maintenance of the heat transformed
into action.We can compare it with the locomotive-engine.As the iron
horse performs its work, it gradually wears out its pistons, its rods,
its wheels, its boiler-tubes, all of which have to be made good from
time to time.The founder and the smith repair it, supply it, so to
speak, with 'plastic food,' the food that becomes embodied with the
whole and forms part of it.But, though it have just come from the
engine-shop, it is still inert.To acquire the power of movement it
must receive from the stoker a supply of 'energy-producing food'; in
other words, he lights a few shovelfuls of coal in its inside.As nothing is made from nothing, the egg
supplies first the materials of the new-born animal; then the plastic
food, the smith of living creatures, increases the body, up to a
certain limit, and renews it as it wears away.The stoker works at the
same time, without stopping.Fuel, the source of energy, makes but a
short stay in the system, where it is consumed and furnishes heat,
whence movement is derived.Warmed by its food, the
animal machine moves, walks, runs, jumps, swims, flies, sets its
locomotory apparatus going in a thousand manners.To return to the young Lycosae, they grow no larger until the period of
their emancipation.I find them at the age of seven months the same as
when I saw them at their birth.The egg supplied the materials
necessary for their tiny frames; and, as the loss of waste substance
is, for the moment, excessively small, or even nil, additional plastic
food is not needed so long as the wee creature does not grow.In this
respect, the prolonged abstinence presents no difficulty.But there
remains the question of energy-producing food, which is indispensable,
for the little Lycosa moves, when necessary, and very actively at that.To what shall we attribute the heat expended upon action, when the
animal takes absolutely no nourishment?We say to ourselves that, without being life,
a machine is something more than matter, for man has added a little of
his mind to it.Now the iron beast, consuming its ration of coal, is
really browsing the ancient foliage of arborescent ferns in which solar
energy has accumulated.Beasts of flesh and blood act no otherwise.Whether they mutually
devour one another or levy tribute on the plant, they invariably
quicken themselves with the stimulant of the sun's heat, a heat stored
in grass, fruit, seed and those which feed on such.The sun, the soul
of the universe, is the supreme dispenser of energy.Instead of being served up through the intermediary of food and passing
through the ignominious circuit of gastric chemistry, could not this
solar energy penetrate the animal directly and charge it with activity,
even as the battery charges an accumulator with power?Why not live on
sun, seeing that, after all, we find naught but sun in the fruits which
we consume?Chemical science, that bold revolutionary, promises to provide us with
synthetic foodstuffs.The laboratory and the factory will take the
place of the farm.Why should not physical science step in as well?It
would leave the preparation of plastic food to the chemist's retorts;
it would reserve for itself that of energy-producing food which,
reduced to its exact terms, ceases to be matter.With the aid of some
ingenious apparatus, it would pump into us our daily ration of solar
energy, to be later expended in movement, whereby the machine would be
kept going without the often painful assistance of the stomach and its
adjuncts.What a delightful world, where one could lunch off a ray of
sunshine!Is it a dream, or the anticipation of a remote reality?The problem is
one of the most important that science can set us.Let us first hear
the evidence of the young Lycosae regarding its possibilities.For seven months, without any material nourishment, they expend
strength in moving.To wind up the mechanism of their muscles, they
recruit themselves direct with heat and light.During the time when she
was dragging the bag of eggs behind her, the mother, at the best
moments of the day, came and held up her pill to the sun.With her two
hind-legs she lifted it out of the ground into the full light; slowly
she turned it and turned it, so that every side might receive its share
of the vivifying rays.Well, this bath of life, which awakened the
germs, is now prolonged to keep the tender babes active.Daily, if the sky be clear, the Lycosa, carrying her young, comes up
from the burrow, leans on the kerb and spends long hours basking in the
sun.Here, on their mother's back, the youngsters stretch their limbs
delightedly, saturate themselves with heat, take in reserves of
motor-power, absorb energy.They are motionless; but, if I only blow upon them, they stampede as
nimbly as though a hurricane were passing.Hurriedly, they disperse;
hurriedly, they reassemble: a proof that, without material nourishment,
the little animal machine is always at full pressure, ready to work.When the shade comes, mother and sons go down again, surfeited with
solar emanations.The feast of energy at the Sun Tavern is finished for
the day.The fowling-snare is one of man's ingenious villainies.With lines,
pegs and poles, two large, earth- nets are stretched upon the
ground, one to the right, the other to the left of a bare surface.A
long cord, pulled at the right moment by the fowler, who hides in a
brushwood hut, works them and brings them together suddenly, like a
pair of shutters.Divided between the two nets are the cages of the decoy-birds--Linnets
and Chaffinches, Greenfinches and Yellowhammers, Buntings and
Ortolans--sharp-eared creatures which, on perceiving the distant
passage of a flock of their own kind, forthwith utter a short calling
note.One of them, the Sambe, an irresistible tempter, hops about and
flaps his wings in apparent freedom.A bit of twine fastens him to his
convict's stake.When, worn with fatigue and driven desperate by his
vain attempts to get away, the sufferer lies down flat and refuses to
do his duty, the fowler is able to stimulate him without stirring from
his hut.A long string sets in motion a little lever working on a
pivot.Raised from the ground by this diabolical contrivance, the bird
flies, falls down and flies up again at each jerk of the cord.The fowler waits, in the mild sunlight of the autumn morning.The Chaffinches chirp their rallying
cry:

"Pinck!They are
coming, the simpletons; they swoop down upon the treacherous floor.With a rapid movement, the man in ambush pulls his string.The nets
close and the whole flock is caught.Man has wild beast's blood in his veins.The fowler hastens to the
slaughter.With his thumb he stifles the beating of the captives'
hearts, staves in their skulls.The little birds, so many piteous heads
of game, will go to market, strung in dozens on a wire passed through
their nostrils.For scoundrelly ingenuity, the Epeira's net can bear comparison with
the fowler's; it even surpasses it when, on patient study, the main
features of its supreme perfection stand revealed.What refinement of
art for a mess of Flies!Nowhere, in the whole animal kingdom, has the
need to eat inspired a more cunning industry.If the reader will
meditate upon the description that follows, he will certainly share my
admiration.In bearing and colouring, Epeira fasciata is the handsomest of the
Spiders of the South.On her fat belly, a mighty silk-warehouse nearly
as large as a hazel-nut, are alternate yellow, black and silver sashes,
to which she owes her epithet of Banded.Around that portly abdomen the
eight long legs, with their dark- and pale-brown rings, radiate like
spokes.Any small prey suits her; and, as long as she can find supports for her
web, she settles wherever the Locust hops, wherever the Fly hovers,
wherever the Dragon-fly dances or the Butterfly flits.As a rule,
because of the greater abundance of game, she spreads her toils across
some brooklet, from bank to bank among the rushes.She also stretches
them, but not so assiduously, in the thickets of evergreen oak, on the
<DW72>s with the scrubby greenswards, dear to the Grasshoppers.Her hunting-weapon is a large upright web, whose outer boundary, which
varies according to the disposition of the ground, is fastened to the
neighbouring branches by a number of moorings.Let us see, first of
all, how the ropes which form the framework of the building are
obtained.All day invisible, crouching amid the cypress-leaves, the Spider, at
about eight o'clock in the evening, solemnly emerges from her retreat
and makes for the top of a branch.In this exalted position she sits
for sometime laying her plans with due regard to the locality; she
consults the weather, ascertains if the night will be fine.Then,
suddenly, with her eight legs widespread, she lets herself drop
straight down, hanging to the line that issues from her spinnerets.Just as the rope-maker obtains the even output of his hemp by walking
backwards, so does the Epeira obtain the discharge of hers by falling.It is extracted by the weight of her body.The descent, however, has not the brute speed which the force of
gravity would give it, if uncontrolled.It is governed by the action of
the spinnerets, which contract or expand their pores, or close them
entirely, at the faller's pleasure.And so, with gentle moderation, she
pays out this living plumb-line, of which my lantern clearly shows me
the plumb, but not always the line.The great squab seems at such times
to be sprawling in space, without the least support.She comes to an abrupt stop two inches from the ground; the silk-reel
ceases working.The Spider turns round, clutches the line which she has
just obtained and climbs up by this road, still spinning.But, this
time, as she is no longer assisted by the force of gravity, the thread
is extracted in another manner.The two hind-legs, with a quick
alternate action, draw it from the wallet and let it go.On returning to her starting-point, at a height of six feet or more,
the Spider is now in possession of a double line, bent into a loop and
floating loosely in a current of air.She fixes her end where it suits
her and waits until the other end, wafted by the wind, has fastened its
loop to the adjacent twigs.Feeling her thread fixed, the Epeira runs along it repeatedly, from end
to end, adding a fibre to it on each journey.Whether I help or not,
this forms the "suspension cable," the main piece of the framework.I
call it a cable, in spite of its extreme thinness, because of its
structure.It looks as though it were single, but, at the two ends, it
is seen to divide and spread, tuft-wise, into numerous constituent
parts, which are the product of as many crossings.These diverging
fibres, with their several contact-points, increase the steadiness of
the two extremities.The suspension-cable is incomparably stronger than the rest of the work
and lasts for an indefinite time.The web is generally shattered after
the night's hunting and is nearly always rewoven on the following
evening.After the removal of the wreckage, it is made all over again,
on the same site, cleared of everything except the cable from which the
new network is to hang.Once the cable is laid, in this way or in that, the Spider is in
possession of a base that allows her to approach or withdraw from the
leafy piers at will.From the height of the cable she lets herself slip
to a slight depth, varying the points of her fall.In this way she
obtains, to right and left, a few slanting cross-bars, connecting the
cable with the branches.These cross-bars, in their turn, support others in ever changing
directions.When there are enough of them, the Epeira need no longer
resort to falls in order to extract her threads; she goes from one cord
to the next, always wire-drawing with her hind-legs.This results in a
combination of straight lines owning no order, save that they are kept
in one nearly perpendicular plane.Thus is marked out a very irregular
polygonal area, wherein the web, itself a work of magnificent
regularity, shall presently be woven.In the lower part of the web, starting from the centre, a wide opaque
ribbon descends zigzag-wise across the radii.This is the Epeira's
trade-mark, the flourish of an artist initialling his creation."Fecit
So-and-so," she seems to say, when giving the last throw of the shuttle
to her handiwork.That the Spider feels satisfied when, after passing and repassing from
spoke to spoke, she finishes her spiral, is beyond a doubt: the work
achieved ensures her food for a few days to come.But, in this
particular case, the vanity of the spinstress has naught to say to the
matter: the strong silk zigzag is added to impart greater firmness to
the web.The spiral network of the Epeirae possesses contrivances of fearsome
cunning.The thread that forms it is seen with the naked eye to differ
from that of the framework and the spokes.It glitters in the sun,
looks as though it were knotted and gives the impression of a chaplet
of atoms.To examine it through the lens on the web itself is scarcely
feasible, because of the shaking of the fabric, which trembles at the
least breath.By passing a sheet of glass under the web and lifting it,
I take away a few pieces of thread to study, pieces that remain fixed
to the glass in parallel lines.Lens and microscope can now play their
part.Those threads, on the borderland
between the visible and the invisible, are very closely twisted twine,
similar to the gold cord of our officers' sword-knots.The infinitely slender is a tube, a channel full of a
viscous moisture resembling a strong solution of gum arabic.I can see
a diaphanous trail of this moisture trickling through the broken ends.Under the pressure of the thin glass slide that covers them on the
stage of the microscope, the twists lengthen out, become crinkled
ribbons, traversed from end to end, through the middle, by a dark
streak, which is the empty container.The fluid contents must ooze slowly through the side of those tubular
threads, rolled into twisted strings, and thus render the network
sticky.It is sticky, in fact, and in such a way as to provoke
surprise.I bring a fine straw flat down upon three or four rungs of a
sector.However gentle the contact, adhesion is at once established.When I lift the straw, the threads come with it and stretch to twice or
three times their length, like a thread of india-rubber.At last, when
over-taut, they loosen without breaking and resume their original form.They lengthen by unrolling their twist, they shorten by rolling it
again; lastly, they become adhesive by taking the glaze of the gummy
moisture wherewith they are filled.In short, the spiral thread is a capillary tube finer than any that our
physics will ever know.It is rolled into a twist so as to possess an
elasticity that allows it, without breaking, to yield to the tugs of
the captured prey; it holds a supply of sticky matter in reserve in its
tube, so as to renew the adhesive properties of the surface by
incessant exudation, as they become impaired by exposure to the air.The Epeira hunts not with springs, but with lime-snares.Everything is caught in them, down to the dandelion-plume
that barely brushes against them.Nevertheless, the Epeira, who is in
constant touch with her web, is not caught in them.Because the
Spider has contrived for herself, in the middle of her trap, a floor in
whose construction the sticky spiral thread plays no part.There is
here, covering a space which, in the larger webs, is about equal to the
palm of one's hand, a neutral fabric in which the exploring straw finds
no adhesiveness anywhere.Here, on this central resting-floor, and here only, the Epeira takes
her stand, waiting whole days for the arrival of the game.However
close, however prolonged her contact with this portion of the web, she
runs no risk of sticking to it, because the gummy coating is lacking,
as is the twisted and tubular structure, throughout the length of the
spokes and throughout the extent of the auxiliary spiral.These pieces,
together with the rest of the framework, are made of plain, straight,
solid thread.But when a victim is caught, sometimes right at the edge of the web,
the Spider has to rush up quickly, to bind it and overcome its attempts
to free itself.She is walking then upon her network; and I do not find
that she suffers the least inconvenience.The lime-threads are not even
lifted by the movements of her legs.In my boyhood, when a troop of us would go, on Thursdays (The weekly
half-day in French schools.--Translator's Note.), to try and catch a
Goldfinch in the hemp-fields, we used, before covering the twigs with
glue, to grease our fingers with a few drops of oil, lest we should get
them caught in the sticky matter.Does the Epeira know the secret of
fatty substances?I rub my exploring straw with slightly oiled paper.When applied to the
spiral thread of the web, it now no longer sticks to it.I pull out the leg of a live Epeira.Brought just as it
is into contact with the lime-threads, it does not stick to them any
more than to the neutral cords, whether spokes or part of the
framework.We were entitled to expect this, judging by the Spider's
general immunity.But here is something that wholly alters the result.I put the leg to
soak for a quarter of an hour in disulphide of carbon, the best solvent
of fatty matters.I wash it carefully with a brush dipped in the same
fluid.When this washing is finished, the leg sticks to the
snaring-thread quite easily and adheres to it just as well as anything
else would, the unoiled straw, for instance.Did I guess aright when I judged that it was a fatty substance that
preserved the Epeira from the snares of her sticky Catherine-wheel?The
action of the carbon-disulphide seems to say yes.Besides, there is no
reason why a substance of this kind, which plays so frequent a part in
animal economy, should not coat the Spider very slightly by the mere
act of perspiration.We used to rub our fingers with a little oil
before handling the twigs in which the Goldfinch was to be caught; even
so the Epeira varnishes herself with a special sweat, to operate on any
part of her web without fear of the lime-threads.However, an unduly protracted stay on the sticky threads would have its
drawbacks.In the long run, continual contact with those threads might
produce a certain adhesion and inconvenience to the Spider, who must
preserve all her agility in order to rush upon the prey before it can
release itself.For this reason, gummy threads are never used in
building the post of interminable waiting.It is only on her resting-floor that the Epeira sits, motionless and
with her eight legs outspread, ready to mark the least quiver in the
net.It is here, again, that she takes her meals, often long-drawn out,
when the joint is a substantial one; it is hither that, after trussing
and nibbling it, she drags her prey at the end of a thread, to consume
it at her ease on a non-viscous mat.As a hunting-post and refectory,
the Epeira has contrived a central space, free from glue.As for the glue itself, it is hardly possible to study its chemical
properties, because the quantity is so slight.The microscope shows it
trickling from the broken threads in the form of a transparent and more
or less granular streak.The following experiment will tell us more
about it.With a sheet of glass passed across the web, I gather a series of
lime-threads which remain fixed in parallel lines.I cover this sheet
with a bell-jar standing in a depth of water.Soon, in this atmosphere
saturated with humidity, the threads become enveloped in a watery
sheath, which gradually increases and begins to flow.The twisted shape
has by this time disappeared; and the channel of the thread reveals a
chaplet of translucent orbs, that is to say, a series of extremely fine
drops.In twenty-four hours the threads have lost their contents and are
reduced to almost invisible streaks.If I then lay a drop of water on
the glass, I get a sticky solution similar to that which a particle of
gum arabic might yield.The conclusion is evident: the Epeira's glue is
a substance that absorbs moisture freely.In an atmosphere with a high
degree of humidity, it becomes saturated and percolates by sweating
through the side of the tubular threads.These data explain certain facts relating to the work of the net.The
Epeirae weave at very early hours, long before dawn.Should the air
turn misty, they sometimes leave that part of the task unfinished: they
build the general framework, they lay the spokes, they even draw the
auxiliary spiral, for all these parts are unaffected by excess of
moisture; but they are very careful not to work at the lime-threads,
which, if soaked by the fog, would dissolve into sticky shreds and lose
their efficacy by being wetted.The net that was started will be
finished to-morrow, if the atmosphere be favourable.While the highly-absorbent character of the snaring-thread has its
drawbacks, it also has compensating advantages.The Epeirae, when
hunting by day, affect those hot places, exposed to the fierce rays of
the sun, wherein the Crickets delight.In the torrid heats of the
dog-days, therefore, the lime-threads, but for special provisions,
would be liable to dry up, to shrivel into stiff and lifeless
filaments.At the most scorching times
of the day they continue supple, elastic and more and more adhesive.The
moisture of which the air is never deprived penetrates them slowly; it
dilutes the thick contents of their tubes to the requisite degree and
causes it to ooze through, as and when the earlier stickiness
decreases.What bird-catcher could vie with the Garden Spider in the
art of laying lime-snares?And all this industry and cunning for the
capture of a Moth!I should like an anatomist endowed with better implements than mine and
with less tired eyesight to explain to us the work of the marvellous
rope-yard.How is the silken matter moulded into a capillary tube?How
is this tube filled with glue and tightly twisted?And how does this
same mill also turn out plain threads, wrought first into a framework
and then into muslin and satin?What a number of products to come from
that curious factory, a Spider's belly!I behold the results, but fail
to understand the working of the machine.I leave the problem to the
masters of the microtome and the scalpel.The Epeirae are monuments of patience in their lime-snare.With her
head down and her eight legs widespread, the Spider occupies the centre
of the web, the receiving-point of the information sent along the
spokes.If anywhere, behind or before, a vibration occur, the sign of a
capture, the Epeira knows about it, even without the aid of sight.Until then, not a movement: one would think that the animal was
hypnotized by her watching.At most, on the appearance of anything
suspicious, she begins shaking her nest.This is her way of inspiring
the intruder with awe.If I myself wish to provoke the singular alarm,
I have but to tease the Epeira with a bit of straw.You cannot have a
swing without an impulse of some sort.The terror-stricken Spider, who
wishes to strike terror into others, has hit upon something much
better.With nothing to push her, she swings with the floor of ropes.There is no effort, no visible exertion.Not a single part of the
animal moves; and yet everything trembles.When calm is restored, she resumes her attitude, ceaselessly pondering
the harsh problem of life:

"Shall I dine to-day, or not?"Certain privileged beings, exempt from those anxieties, have food in
abundance and need not struggle to obtain it.Such is the Gentle, who
swims blissfully in the broth of the putrefying Adder.Others--and, by
a strange irony of fate, these are generally the most gifted--only
manage to eat by dint of craft and patience.You are of their company, O my industrious Epeirae!So that you may
dine, you spend your treasures of patience nightly; and often without
result.I sympathize with your woes, for I, who am as concerned as you
about my daily bread, I also doggedly spread my net, the net for
catching ideas, a more elusive and less substantial prize than the
Moth.The best part of life is not in the
present, still less in the past; it lies in the future, the domain of
hope.All day long, the sky, of a uniform grey, has appeared to be brewing a
storm.In spite of the threatened downpour, my neighbour, who is a
shrewd weather-prophet, has come out of the cypress-tree and begun to
renew her web at the regular hour.Her forecast is correct: it will be
a fine night.See, the steaming-pan of the clouds splits open; and,
through the apertures, the moon peeps, inquisitively.I too, lantern in
hand, am peeping.A gust of wind from the north clears the realms on
high; the sky becomes magnificent; perfect calm reigns below.The
Spider will dine to-day.What happens next, in an uncertain light, does not lend itself to
accurate observation.It is better to turn to those Garden Spiders who
never leave their web and who hunt mainly in the daytime.The Banded
and the Silky Epeira, both of whom live on the rosemaries in the
enclosure, shall show us in broad daylight the innermost details of the
tragedy.I myself place on the lime-snare a victim of my selecting.Its six legs
are caught without more ado.If the insect raises one of its tarsi and
pulls towards itself, the treacherous thread follows, unwinds slightly
and, without letting go or breaking, yields to the captive's desperate
jerks.Any limb released only tangles the others still more and is
speedily recaptured by the sticky matter.There is no means of escape,
except by smashing the trap with a sudden effort whereof even powerful
insects are not always capable.Warned by the shaking of the net, the Epeira hastens up; she turns
round about the quarry; she inspects it at a distance, so as to
ascertain the extent of the danger before attacking.The strength of
the snareling will decide the plan of campaign.Let us first suppose
the usual case, that of an average head of game, a Moth or Fly of some
sort.Facing her prisoner, the Spider contracts her abdomen slightly
and touches the insect for a moment with the end of her spinnerets;
then, with her front tarsi, she sets her victim spinning.The Squirrel,
in the moving cylinder of his cage, does not display a more graceful or
nimbler dexterity.A cross-bar of the sticky spiral serves as an axis
for the tiny machine, which turns, turns swiftly, like a spit.It is a
treat to the eyes to see it revolve.It is this: the brief
contact of the spinnerets has given a starting-point for a thread,
which the Spider must now draw from her silk warehouse and gradually
roll around the captive, so as to swathe him in a winding-sheet which
will overpower any effort made.It is the exact process employed in our
wire-mills: a motor-driven spool revolves and, by its action, draws the
wire through the narrow eyelet of a steel plate, making it of the
fineness required, and, with the same movement, winds it round and
round its collar.Even so with the Epeira's work.The Spider's front tarsi are the motor;
the revolving spool is the captured insect; the steel eyelet is the
aperture of the spinnerets.To bind the subject with precision and
dispatch nothing could be better than this inexpensive and highly
effective method.With a quick movement,
the Spider herself turns round about the motionless insect, crossing
the web first at the top and then at the bottom and gradually placing
the fastenings of her line.The great elasticity of the lime-threads
allows the Epeira to fling herself time after time right into the web
and to pass through it without damaging the net.Let us now suppose the case of some dangerous game: a Praying Mantis,
for instance, brandishing her lethal limbs, each hooked and fitted with
a double saw; an angry Hornet, darting her awful sting; a sturdy
Beetle, invincible under his horny armour.These are exceptional
morsels, hardly ever known to the Epeirae.Will they be accepted, if
supplied by my stratagems?The game is seen to be perilous of
approach and the Spider turns her back upon it instead of facing it;
she trains her rope-cannon upon it.Quickly the hind-legs draw from the
spinnerets something much better than single cords.The whole
silk-battery works at one and the same time, firing a regular volley of
ribbons and sheets, which a wide movement of the legs spreads fan-wise
and flings over the entangled prisoner.Guarding against sudden starts,
the Epeira casts her armfuls of bands on the front- and hind-parts,
over the legs and over the wings, here, there and everywhere,
extravagantly.The most fiery prey is promptly mastered under this
avalanche.In vain the Mantis tries to open her saw-toothed arm-guards;
in vain the Hornet makes play with her dagger; in vain the Beetle
stiffens his legs and arches his back: a fresh wave of threads swoops
down and paralyses every effort.The ancient retiarius, when pitted against a powerful wild beast,
appeared in the arena with a rope-net folded over his left shoulder.The man, with a sudden movement of his
right arm, cast the net after the manner of the fisherman; he covered
the beast and tangled it in the meshes.A thrust of the trident gave
the quietus to the vanquished foe.The Epeira acts in like fashion, with this advantage, that she is able
to renew her armful of fetters.Should the first not suffice, a second
instantly follows and another and yet another, until the reserves of
silk become exhausted.When all movement ceases under the snowy winding-sheet, the Spider goes
up to her bound prisoner.She has a better weapon than the bestiarius'
trident: she has her poison-fangs.She gnaws at the Locust, without
undue persistence, and then withdraws, leaving the torpid patient to
pine away.These lavished, far-flung ribbons threaten to exhaust the factory; it
would be much more economical to resort to the method of the spool;
but, to turn the machine, the Spider would have to go up to it and work
it with her leg.This is too risky; and hence the continuous spray of
silk, at a safe distance.When all is used up, there is more to come.Still, the Epeira seems concerned at this excessive outlay.When
circumstances permit, she gladly returns to the mechanism of the
revolving spool.I saw her practice this abrupt change of tactics on a
big Beetle, with a smooth, plump body, which lent itself admirably to
the rotary process.After depriving the beast of all power of movement,
she went up to it and turned her corpulent victim as she would have
done with a medium-sized Moth.But with the Praying Mantis, sticking out her long legs and her
spreading wings, rotation is no longer feasible.Then, until the quarry
is thoroughly subdued, the spray of bandages goes on continuously, even
to the point of drying up the silk glands.A capture of this kind is
ruinous.It is true that, except when I interfered, I have never seen
the Spider tackle that formidable provender.Be it feeble or strong, the game is now neatly trussed, by one of the
two methods.The bound insect is bitten,
without persistency and without any wound that shows.The Spider next
retires and allows the bite to act, which it soon does.If the victim be small, a Clothes-moth, for instance, it is consumed on
the spot, at the place where it was captured.But, for a prize of some
importance, on which she hopes to feast for many an hour, sometimes for
many a day, the Spider needs a sequestered dining-room, where there is
naught to fear from the stickiness of the network.Before going to it,
she first makes her prey turn in the converse direction to that of the
original rotation.Her object is to free the nearest spokes, which
supplied pivots for the machinery.They are essential factors which it
behoves her to keep intact, if need be by sacrificing a few cross-bars.It is done; the twisted ends are put back into position.The
well-trussed game is at last removed from the web and fastened on
behind with a thread.The Spider then marches in front and the load is
trundled across the web and hoisted to the resting-floor, which is both
an inspection-post and a dining-hall.When the Spider is of a species
that shuns the light and possesses a telegraph-line, she mounts to her
daytime hiding-place along this line, with the game bumping against her
heels.While she is refreshing herself, let us enquire into the effects of the
little bite previously administered to the silk-swathed captive.Does
the Spider kill the patient with a view to avoiding unseasonable jerks,
protests so disagreeable at dinner-time?In the first place, the attack is so much veiled as to have all the
appearance of a mere kiss.Besides, it is made anywhere, at the first
spot that offers.The expert slayers employ methods of the highest
precision: they give a stab in the neck, or under the throat; they
wound the cervical nerve-centres, the seat of energy.The paralysers,
those accomplished anatomists, poison the motor nerve-centres, of which
they know the number and position.The Epeira possesses none of this
fearsome knowledge.She inserts her fangs at random, as the Bee does
her sting.She does not select one spot rather than another; she bites
indifferently at whatever comes within reach.This being so, her poison
would have to possess unparalleled virulence to produce a corpse-like
inertia no matter which the point attacked.I can scarcely believe in
instantaneous death resulting from the bite, especially in the case of
insects, with their highly-resistant organisms.Besides, is it really a corpse that the Epeira wants, she who feeds on
blood much more than on flesh?It were to her advantage to suck a live
body, wherein the flow of the liquids, set in movement by the pulsation
of the dorsal vessel, that rudimentary heart of insects, must act more
freely than in a lifeless body, with its stagnant fluids.The game
which the Spider means to suck dry might very well not be dead.I place some Locusts of different species on the webs in my menagerie,
one on this, another on that.The Spider comes rushing up, binds the
prey, nibbles at it gently and withdraws, waiting for the bite to take
effect.I then take the insect and carefully strip it of its silken
shroud.The Locust is not dead; far from it; one would even think that
he had suffered no harm.I examine the released prisoner through the
lens in vain; I can see no trace of a wound.Can he be unscathed, in spite of the sort of kiss which I saw given to
him just now?You would be ready to say so, judging by the furious way
in which he kicks in my fingers.Nevertheless, when put on the ground,
he walks awkwardly, he seems reluctant to hop.Perhaps it is a
temporary trouble, caused by his terrible excitement in the web.It
looks as though it would soon pass.I lodge my Locusts in cages, with a lettuce-leaf to console them for
their trials; but they will not be comforted.A day elapses, followed
by a second.Not one of them touches the leaf of salad; their appetite
has disappeared.Their movements become more uncertain, as though
hampered by irresistible torpor.On the second day they are dead,
everyone irrecoverably dead.The Epeira, therefore, does not incontinently kill her prey with her
delicate bite; she poisons it so as to produce a gradual weakness,
which gives the blood-sucker ample time to drain her victim, without
the least risk, before the rigor mortis stops the flow of moisture.The meal lasts quite twenty-four hours, if the joint be large; and to
the very end the butchered insect retains a remnant of life, a
favourable condition for the exhausting of the juices.Once again, we
see a skilful method of slaughter, very different from the tactics in
use among the expert paralysers or slayers.Here there is no display of
anatomical science.Unacquainted with the patient's structure, the
Spider stabs at random.The virulence of the poison does the rest.There are, however, some very few cases in which the bite is speedily
mortal.My notes speak of an Angular Epeira grappling with the largest
Dragon-fly in my district (Aeshna grandis, Lin.)I myself had entangled
in the web this head of big game, which is not often captured by the
Epeirae.The net shakes violently, seems bound to break its moorings.The Spider rushes from her leafy villa, runs boldly up to the giantess,
flings a single bundle of ropes at her and, without further
precautions, grips her with her legs, tries to subdue her and then digs
her fangs into the Dragon-fly's back.The bite is prolonged in such a
way as to astonish me.This is not the perfunctory kiss with which I am
already familiar; it is a deep, determined wound.After striking her
blow, the Spider retires to a certain distance and waits for her poison
to take effect.Laid upon my table and left alone for twenty-four hours, she makes not
the slightest movement.A prick of which my lens cannot see the marks,
so sharp-pointed are the Epeira's weapons, was enough, with a little
insistence, to kill the powerful animal.Proportionately, the
Rattlesnake, the Horned Viper, the Trigonocephalus and other ill-famed
serpents produce less paralysing effects upon their victims.And these Epeirae, so terrible to insects, I am able to handle without
any fear.If I persuaded them to bite me,
what would happen to me?We have more cause to dread
the sting of a nettle than the dagger which is fatal to Dragon-flies.The same virus acts differently upon this organism and that, is
formidable here and quite mild there.What kills the insect may easily
be harmless to us.Let us not, however, generalize too far.The
Narbonne Lycosa, that other enthusiastic insect-huntress, would make us
pay dearly if we attempted to take liberties with her.It is not uninteresting to watch the Epeira at dinner.I light upon
one, the Banded Epeira, at the moment, about three o'clock in the
afternoon, when she has captured a Locust.Planted in the centre of the
web, on her resting-floor, she attacks the venison at the joint of a
haunch.There is no movement, not even of the mouth-parts, so far as I
am able to discover.The mouth lingers, close-applied, at the point
originally bitten.There are no intermittent mouthfuls, with the
mandibles moving backwards and forwards.I
visit her for the last time at nine o'clock in the evening.Matters
stand exactly as they did: after six hours' consumption, the mouth is
still sucking at the lower end of the right haunch.The fluid contents
of the victim are transferred to the ogress's belly, I know not how.Next morning, the Spider is still at table.Naught remains of the Locust but his skin, hardly altered in shape, but
utterly drained and perforated in several places.The method,
therefore, was changed during the night.To extract the non-fluent
residue, the viscera and muscles, the stiff cuticle had to be tapped
here, there and elsewhere, after which the tattered husk, placed bodily
in the press of the mandibles, would have been chewed, re-chewed and
finally reduced to a pill, which the sated Spider throws up.This would
have been the end of the victim, had I not taken it away before the
time.Whether she wound or kill, the Epeira bites her captive somewhere or
other, no matter where.This is an excellent method on her part,
because of the variety of the game that comes her way.I see her
accepting with equal readiness whatever chance may send her:
Butterflies and Dragon-flies, Flies and Wasps, small Dung-beetles and
Locusts.If I offer her a Mantis, a Bumble-bee, an Anoxia--the
equivalent of the common Cockchafer--and other dishes probably unknown
to her race, she accepts all and any, large and small, thin-skinned and
horny-skinned, that which goes afoot and that which takes winged
flight.She is omnivorous, she preys on everything, down to her own
kind, should the occasion offer.Had she to operate according to individual structure, she would need an
anatomical dictionary; and instinct is essentially unfamiliar with
generalities: its knowledge is always confined to limited points.The
Cerceres know their Weevils and their Buprestis-beetles absolutely; the
Sphex their Grasshoppers, their Crickets and their Locusts; the Scoliae
their Cetonia- and Oryctes-grubs.(The Scolia is a Digger-wasp, like
the Cerceris and the Sphex, and feeds her larvae on the grubs of the
Cetonia, or Rose-chafer, and the Oryctes, or
Rhinoceros-beetle.--Translator's Note.)Each has her own victim and knows nothing of any of the others.The same exclusive tastes prevail among the slayers.Let us remember,
in this connection, Philanthus apivorus and, especially, the Thomisus,
the comely Spider who cuts Bees' throats.They understand the fatal
blow, either in the neck or under the chin, a thing which the Epeira
does not understand; but, just because of this talent, they are
specialists.Animals are a little like ourselves: they excel in an art only on
condition of specializing in it.The Epeira, who, being omnivorous, is
obliged to generalize, abandons scientific methods and makes up for
this by distilling a poison capable of producing torpor and even death,
no matter what the point attacked.Recognizing the large variety of game, we wonder how the Epeira manages
not to hesitate amid those many diverse forms, how, for instance, she
passes from the Locust to the Butterfly, so different in appearance.To
attribute to her as a guide an extensive zoological knowledge were
wildly in excess of what we may reasonably expect of her poor
intelligence.The thing moves, therefore it is worth catching: this
formula seems to sum up the Spider's wisdom.Of the six Garden Spiders that form the object of my observations, two
only, the Banded and the Silky Epeira, remain constantly in their webs,
even under the blinding rays of a fierce sun.The others, as a rule, do
not show themselves until nightfall.At some distance from the net they
have a rough-and-ready retreat in the brambles, an ambush made of a few
leaves held together by stretched threads.It is here that, for the
most part, they remain in the daytime, motionless and sunk in
meditation.But the shrill light that vexes them is the joy of the fields.At such
times the Locust hops more nimbly than ever, more gaily skims the
Dragon-fly.Besides, the limy web, despite the rents suffered during
the night, is still in serviceable condition.If some giddy-pate allow
himself to be caught, will the Spider, at the distance whereto she has
retired, be unable to take advantage of the windfall?The alarm is given by the vibration of the web, much more than by the
sight of the captured object.I lay upon a Banded Epeira's lime-threads a Locust that second
asphyxiated with carbon disulphide.The carcass is placed in front, or
behind, or at either side of the Spider, who sits moveless in the
centre of the net.If the test is to be applied to a species with a
daytime hiding-place amid the foliage, the dead Locust is laid on the
web, more or less near the centre, no matter how.The Epeira remains in her
motionless attitude, even when the morsel is at a short distance in
front of her.She is indifferent to the presence of the game, does not
seem to perceive it, so much so that she ends by wearing out my
patience.Then, with a long straw, which enables me to conceal myself
slightly, I set the dead insect trembling.The Banded Epeira and the Silky Epeira hasten to
the central floor; the others come down from the branch; all go to the
Locust, swathe him with tape, treat him, in short, as they would treat
a live prey captured under normal conditions.It took the shaking of
the web to decide them to attack.Perhaps the grey colour of the Locust is not sufficiently conspicuous
to attract attention by itself.Then let us try red, the brightest
colour to our retina and probably also to the Spiders'.None of the
game hunted by the Epeirae being clad in scarlet, I make a small bundle
out of red wool, a bait of the size of a Locust.As long as the parcel is stationary, the Spider
is not roused; but, the moment it trembles, stirred by my straw, she
runs up eagerly.There are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and,
without further enquiries, swathe it in silk after the manner of the
usual game.They even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait,
following the rule of the preliminary poisoning.Then and then only the
mistake is recognized and the tricked Spider retires and does not come
back, unless it be long afterwards, when she flings the lumbersome
object out of the web.Like the others, these hasten to the
red-woollen lure, which my straw insidiously keeps moving; they come
from their tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the
web; they explore it with their palpi and their legs; but, soon
perceiving that the thing is valueless, they are careful not to spend
their silk on useless bonds.Still, the clever ones, like the silly ones, run even from a distance,
from their leafy ambush.Before recognizing their mistake, they have to hold the object between
their legs and even to nibble at it a little.At a hand's-breadth's distance, the lifeless prey,
unable to shake the web, remains unperceived.Besides, in many cases,
the hunting takes place in the dense darkness of the night, when sight,
even if it were good, would not avail.If the eyes are insufficient guides, even close at hand, how will it be
when the prey has to be spied from afar?In that case, an intelligence
apparatus for long-distance work becomes indispensable.We have no
difficulty in detecting the apparatus.Let us look attentively behind the web of any Epeira with a daytime
hiding-place: we shall see a thread that starts from the centre of the
network, ascends in a slanting line outside the plane of the web and
ends at the ambush where the Spider lurks all day.Except at the
central point, there is no connection between this thread and the rest
of the work, no interweaving with the scaffolding-threads.Free of
impediment, the line runs straight from the centre of the net to the
ambush-tent.The Angular Epeira,
settled high up in the trees, has shown me some as long as eight or
nine feet.There is no doubt that this slanting line is a foot-bridge which allows
the Spider to repair hurriedly to the web, when summoned by urgent
business, and then, when her round is finished, to return to her hut.In fact, it is the road which I see her follow, in going and coming.No; for, if the Epeira had no aim in view but a means
of rapid transit between her tent and the net, the foot-bridge would be
fastened to the upper edge of the web.The journey would be shorter and
the <DW72> less steep.Why, moreover, does this line always start in the centre of the sticky
network and nowhere else?Because that is the point where the spokes
meet and, therefore, the common centre of vibration.Anything that
moves upon the web sets it shaking.All then that is needed is a thread
issuing from this central point to convey to a distance the news of a
prey struggling in some part or other of the net.The slanting cord,
extending outside the plane of the web, is more than a foot-bridge: it
is, above all, a signalling-apparatus, a telegraph-wire.Caught in the
sticky toils, he plunges about.Forthwith, the Spider issues
impetuously from her hut, comes down the foot-bridge, makes a rush for
the Locust, wraps him up and operates on him according to rule.Soon
after, she hoists him, fastened by a line to her spinneret, and drags
him to her hiding-place, where a long banquet will be held.So far,
nothing new: things happen as usual.I leave the Spider to mind her own affairs for some days before I
interfere with her.I again propose to give her a Locust; but this time
I first cut the signalling-thread with a touch of the scissors, without
shaking any part of the edifice.Complete success: the entangled insect struggles, sets the net
quivering; the Spider, on her side, does not stir, as though heedless
of events.The idea might occur to one that, in this business, the Epeira stays
motionless in her cabin since she is prevented from hurrying down,
because the foot-bridge is broken.Let us undeceive ourselves: for one
road open to her there are a hundred, all ready to bring her to the
place where her presence is now required.The network is fastened to
the branches by a host of lines, all of them very easy to cross.Well,
the Epeira embarks upon none of them, but remains moveless and
self-absorbed.Because her telegraph, being out of order, no longer tells her of
the shaking of the web.The captured prey is too far off for her to see
it; she is all unwitting.A good hour passes, with the Locust still
kicking, the Spider impassive, myself watching.Nevertheless, in the
end, the Epeira wakes up: no longer feeling the signalling-thread,
broken by my scissors, as taut as usual under her legs, she comes to
look into the state of things.The web is reached, without the least
difficulty, by one of the lines of the framework, the first that
offers.The Locust is then perceived and forthwith enswathed, after
which the signalling-thread is remade, taking the place of the one
which I have broken.Along this road the Spider goes home, dragging her
prey behind her.My neighbour, the mighty Angular Epeira, with her telegraph-wire nine
feet long, has even better things in store for me.One morning I find
her web, which is now deserted, almost intact, a proof that the night's
hunting has not been good.With a piece of
game for a bait, I hope to bring her down from her lofty retreat.I entangle in the web a rare morsel, a Dragon-fly, who struggles
desperately and sets the whole net a-shaking.The other, up above,
leaves her lurking-place amid the cypress-foliage, strides swiftly down
along her telegraph-wire, comes to the Dragon-fly, trusses her and at
once climbs home again by the same road, with her prize dangling at her
heels by a thread.The final sacrifice will take place in the quiet of
the leafy sanctuary.A few days later I renew my experiment under the same conditions, but,
this time, I first cut the signalling-thread.In vain I select a large
Dragon-fly, a very restless prisoner; in vain I exert my patience: the
Spider does not come down all day.Her telegraph being broken, she
receives no notice of what is happening nine feet below.The entangled
morsel remains where it lies, not despised, but unknown.At nightfall
the Epeira leaves her cabin, passes over the ruins of her web, finds
the Dragon-fly and eats him on the spot, after which the net is
renewed.The Epeirae, who occupy a distant retreat by day, cannot do without a
private wire that keeps them in permanent communication with the
deserted web.All of them have one, in point of fact, but only when age
comes, age prone to rest and to long slumbers.In their youth, the
Epeirae, who are then very wide awake, know nothing of the art of
telegraphy.Besides, their web, a short-lived work whereof hardly a
trace remains on the morrow, does not allow of this kind of industry.It is no use going to the expense of a signalling-apparatus for a
ruined snare wherein nothing can now be caught.Only the old Spiders,
meditating or dozing in their green tent, are warned from afar, by
telegraph, of what takes place on the web.To save herself from keeping a close watch that would degenerate into
drudgery and to remain alive to events even when resting, with her back
turned on the net, the ambushed Spider always has her foot upon the
telegraph-wire.Of my observations on this subject, let me relate the
following, which will be sufficient for our purpose.An Angular Epeira, with a remarkably fine belly, has spun her web
between two laurustine-shrubs, covering a width of nearly a yard.The
sun beats upon the snare, which is abandoned long before dawn.The
Spider is in her day manor, a resort easily discovered by following the
telegraph-wire.It is a vaulted chamber of dead leaves, joined together
with a few bits of silk.The refuge is deep: the Spider disappears in
it entirely, all but her rounded hind-quarters, which bar the entrance
to her donjon.With her front half plunged into the back of her hut, the Epeira
certainly cannot see her web.Even if she had good sight, instead of
being purblind, her position could not possibly allow her to keep the
prey in view.Does she give up hunting during this period of bright
sunlight?One of her hind-legs is stretched outside the leafy cabin;
and the signalling-thread ends just at the tip of that leg.Whoso has
not seen the Epeira in this attitude, with her hand, so to speak, on
the telegraph-receiver, knows nothing of one of the most curious
instances of animal cleverness.Let any game appear upon the scene; and
the slumberer, forthwith aroused by means of the leg receiving the
vibrations, hastens up.A Locust whom I myself lay on the web procures
her this agreeable shock and what follows.If she is satisfied with her
bag, I am still more satisfied with what I have learnt.The different parts
of the framework, tossed and teased by the eddying air-currents, cannot
fail to transmit their vibration to the signalling-thread.Nevertheless, the Spider does not quit her hut and remains indifferent
to the commotion prevailing in the net.Her line, therefore, is
something better than a bell-rope that pulls and communicates the
impulse given: it is a telephone capable, like our own, of transmitting
infinitesimal waves of sound.Clutching her telephone-wire with a toe,
the Spider listens with her leg; she perceives the innermost
vibrations; she distinguishes between the vibration proceeding from a
prisoner and the mere shaking caused by the wind.A wasp-like garb of motley black and yellow; a slender and graceful
figure; wings not spread out flat, when resting, but folded lengthwise
in two; the abdomen a sort of chemist's retort, which swells into a
gourd and is fastened to the thorax by a long neck, first distending
into a pear, then shrinking to a thread; a leisurely and silent flight;
lonely habits.There we have a summary sketch of the Eumenes.My part
of the country possesses two species: the larger, Eumenes Amedei, Lep.,
measures nearly an inch in length; the other, Eumenes pomiformis,
Fabr., is a reduction of the first to the scale of one-half.(I include
three species promiscuously under this one name, that is to say,
Eumenes pomiformis, Fabr., E. bipunctis, Sauss., and E. dubius, Sauss.As I did not distinguish between them in my first investigations, which
date a very long time back, it is not possible for me to ascribe to
each of them its respective nest.But their habits are the same, for
which reason this confusion does not injuriously affect the order of
ideas in the present chapter.--Author's Note.)Similar in form and colouring, both possess a like talent for
architecture; and this talent is expressed in a work of the highest
perfection which charms the most untutored eye.The Eumenes follow the profession of arms, which is
unfavourable to artistic effort; they stab a prey with their sting;
they pillage and plunder.They are predatory Hymenoptera, victualling
their grubs with caterpillars.It will be interesting to compare their
habits with those of the operator on the Grey Worm.(Ammophila hirsuta,
who hunts the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of Noctua segetum, the Dart or
Turnip Moth.--Translator's Note.)Though the quarry--caterpillars in
either case--remain the same, perhaps instinct, which is liable to vary
with the species, has fresh glimpses in store for us.Besides, the
edifice built by the Eumenes in itself deserves inspection.The Hunting Wasps whose story we have described in former volumes are
wonderfully well versed in the art of wielding the lancet; they astound
us with their surgical methods, which they seem to have learnt from
some physiologist who allows nothing to escape him; but those skilful
slayers have no merit as builders of dwelling-houses.What is their
home, in point of fact?An underground passage, with a cell at the end
of it; a gallery, an excavation, a shapeless cave.It is miner's work,
navvy's work: vigorous sometimes, artistic never.They use the pick-axe
for loosening, the crowbar for shifting, the rake for extracting the
materials, but never the trowel for laying.Now in the Eumenes we see
real masons, who build their houses bit by bit with stone and mortar
and run them up in the open, either on the firm rock or on the shaky
support of a bough.Hunting alternates with architecture; the insect is
a Nimrod or a Vitruvius by turns.(Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman
architect and engineer.--Translator's Note.)And, first of all, what sites do these builders select for their homes?Should you pass some little garden-wall, facing south, in a
sun-scorched corner, look at the stones that are not covered with
plaster, look at them one by one, especially the largest; examine the
masses of boulders, at no great height from the ground, where the
fierce rays have heated them to the temperature of a Turkish bath; and,
perhaps, if you seek long enough, you will light upon the structure of
Eumenes Amedei.The insect is scarce and lives apart; a meeting is an
event upon which we must not count with too great confidence.It is an
African species and loves the heat that ripens the carob and the date.It haunts the sunniest spots and selects rocks or firm stones as a
foundation for its nest.Sometimes also, but seldom, it copies the
Chalicodoma of the Walls and builds upon an ordinary pebble.(Or
Mason-bee.--Translator's Note.)Eumenes pomiformis is much more common and is comparatively indifferent
to the nature of the foundation whereon she erects her cells.She
builds on walls, on isolated stones, on the wood of the inner surface
of half-closed shutters; or else she adopts an aerial base, the slender
twig of a shrub, the withered sprig of a plant of some sort.Less
chilly than her African cousin, she does not shun the unprotected
spaces exposed to every wind that blows.When erected on a horizontal surface, where nothing interferes with it,
the structure of Eumenes Amedei is a symmetrical cupola, a spherical
skull-cap, with, at the top, a narrow passage just wide enough for the
insect, and surmounted by a neatly funnelled neck.It suggests the
round hut of the Eskimo or of the ancient Gael, with its central
chimney.Two centimetres and a half (.97 inch.--Translator's Note.),
more or less, represent the diameter, and two centimetres the height.(.78 inch.--Translator's Note.)When the support is a perpendicular
plane, the building still retains the domed shape, but the entrance-
and exit-funnel opens at the side, upwards.The floor of this apartment
calls for no labour: it is supplied direct by the bare stone.Having chosen the site, the builder erects a circular fence about three
millimetres thick.(.118 inch.--Translator's Note.)The materials
consist of mortar and small stones.The insect selects its stone-quarry
in some well-trodden path, on some neighbouring road, at the driest,
hardest spots.With its mandibles, it scrapes together a small quantity
of dust and saturates it with saliva until the whole becomes a regular
hydraulic mortar which soon sets and is no longer susceptible to water.The Mason-bees have shown us a similar exploitation of the beaten paths
and of the road-mender's macadam.All these open-air builders, all
these erectors of monuments exposed to wind and weather require an
exceedingly dry stone-dust; otherwise the material, already moistened
with water, would not properly absorb the liquid that is to give it
cohesion; and the edifice would soon be wrecked by the rains.They
possess the sense of discrimination of the plasterer, who rejects
plaster injured by damp.We shall see presently how the insects that
build under shelter avoid this laborious macadam-scraping and give the
preference to fresh earth already reduced to a paste by its own
dampness.When common lime answers our purpose, we do not trouble about
Roman cement.Now Eumenes Amedei requires a first-class cement, even
better than that of the Chalicodoma of the Walls, for the work, when
finished, does not receive the thick covering wherewith the Mason-bee
protects her cluster of cells.And therefore the cupola-builder, as
often as she can, uses the highway as her stone-pit.These are bits of gravel of an
almost unvarying size--that of a peppercorn--but of a shape and kind
differing greatly, according to the places worked.Some are
sharp-cornered, with facets determined by chance fractures; some are
round, polished by friction under water.Some are of limestone, others
of silicic matter.The favourite stones, when the neighbourhood of the
nest permits, are little nodules of quartz, smooth and semitransparent.The insect weighs them, so to say,
measures them with the compass of its mandibles and does not accept
them until after recognizing in them the requisite qualities of size
and hardness.A circular fence, we were saying, is begun on the bare rock.Before the
mortar sets, which does not take long, the mason sticks a few stones
into the soft mass, as the work advances.She dabs them half-way into
the cement, so as to leave them jutting out to a large extent, without
penetrating to the inside, where the wall must remain smooth for the
sake of the larva's comfort.If necessary, a little plaster is added,
to tone down the inner protuberances.The solidly embedded stonework
alternates with the pure mortarwork, of which each fresh course
receives its facing of tiny encrusted pebbles.As the edifice is
raised, the builder <DW72>s the construction a little towards the centre
and fashions the curve which will give the spherical shape.We employ
arched centrings to support the masonry of a dome while building: the
Eumenes, more daring than we, erects her cupola without any
scaffolding.A round orifice is contrived at the summit; and, on this orifice, rises
a funnelled mouthpiece built of pure cement.It might be the graceful
neck of some Etruscan vase.When the cell is victualled and the egg
laid, this mouthpiece is closed with a cement plug; and in this plug is
set a little pebble, one alone, no more: the ritual never varies.This
work of rustic architecture has naught to fear from the inclemency of
the weather; it does not yield to the pressure of the fingers; it
resists the knife that attempts to remove it without breaking it.Its
nipple shape and the bits of gravel wherewith it bristles all over the
outside remind one of certain cromlechs of olden time, of certain
tumuli whose domes are strewn with Cyclopean stones.Such is the appearance of the edifice when the cell stands alone; but
the Hymenopteron nearly always fixes other domes against her first, to
the number of five, six, or more.This shortens the labour by allowing
her to use the same partition for two adjoining rooms.The original
elegant symmetry is lost and the whole now forms a cluster which, at
first sight, appears to be merely a clod of dry mud, sprinkled with
tiny pebbles.But let us examine the shapeless mass more closely and we
shall perceive the number of chambers composing the habitation with the
funnelled mouths, each quite distinct and each furnished with its
gravel stopper set in the cement.The Chalicodoma of the Walls employs the same building methods as
Eumenes Amedei: in the courses of cement she fixes, on the outside,
small stones of minor bulk.Her work begins by being a turret of rustic
art, not without a certain prettiness; then, when the cells are placed
side by side, the whole construction degenerates into a lump governed
apparently by no architectural rule.Moreover, the Mason-bee covers her
mass of cells with a thick layer of cement, which conceals the original
rockwork edifice.The Eumenes does not resort to this general coating:
her building is too strong to need it; she leaves the pebbly facings
uncovered, as well as the entrances to the cells.The two sorts of
nests, although constructed of similar materials, are therefore easily
distinguished.The Eumenes' cupola is the work of an artist; and the artist would be
sorry to cover his masterpiece with whitewash.I crave forgiveness for
a suggestion which I advance with all the reserve befitting so delicate
a subject.Would it not be possible for the cromlech-builder to take a
pride in her work, to look upon it with some affection and to feel
gratified by this evidence of her cleverness?Might there not be an
insect science of aesthetics?I seem at least to catch a glimpse, in
the Eumenes, of a propensity to beautify her work.The nest must be,
before all, a solid habitation, an inviolable stronghold; but, should
ornament intervene without jeopardizing the power of resistance, will
the worker remain indifferent to it?The orifice at the top, if left as a mere
hole, would suit the purpose quite as well as an elaborate door: the
insect would lose nothing in regard to facilities for coming and going
and would gain by shortening the labour.Yet we find, on the contrary,
the mouth of an amphora, gracefully curved, worthy of a potter's wheel.A choice cement and careful work are necessary for the confection of
its slender, funnelled shaft.Why this nice finish, if the builder be
wholly absorbed in the solidity of her work?Here is another detail: among the bits of gravel employed for the outer
covering of the cupola, grains of quartz predominate.They are polished
and translucent; they glitter slightly and please the eye.Why are
these little pebbles preferred to chips of lime-stone, when both
materials are found in equal abundance around the nest?A yet more remarkable feature: we find pretty often, encrusted on the
dome, a few tiny, empty snail-shells, bleached by the sun.The species
usually selected by the Eumenes is one of the smaller Helices--Helix
strigata--frequent on our parched <DW72>s.I have seen nests where this
Helix took the place of pebbles almost entirely.They were like boxes
made of shells, the work of a patient hand.Certain Australian birds, notably the
Bower-birds, build themselves covered walks, or playhouses, with
interwoven twigs, and decorate the two entrances to the portico by
strewing the threshold with anything that they can find in the shape of
glittering, polished, or bright- objects.Every door-sill is a
cabinet of curiosities where the collector gathers smooth pebbles,
variegated shells, empty snail-shells, parrot's feathers, bones that
have come to look like sticks of ivory.The odds and ends mislaid by
man find a home in the bird's museum, where we see pipe-stems, metal
buttons, strips of cotton stuff and stone axe-heads.The collection at either entrance to the bower is large enough to fill
half a bushel.As these objects are of no use to the bird, its only
motive for accumulating them must be an art-lover's hobby.Our common
Magpie has similar tastes: any shiny thing that he comes upon he picks
up, hides and hoards.Well, the Eumenes, who shares this passion for bright pebbles and empty
snail-shells, is the Bower-bird of the insect world; but she is a more
practical collector, knows how to combine the useful and the ornamental
and employs her finds in the construction of her nest, which is both a
fortress and a museum.When she finds nodules of translucent quartz,
she rejects everything else: the building will be all the prettier for
them.When she comes across a little white shell, she hastens to
beautify her dome with it; should fortune smile and empty snail-shells
abound, she encrusts the whole fabric with them, until it becomes the
supreme expression of her artistic taste.The nest of Eumenes pomiformis is the size of an average cherry and
constructed of pure mortar, without the least outward pebblework.Its
shape is exactly similar to that which we have just described.When
built upon a horizontal base of sufficient extent, it is a dome with a
central neck, funnelled like the mouth of an urn.But when the
foundation is reduced to a mere point, as on the twig of a shrub, the
nest becomes a spherical capsule, always, of course, surmounted by a
neck.It is then a miniature specimen of exotic pottery, a paunchy
alcarraza.Its thickens is very slight, less than that of a sheet of
paper; it crushes under the least effort of the fingers.It displays wrinkles and seams, due to the different
courses of mortar, or else knotty protuberances distributed almost
concentrically.Both Hymenoptera accumulate caterpillars in their coffers, whether
domes or jars.Let us give an abstract of the bill of fare.These
documents, for all their dryness, possess a value; they will enable
whoso cares to interest himself in the Eumenes to perceive to what
extent instinct varies the diet, according to the place and season.The
food is plentiful, but lacks variety.It consists of tiny caterpillars,
by which I mean the grubs of small Butterflies.We learn this from the
structure, for we observe in the prey selected by either Hymenopteran
the usual caterpillar organism.The body is composed of twelve
segments, not including the head.The first three have true legs, the
next two are legless, then come two segments with prolegs, two legless
segments and, lastly, a terminal segment with prolegs.It is exactly
the same structure which we saw in the Ammophila's Grey Worm.My old notes give the following description of the caterpillars found
in the nest of Eumenes Amedei: "a pale green or, less often, a
yellowish body, covered with short white hairs; head wider than the
front segment, dead-black and also bristling with hairs.Length: 16 to
18 millimetres (.63 to.7 inch.--Translator's Note.); width: about 3
millimetres."(.12 inch.--Translator's Note.)A quarter of a century
and more has elapsed since I jotted down this descriptive sketch; and
to-day, at Serignan, I find in the Eumenes' larder the same game which
I noticed long ago at Carpentras.Time and distance have not altered
the nature of the provisions.The number of morsels served for the meal of each larva interests us
more than the quality.In the cells of Eumenes Amedei, I find sometimes
five caterpillars and sometimes ten, which means a difference of a
hundred per cent in the quantity of the food, for the morsels are of
exactly the same size in both cases.Why this unequal supply, which
gives a double portion to one larva and a single portion to another?The diners have the same appetite: what one nurseling demands a second
must demand, unless we have here a different menu, according to the
sexes.In the perfect stage the males are smaller than the females, are
hardly half as much in weight or volume.The amount of victuals,
therefore, required to bring them to their final development may be
reduced by one-half.In that case, the well-stocked cells belong to
females; the others, more meagrely supplied, belong to males.But the egg is laid when the provisions are stored; and this egg has a
determined sex, though the most minute examination is not able to
discover the differences which will decide the hatching of a female or
a male.We are therefore needs driven to this strange conclusion: the
mother knows beforehand the sex of the egg which she is about to lay;
and this knowledge allows her to fill the larder according to the
appetite of the future grub.What a strange world, so wholly different
from ours!We fall back upon a special sense to explain the Ammophila's
hunting; what can we fall back upon to account for this intuition of
the future?Can the theory of chances play a part in the hazy problem?If nothing is logically arranged with a foreseen object, how is this
clear vision of the invisible acquired?The capsules of Eumenes pomiformis are literally crammed with game.It
is true that the morsels are very small.My notes speak of fourteen
green caterpillars in one cell and sixteen in a second cell.I have no
other information about the integral diet of this Wasp, whom I have
neglected somewhat, preferring to study her cousin, the builder of
rockwork domes.As the two sexes differ in size, although to a lesser
degree than in the case of Eumenes Amedei, I am inclined to think that
those two well-filled cells belonged to females and that the males'
cells must have a less sumptuous table.Not having seen for myself, I
am content to set down this mere suspicion.What I have seen and often seen is the pebbly nest, with the larva
inside and the provisions partly consumed.To continue the rearing at
home and follow my charge's progress from day to day was a business
which I could not resist; besides, as far as I was able to see, it was
easily managed.I had had some practice in this foster-father's trade;
my association with the Bembex, the Ammophila, the Sphex (three species
of Digger-wasps.--Translator's Note.)and many others had turned me
into a passable insect-rearer.I was no novice in the art of dividing
an old pen-box into compartments in which I laid a bed of sand and, on
this bed, the larva and her provisions delicately removed from the
maternal cell.Success was almost certain at each attempt: I used to
watch the larvae at their meals, I saw my nurselings grow up and spin
their cocoons.Relying upon the experience thus gained, I reckoned upon
success in raising my Eumenes.The results, however, in no way answered to my expectations.All my
endeavours failed; and the larva allowed itself to die a piteous death
without touching its provisions.I ascribed my reverse to this, that and the other cause: perhaps I had
injured the frail grub when demolishing the fortress; a splinter of
masonry had bruised it when I forced open the hard dome with my knife;
a too sudden exposure to the sun had surprised it when I withdrew it
from the darkness of its cell; the open air might have dried up its
moisture.I did the best I could to remedy all these probable reasons
of failure.I went to work with every possible caution in breaking open
the home; I cast the shadow of my body over the nest, to save the grub
from sunstroke; I at once transferred larva and provisions into a glass
tube and placed this tube in a box which I carried in my hand, to
minimize the jolting on the journey.Nothing was of avail: the larva,
when taken from its dwelling, always allowed itself to pine away.For a long time I persisted in explaining my want of success by the
difficulties attending the removal.Eumenes Amedei's cell is a strong
casket which cannot be forced without sustaining a shock; and the
demolition of a work of this kind entails such varied accidents that we
are always liable to think that the worm has been bruised by the
wreckage.As for carrying home the nest intact on its support, with a
view to opening it with greater care than is permitted by a
rough-and-ready operation in the fields, that is out of the question:
the nest nearly always stands on an immovable rock or on some big stone
forming part of a wall.If I failed in my attempts at rearing, it was
because the larva had suffered when I was breaking up her house.The
reason seemed a good one; and I let it go at that.In the end, another idea occurred to me and made me doubt whether my
rebuffs were always due to clumsy accidents.The Eumenes' cells are
crammed with game: there are ten caterpillars in the cell of Eumenes
Amedei and fifteen in that of Eumenes pomiformis.These caterpillars,
stabbed no doubt, but in a manner unknown to me, are not entirely
motionless.The mandibles seize upon what is presented to them, the
body buckles and unbuckles, the hinder half lashes out briskly when
stirred with the point of a needle.At what spot is the egg laid amid
that swarming mass, where thirty mandibles can make a hole in it, where
a hundred and twenty pairs of legs can tear it?When the victuals
consist of a single head of game, these perils do not exist; and the
egg is laid on the victim not at hazard, but upon a judiciously chosen
spot.Thus, for instance, Ammophila hirsuta fixes hers, by one end,
cross-wise, on the Grey Worm, on the side of the first prolegged
segment.The eggs hang over the caterpillar's back, away from the legs,
whose proximity might be dangerous.The worm, moreover, stung in the
greater number of its nerve-centres, lies on one side, motionless and
incapable of bodily contortions or said an jerks of its hinder
segments.If the mandibles try to snap, if the legs give a kick or two,
they find nothing in front of them: the Ammophila's egg is at the
opposite side.The tiny grub is thus able, as soon as it hatches, to
dig into the giant's belly in full security.How different are the conditions in the Eumenes' cell.The caterpillars
are imperfectly paralysed, perhaps because they have received but a
single stab; they toss about when touched with a pin; they are bound to
wriggle when bitten by the larva.If the egg is laid on one of them,
the first morsel will, I admit, be consumed without danger, on
condition that the point of attack be wisely chosen; but there remain
others which are not deprived of every means of defence.Let a movement
take place in the mass; and the egg, shifted from the upper layer, will
tumble into a pitfall of legs and mandibles.The least thing is enough
to jeopardize its existence; and this least thing has every chance of
being brought about in the disordered heap of caterpillars.The egg, a
tiny cylinder, transparent as crystal, is extremely delicate: a touch
withers it, the least pressure crushes it.No, its place is not in the mass of provisions, for the caterpillars, I
repeat, are not sufficiently harmless.Their paralysis is incomplete,
as is proved by their contortions when I irritate them and shown, on
the other hand, by a very important fact.I have sometimes taken from
Eumenes Amedei's cell a few heads of game half transformed into
chrysalids.It is evident that the transformation was effected in the
cell itself and, therefore, after the operation which the Wasp had
performed upon them.I cannot say
precisely, never having seen the huntress at work.The sting most
certainly has played its part; but where?What we are able to declare is that the torpor is not
very deep, inasmuch as the patient sometimes retains enough vitality to
shed its skin and become a chrysalid.Everything thus tends to make us
ask by what stratagem the egg is shielded from danger.This stratagem I longed to discover; I would not be put off by the
scarcity of nests, by the irksomeness of the searches, by the risk of
sunstroke, by the time taken up, by the vain breaking open of
unsuitable cells; I meant to see and I saw.Here is my method: with the
point of a knife and a pair of nippers, I make a side opening, a
window, beneath the dome of Eumenes Amedei and Eumenes pomiformis.I
work with the greatest care, so as not to injure the recluse.Formerly
I attacked the cupola from the top, now I attack it from the side.I
stop when the breach is large enough to allow me to see the state of
things within.I pause to give the reader time to
reflect and to think out for himself a means of safety that will
protect the egg and afterwards the grub in the perilous conditions
which I have set forth.Seek, think and contrive, such of you as have
inventive minds.The egg is not laid upon the provisions; it is hung from the top of the
cupola by a thread which vies with that of a Spider's web for
slenderness.The dainty cylinder quivers and swings to and fro at the
least breath; it reminds me of the famous pendulum suspended from the
dome of the Pantheon to prove the rotation of the earth.The victuals
are heaped up underneath.In order to witness it, we must
open a window in cell upon cell until fortune deigns to smile upon us.The larva is hatched and already fairly large.Like the egg, it hangs
perpendicularly, by the rear, from the ceiling; but the suspensory cord
has gained considerably in length and consists of the original thread
eked out by a sort of ribbon.The grub is at dinner: head downwards, it
is digging into the limp belly of one of the caterpillars.I touch up
the game that is still intact with a straw.The grub forthwith retires from the fray.Marvel is
added to marvels: what I took for a flat cord, for a ribbon, at the
lower end of the suspensory thread, is a sheath, a scabbard, a sort of
ascending gallery wherein the larva crawls backwards and makes its way
up.The cast shell of the egg, retaining its cylindrical form and
perhaps lengthened by a special operation on the part of the new-born
grub, forms this safety-channel.At the least sign of danger in the
heap of caterpillars, the larva retreats into its sheath and climbs
back to the ceiling, where the swarming rabble cannot reach it.When
peace is restored, it slides down its case and returns to table, with
its head over the viands and its rear upturned and ready to withdraw in
case of need.Strength has come; the larva is brawny enough not
to dread the movements of the caterpillars' bodies.Besides, the
caterpillars, mortified by fasting and weakened by a prolonged torpor,
become more and more incapable of defence.The perils of the tender
babe are succeeded by the security of the lusty stripling; and the
grub, henceforth scorning its sheathed lift, lets itself drop upon the
game that remains.That is what I saw in the nests of both species of the Eumenes and that
is what I showed to friends who were even more surprised than I by
these ingenious tactics.The egg hanging from the ceiling, at a
distance from the provisions, has naught to fear from the caterpillars,
which flounder about below.The new-hatched larva, whose suspensory
cord is lengthened by the sheath of the egg, reaches the game and takes
a first cautious bite at it.If there be danger, it climbs back to the
ceiling by retreating inside the scabbard.This explains the failure of
my earlier attempts.Not knowing of the safety-thread, so slender and
so easily broken, I gathered at one time the egg, at another the young
larva, after my inroads at the top had caused them to fall into the
middle of the live victuals.Neither of them was able to thrive when
brought into direct contact with the dangerous game.If any one of my readers, to whom I appealed just now, has thought out
something better than the Eumenes' invention, I beg that he will let me
know: there is a curious parallel to be drawn between the inspirations
of reason and the inspirations of instinct.February has its sunny days, heralding spring, to which rude winter
will reluctantly yield place.In snug corners, among the rocks, the
great spurge of our district, the characias of the Greeks, the jusclo
of the Provencals, begins to lift its drooping inflorescence and
discreetly opens a few sombre flowers.Here the first midges of the
year will come to slake their thirst.By the time that the tip of the
stalks reaches the perpendicular, the worst of the cold weather will be
over.Another eager one, the almond-tree, risking the loss of its fruit,
hastens to echo these preludes to the festival of the sun, preludes
which are too often treacherous.A few days of soft skies and it
becomes a glorious dome of white flowers, each twinkling with a roseate
eye.The country, which still lacks green, seems dotted everywhere with
white-satin pavilions.'Twould be a callous heart indeed that could
resist the magic of this awakening.The insect nation is represented at these rites by a few of its more
zealous members.There is first of all the Honey-bee, the sworn enemy
of strikes, who profits by the least lull of winter to find out if some
rosemary or other is not beginning to open somewhere near the hive.The
droning of the busy swarms fills the flowery vault, while a snow of
petals falls softly to the foot of the tree.Together with the population of harvesters there mingles another, less
numerous, of mere drinkers, whose nesting-time has not yet begun.This
is the colony of the Osmiae, those exceedingly pretty solitary bees,
with their copper-<DW52> skin and bright-red fleece.Two species have
come hurrying up to take part in the joys of the almond-tree: first,
the Horned Osmia, clad in black velvet on the head and breast, with red
velvet on the abdomen; and, a little later, the Three-horned Osmia,
whose livery must be red and red only.These are the first delegates
despatched by the pollen-gleaners to ascertain the state of the season
and attend the festival of the early blooms.'Tis but a moment since they burst their cocoon, the winter abode: they
have left their retreats in the crevices of the old walls; should the
north wind blow and set the almond-tree shivering, they will hasten to
return to them.Hail to you, O my dear Osmiae, who yearly, from the far
end of the harmas, opposite snow-capped Ventoux (A mountain in the
Provencal Alps, near Carpentras and Serignan 6,271 feet.--Translator's
Note.), bring me the first tidings of the awakening of the insect
world!I am one of your friends; let us talk about you a little.Most of the Osmiae of my region do not themselves prepare the dwelling
destined for the laying.They want ready-made lodgings, such as the old
cells and old galleries of Anthophorae and Chalicodomae.If these
favourite haunts are lacking, then a hiding-place in the wall, a round
hole in some bit of wood, the tube of a reed, the spiral of a dead
Snail under a heap of stones are adopted, according to the tastes of
the several species.The retreat selected is divided into chambers by
partition-walls, after which the entrance to the dwelling receives a
massive seal.That is the sum-total of the building done.For this plasterer's rather than mason's work, the Horned and the
Three-horned Osmia employ soft earth.This material is a sort of dried
mud, which turns to pap on the addition of a drop of water.The two
Osmiae limit themselves to gathering natural soaked earth, mud in
short, which they allow to dry without any special preparation on their
part; and so they need deep and well-sheltered retreats, into which the
rain cannot penetrate, or the work would fall to pieces.Latreille's Osmia uses different materials for her partitions and her
doors.She chews the leaves of some mucilaginous plant, some mallow
perhaps, and then prepares a sort of green putty with which she builds
her partitions and finally closes the entrance to the dwelling.When
she settles in the spacious cells of the Masked Anthophora (Anthophora
personata, Illig.), the entrance to the gallery, which is wide enough
to admit a man's finger, is closed with a voluminous plug of this
vegetable paste.On the earthy banks, hardened by the sun, the home is
then betrayed by the gaudy colour of the lid.It is as though the
authorities had closed the door and affixed to it their great seals of
green wax.So far then as their building-materials are concerned, the Osmiae whom
I have been able to observe are divided into two classes: one building
compartments with mud, the other with a green-tinted vegetable putty.To the latter belongs Latreille's Osmia.The first section includes the
Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia, both so remarkable for the
horny tubercles on their faces.The great reed of the south, Arundo donax, is often used, in the
country, for making rough garden-shelters against the mistral or just
for fences.These reeds, the ends of which are chopped off to make them
all the same length, are planted perpendicularly in the earth.I have
often explored them in the hope of finding Osmia-nests.The partitions
and the closing-plug of the Horned and of the Three-horned Osmia are
made, as we have seen, of a sort of mud which water instantly reduces
to pap.With the upright position of the reeds, the stopper of the
opening would receive the rain and would become diluted; the ceilings
of the storeys would fall in and the family would perish by drowning.Therefore the Osmia, who knew of these drawbacks before I did, refuses
the reeds when they are placed perpendicularly.The same reed is used for a second purpose.We make canisses of it,
that is to say, hurdles, which, in spring, serve for the rearing of
Silkworms and, in autumn, for the drying of figs.At the end of April
and during May, which is the time when the Osmiae work, the canisses
are indoors, in the Silkworm nurseries, where the Bee cannot take
possession of them; in autumn, they are outside, exposing their layers
of figs and peeled peaches to the sun; but by that time the Osmiae have
long disappeared.If, however, during the spring, an old, disused
hurdle is left out of doors, in a horizontal position, the Three-horned
Osmia often takes possession of it and makes use of the two ends, where
the reeds lie truncated and open.There are other quarters that suit the Three-horned Osmia, who is not
particular, it seems to me, and will make shift with any hiding-place,
so long as it have the requisite conditions of diameter, solidity,
sanitation and kindly darkness.The most original dwellings that I know
her to occupy are disused Snail-shells, especially the house of the
Common Snail (Helix aspersa).Let us go to the <DW72> of the hills thick
with olive-trees and inspect the little supporting-walls which are
built of dry stones and face the south.In the crevices of this
insecure masonry we shall reap a harvest of old Snail-shells, plugged
with earth right up to the orifice.The family of the Three-horned
Osmia is settled in the spiral of those shells, which is subdivided
into chambers by mud partitions.The Three-pronged Osmia (O. Tridentata, Duf.alone creates a
home of her own, digging herself a channel with her mandibles in dry
bramble and sometimes in danewort.She wants a dark retreat, hidden from the eye.I would like, nevertheless, to watch her in the privacy of her home and
to witness her work with the same facility as if she were nest-building
in the open air.Perhaps there are some interesting characteristics to
be picked up in the depths of her retreats.It remains to be seen
whether my wish can be realized.When studying the insect's mental capacity, especially its very
retentive memory for places, I was led to ask myself whether it would
not be possible to make a suitably-chosen Bee build in any place that I
wished, even in my study.And I wanted, for an experiment of this sort,
not an individual but a numerous colony.My preference lent towards the
Three-horned Osmia, who is very plentiful in my neighbourhood, where,
together with Latreille's Osmia, she frequents in particular the
monstrous nests of the Chalicodoma of the Sheds.I therefore thought
out a scheme for making the Three-horned Osmia accept my study as her
settlement and build her nest in glass tubes, through which I could
easily watch the progress.To these crystal galleries, which might well
inspire a certain distrust, were to be added more natural retreats:
reeds of every length and thickness and disused Chalicodoma-nests taken
from among the biggest and the smallest.I admit it, while mentioning that perhaps none ever succeeded so well
with me.All I ask is that the birth of my
insects, that is to say, their first seeing the light, their emerging
from the cocoon, should take place on the spot where I propose to make
them settle.Here there must be retreats of no matter what nature, but
of a shape similar to that in which the Osmia delights.The first
impressions of sight, which are the most long-lived of any, shall bring
back my insects to the place of their birth.And not only will the
Osmiae return, through the always open windows, but they will also
nidify on the natal spot, if they find something like the necessary
conditions.And so, all through the winter, I collect Osmia-cocoons picked up in
the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds; I go to Carpentras to glean a
more plentiful supply in the nests of the Anthophora.I spread out my
stock in a large open box on a table which receives a bright diffused
light but not the direct rays of the sun.The table stands between two
windows facing south and overlooking the garden.When the moment of
hatching comes, those two windows will always remain open to give the
swarm entire liberty to go in and out as it pleases.The glass tubes
and reed-stumps are laid here and there, in fine disorder, close to the
heaps of cocoons and all in a horizontal position, for the Osmia will
have nothing to do with upright reeds.Although such a precaution is
not indispensable, I take care to place some cocoons in each cylinder.The hatching of some of the Osmiae will therefore take place under
cover of the galleries destined to be the building-yard later; and the
site will be all the more deeply impressed on their memory.When I have
made these comprehensive arrangements, there is nothing more to be
done; and I wait patiently for the building-season to open.My Osmiae leave their cocoons in the second half of April.Under the
immediate rays of the sun, in well-sheltered nooks, the hatching would
occur a month earlier, as we can see from the mixed population of the
snowy almond-tree.The constant shade in my study has delayed the
awakening, without, however, making any change in the nesting-period,
which synchronizes with the flowering of the thyme.We now have, around
my working-table, my books, my jars and my various appliances, a
buzzing crowd that goes in and out of the windows at every moment.I
enjoin the household henceforth not to touch a thing in the insects'
laboratory, to do no more sweeping, no more dusting.They might disturb
a swarm and make it think that my hospitality was not to be trusted.During four or five weeks I witness the work of a number of Osmiae
which is much too large to allow my watching their individual
operations.I content myself with a few, whom I mark with
different- spots to distinguish them; and I take no notice of
the others, whose finished work will have my attention later.If the sun is bright, they flutter
around the heap of tubes as if to take careful note of the locality;
blows are exchanged and the rival swains indulge in mild skirmishing on
the floor, then shake the dust off their wings.They fly assiduously
from tube to tube, placing their heads in the orifices to see if some
female will at last make up her mind to emerge.She is covered with dust and has the
disordered toilet that is inseparable from the hard work of the
deliverance.A lover has seen her, so has a second, likewise a third.The lady responds to their advances by clashing
her mandibles, which open and shut rapidly, several times in
succession.The suitors forthwith fall back; and they also, no doubt to
keep up their dignity, execute savage mandibular grimaces.Then the
beauty retires into the arbour and her wooers resume their places on
the threshold.A fresh appearance of the female, who repeats the play
with her jaws; a fresh retreat of the males, who do the best they can
to flourish their own pincers.The Osmiae have a strange way of
declaring their passion: with that fearsome gnashing of their
mandibles, the lovers look as though they meant to devour each other.It suggests the thumps affected by our yokels in their moments of
gallantry.The females, who grow more numerous
from day to day, inspect the premises; they buzz outside the glass
galleries and the reed dwellings; they go in, stay for a while, come
out, go in again and then fly away briskly into the garden.They
return, first one, then another.They halt outside, in the sun, or on
the shutters fastened back against the wall; they hover in the
window-recess, come inside, go to the reeds and give a glance at them,
only to set off again and to return soon after.Thus do they learn to
know their home, thus do they fix their birthplace in their memory.The
village of our childhood is always a cherished spot, never to be
effaced from our recollection.The Osmia's life endures for a month;
and she acquires a lasting remembrance of her hamlet in a couple of
days.'Twas there that she was born; 'twas there that she loved; 'tis
there that she will return.Dulces reminiscitur Argos.(Now falling by another's wound, his eyes
  He casts to heaven, on Argos thinks and dies.--"Aeneid" Book 10, Dryden's translation.)The work of construction begins; and
my expectations are fulfilled far beyond my wishes.The Osmiae build
nests in all the retreats which I have placed at their disposal.And
now, O my Osmiae, I leave you a free field!The work begins with a thorough spring-cleaning of the home.Remnants
of cocoons, dirt consisting of spoilt honey, bits of plaster from
broken partitions, remains of dried Mollusc at the bottom of a shell:
these and much other insanitary refuse must first of all disappear.Violently the Osmia tugs at the offending object and tears it out; and
then off she goes in a desperate hurry, to dispose of it far away from
the study.They are all alike, these ardent sweepers: in their
excessive zeal, they fear lest they should block up the speck of dust
which they might drop in front of the new house.The glass tubes, which
I myself have rinsed under the tap, are not exempt from a scrupulous
cleaning.The Osmia dusts them, brushes them thoroughly with her tarsi
and then sweeps them out backwards.It makes no difference: as a conscientious housewife, she gives the
place a touch of the broom nevertheless.Now for the provisions and the partition-walls.Here the order of the
work changes according to the diameter of the cylinder.My glass tubes
vary greatly in dimensions.The largest have an inner width of a dozen
millimetres (Nearly half an inch.--Translator's Note.); the narrowest
measure six or seven.(About a quarter of an inch.--Translator's Note.)In the latter, if the bottom suit her, the Osmia sets to work bringing
pollen and honey.If the bottom do not suit her, if the sorghum-pith
plug with which I have closed the rear-end of the tube be too irregular
and badly-joined, the Bee coats it with a little mortar.When this
small repair is made, the harvesting begins.In the wider tubes, the work proceeds quite differently.At the moment
when the Osmia disgorges her honey and especially at the moment when,
with her hind-tarsi, she rubs the pollen-dust from her ventral brush,
she needs a narrow aperture, just big enough to allow of her passage.I
imagine that in a straitened gallery the rubbing of her whole body
against the sides gives the harvester a support for her brushing-work.In a spacious cylinder this support fails her; and the Osmia starts
with creating one for herself, which she does by narrowing the channel.Whether it be to facilitate the storing of the victuals or for any
other reason, the fact remains that the Osmia housed in a wide tube
begins with the partitioning.Her division is made by a dab of clay placed at right angles to the
axis of the cylinder, at a distance from the bottom determined by the
ordinary length of a cell.The wad is not a complete round; it is more
crescent-shaped, leaving a circular space between it and one side of
the tube.Fresh layers are swiftly added to the dab of clay; and soon
the tube is divided by a partition which has a circular opening at the
side of it, a sort of dog-hole through which the Osmia will proceed to
knead the Bee-bread.When the victualling is finished and the egg laid
upon the heap, the whole is closed and the filled-up partition becomes
the bottom of the next cell.Then the same method is repeated, that is
to say, in front of the just completed ceiling a second partition is
built, again with a side-passage, which is stouter, owing to its
distance from the centre, and better able to withstand the numerous
comings and goings of the housewife than a central orifice, deprived of
the direct support of the wall, could hope to be.When this partition
is ready, the provisioning of the second cell is effected; and so on
until the wide cylinder is completely stocked.The building of this preliminary party-wall, with a narrow, round
dog-hole, for a chamber to which the victuals will not be brought until
later is not restricted to the Three-horned Osmia; it is also
frequently found in the case of the Horned Osmia and of Latreille's
Osmia.Nothing could be prettier than the work of the last-named, who
goes to the plants for her material and fashions a delicate sheet in
which she cuts a graceful arch.The Chinaman partitions his house with
paper screens; Latreille's Osmia divides hers with disks of thin green
cardboard perforated with a serving-hatch which remains until the room
is completely furnished.When we have no glass houses at our disposal,
we can see these little architectural refinements in the reeds of the
hurdles, if we open them at the right season.By splitting the bramble-stumps in the course of July, we perceive also
that the Three-pronged Osmia notwithstanding her narrow gallery,
follows the same practice as Latreille's Osmia, with a difference.She
does not build a party-wall, which the diameter of the cylinder would
not permit; she confines herself to putting up a frail circular pad of
green putty, as though to limit, before any attempt at harvesting, the
space to be occupied by the Bee-bread, whose depth could not be
calculated afterwards if the insect did not first mark out its
confines.If, in order to see the Osmia's nest as a whole, we split a reed
lengthwise, taking care not to disturb its contents; or, better still,
if we select for examination the string of cells built in a glass tube,
we are forthwith struck by one detail, namely, the uneven distances
between the partitions, which are placed almost at right angles to the
axis of the cylinder.It is these distances which fix the size of the
chambers, which, with a similar base, have different heights and
consequently unequal holding-capacities.The bottom partitions, the
oldest, are farther apart; those of the front part, near the orifice,
are closer together.Moreover, the provisions are plentiful in the
loftier cells, whereas they are niggardly and reduced to one-half or
even one-third in the cells of lesser height.Let me say at once that
the large cells are destined for the females and the small ones for the
males.DISTRIBUTION OF THE SEXES.Does the insect which stores up provisions proportionate to the needs
of the egg which it is about to lay know beforehand the sex of that
egg?What we have to do is to
turn this suspicion into a certainty demonstrated by experiment.And
first let us find out how the sexes are arranged.It is not possible to ascertain the chronological order of a laying,
except by going to suitably-chosen species.Fortunately there are a few
species in which we do not find this difficulty: these are the Bees who
keep to one gallery and build their cells in storeys.Among the number
are the different inhabitants of the bramble-stumps, notably the
Three-pronged Osmiae, who form an excellent subject for observation,
partly because they are of imposing size--bigger than any other
bramble-dwellers in my neighbourhood--partly because they are so
plentiful.Let us briefly recall the Osmia's habits.Amid the tangle of a hedge, a
bramble-stalk is selected, still standing, but a mere withered stump.In this the insect digs a more or less deep tunnel, an easy piece of
work owing to the abundance of soft pith.Provisions are heaped up
right at the bottom of the tunnel and an egg is laid on the surface of
the food: that is the first-born of the family.At a height of some
twelve millimetres (About half an inch.--Translator's Note.This gives a second storey, which in its turn
receives provisions and an egg, the second in order of primogeniture.And so it goes on, storey by storey, until the cylinder is full.Then
the thick plug of the same green material of which the partitions are
formed closes the home and keeps out marauders.In this common cradle, the chronological order of births is perfectly
clear.The first-born of the family is at the bottom of the series; the
last-born is at the top, near the closed door.The others follow from
bottom to top in the same order in which they followed in point of
time.The laying is numbered automatically; each cocoon tells us its
respective age by the place which it occupies.A number of eggs bordering on fifteen represents the entire family of
an Osmia, and my observations enable me to state that the distribution
of the sexes is not governed by any rule.All that I can say in general
is that the complete series begins with females and nearly always ends
with males.The incomplete series--those which the insect has laid in
various places--can teach us nothing in this respect, for they are only
fragments starting we know not whence; and it is impossible to tell
whether they should be ascribed to the beginning, to the end, or to an
intermediate period of the laying.To sum up: in the laying of the
Three-pronged Osmia, no order governs the succession of the sexes;
only, the series has a marked tendency to begin with females and to
finish with males.The mother occupies herself at the start with the stronger sex, the
more necessary, the better-gifted, the female sex, to which she devotes
the first flush of her laying and the fullness of her vigour; later,
when she is perhaps already at the end of her strength, she bestows
what remains of her maternal solicitude upon the weaker sex, the
less-gifted, almost negligible male sex.There are, however, other
species where this law becomes absolute, constant and regular.In order to go more deeply into this curious question I installed some
hives of a new kind on the sunniest walls of my enclosure.They
consisted of stumps of the great reed of the south, open at one end,
closed at the other by the natural knot and gathered into a sort of
enormous pan-pipe, such as Polyphemus might have employed.The
invitation was accepted: Osmiae came in fairly large numbers, to
benefit by the queer installation.Three Osmiae especially (O. Tricornis, Latr., O. cornuta, Latr., O.
Latreillii, Spin.)gave me splendid results, with reed-stumps arranged
either against the wall of my garden, as I have just said, or near
their customary abode, the huge nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.One of them, the Three-horned Osmia, did better still: as I have
described, she built her nests in my study, as plentifully as I could
wish.We will consult this last, who has furnished me with documents beyond
my fondest hopes, and begin by asking her of how many eggs her average
laying consists.Of the whole heap of colonized tubes in my study, or
else out of doors, in the hurdle-reeds and the pan-pipe appliances, the
best-filled contains fifteen cells, with a free space above the series,
a space showing that the laying is ended, for, if the mother had any
more eggs available, she would have lodged them in the room which she
leaves unoccupied.This string of fifteen appears to be rare; it was
the only one that I found.My attempts at indoor rearing, pursued
during two years with glass tubes or reeds, taught me that the
Three-horned Osmia is not much addicted to long series.As though to
decrease the difficulties of the coming deliverance, she prefers short
galleries, in which only a part of the laying is stacked.We must then
follow the same mother in her migration from one dwelling to the next
if we would obtain a complete census of her family.A spot of colour,
dropped on the Bee's thorax with a paint-brush while she is absorbed in
closing up the mouth of the tunnel, enables us to recognize the Osmia
in her various homes.In this way, the swarm that resided in my study furnished me, in the
first year, with an average of twelve cells.Next year, the summer
appeared to be more favourable and the average became rather higher,
reaching fifteen.The most numerous laying performed under my eyes, not
in a tube, but in a succession of Snail-shells, reached the figure of
twenty-six.On the other hand, layings of between eight and ten are not
uncommon.Lastly, taking all my records together, the result is that
the family of the Osmia fluctuates roundabout fifteen in number.I have already spoken of the great differences in size apparent in the
cells of one and the same series.The partitions, at first widely
spaced, draw gradually nearer to one another as they come closer to the
aperture, which implies roomy cells at the back and narrow cells in
front.The contents of these compartments are no less uneven between
one portion and another of the string.Without any exception known to
me, the large cells, those with which the series starts, have more
abundant provisions than the straitened cells with which the series
ends.The heap of honey and pollen in the first is twice or even thrice
as large as that in the second.In the last cells, the most recent in
date, the victuals are but a pinch of pollen, so niggardly in amount
that we wonder what will become of the larva with that meagre ration.One would think that the Osmia, when nearing the end of the laying,
attaches no importance to her last-born, to whom she doles out space
and food so sparingly.The first-born receive the benefit of her early
enthusiasm: theirs is the well-spread table, theirs the spacious
apartments.The work has begun to pall by the time that the last eggs
are laid; and the last-comers have to put up with a scurvy portion of
food and a tiny corner.The difference shows itself in another way after the cocoons are spun.The large cells, those at the back, receive the bulky cocoons; the
small ones, those in front, have cocoons only half or a third as big.Before opening them and ascertaining the sex of the Osmia inside, let
us wait for the transformation into the perfect insect, which will take
place towards the end of summer.If impatience get the better of us, we
can open them at the end of July or in August.The insect is then in
the nymphal stage; and it is easy, under this form, to distinguish the
two sexes by the length of the antennae, which are larger in the males,
and by the glassy protuberances on the forehead, the sign of the future
armour of the females.Well, the small cocoons, those in the narrow
front cells, with their scanty store of provisions, all belong to
males; the big cocoons, those in the spacious and well-stocked cells at
the back, all belong to females.The conclusion is definite: the laying of the Three-horned Osmia
consists of two distinct groups, first a group of females and then a
group of males.With my pan-pipe apparatus displayed on the walls of my enclosure and
with old hurdle-reeds left lying flat out of doors, I obtained the
Horned Osmia in fair quantities.I persuaded Latreille's Osmia to build
her nest in reeds, which she did with a zeal which I was far from
expecting.All that I had to do was to lay some reed-stumps
horizontally within her reach, in the immediate neighbourhood of her
usual haunts, namely, the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.Lastly,
I succeeded without difficulty in making her build her nests in the
privacy of my study, with glass tubes for a house.With both these Osmiae, the division of the gallery is the same as with
the Three-horned Osmia.At the back are large cells with plentiful
provisions and widely-spaced partitions; in front, small cells, with
scanty provisions and partitions close together.Also, the larger cells
supplied me with big cocoons and females; the smaller cells gave me
little cocoons and males.The conclusion therefore is exactly the same
in the case of all three Osmiae.These conclusions, as my notes show, apply likewise, in every respect,
to the various species of Mason-bees; and one clear and simple rule
stands out from this collection of facts.Apart from the strange
exception of the Three-pronged Osmia, who mixes the sexes without any
order, the Bees whom I studied and probably a crowd of others produce
first a continuous series of females and then a continuous series of
males, the latter with less provisions and smaller cells.This
distribution of the sexes agrees with what we have long known of the
Hive-bee, who begins her laying with a long sequence of workers, or
sterile females, and ends it with a long sequence of males.The analogy
continues down to the capacity of the cells and the quantities of
provisions.The real females, the Queen-bees, have wax cells
incomparably more spacious than the cells of the males and receive a
much larger amount of food.Everything therefore demonstrates that we
are here in the presence of a general rule.OPTIONAL DETERMINATION OF THE SEXES.Is there nothing beyond a
laying in two series?Are the Osmiae, the Chalicodomae and the rest of
them fatally bound by this distribution of the sexes into two distinct
groups, the male group following upon the female group, without any
mixing of the two?Is the mother absolutely powerless to make a change
in this arrangement, should circumstances require it?The Three-pronged Osmia already shows us that the problem is far from
being solved.In the same bramble-stump, the two sexes occur very
irregularly, as though at random.Why this mixture in the series of
cocoons of a Bee closely related to the Horned Osmia and the
Three-horned Osmia, who stack theirs methodically by separate sexes in
the hollow of a reed?What the Bee of the brambles does cannot her
kinswomen of the reeds do too?Nothing, so far as I know, explains this
fundamental difference in a physiological act of primary importance.The three Bees belong to the same genus; they resemble one another in
general outline, internal structure and habits; and, with this close
similarity, we suddenly find a strange dissimilarity.There is just one thing that might possibly arouse a suspicion of the
cause of this irregularity in the Three-pronged Osmia's laying.If I
open a bramble-stump in the winter to examine the Osmia's nest, I find
it impossible, in the vast majority of cases, to distinguish positively
between a female and a male cocoon: the difference in size is so small.The cells, moreover, have the same capacity: the diameter of the
cylinder is the same throughout and the partitions are almost always
the same distance apart.If I open it in July, the victualling-period,
it is impossible for me to distinguish between the provisions destined
for the males and those destined for the females.The measurement of
the column of honey gives practically the same depth in all the cells.We find an equal quantity of space and food for both sexes.This result makes us foresee what a direct examination of the two sexes
in the adult form tells us.The male does not differ materially from
the female in respect of size.If he is a trifle smaller, it is
scarcely noticeable, whereas, in the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned
Osmia, the male is only half or a third the size of the female, as we
have seen from the respective bulk of their cocoons.In the Mason-bee
of the Walls there is also a difference in size, though less
pronounced.The Three-pronged Osmia has not therefore to trouble about adjusting
the dimensions of the dwelling and the quantity of the food to the sex
of the egg which she is about to lay; the measure is the same from one
end of the series to the other.It does not matter if the sexes
alternate without order: one and all will find what they need, whatever
their position in the row.The two other Osmiae, with their great
disparity in size between the two sexes, have to be careful about the
twofold consideration of board and lodging.The more I thought about this curious question, the more probable it
appeared to me that the irregular series of the Three-pronged Osmia and
the regular series of the other Osmiae and of the Bees in general were
all traceable to a common law.It seemed to me that the arrangement in
a succession first of females and then of males did not account for
everything.And I was right: that
arrangement in series is only a tiny fraction of the reality, which is
remarkable in a very different way.This is what I am going to prove by
experiment.The succession first of females and then of males is not, in fact,
invariable.Thus, the Chalicodoma, whose nests serve for two or three
generations, ALWAYS lays male eggs in the old male cells, which can be
recognized by their lesser capacity, and female eggs in the old female
cells of more spacious dimensions.This presence of both sexes at a time, even when there are but two
cells free, one spacious and the other small, proves in the plainest
fashion that the regular distribution observed in the complete nests of
recent production is here replaced by an irregular distribution,
harmonizing with the number and holding-capacity of the chambers to be
stocked.The Mason-bee has before her, let me suppose, only five vacant
cells: two larger and three smaller.The total space at her disposal
would do for about a third of the laying.Well, in the two large cells,
she puts females; in the three small cells she puts males.As we find the same sort of thing in all the old nests, we must needs
admit that the mother knows the sex of the eggs which she is going to
lay, because that egg is placed in a cell of the proper capacity.We
can go further, and admit that the mother alters the order of
succession of the sexes at her pleasure, because her layings, between
one old nest and another, are broken up into small groups of males and
females according to the exigencies of space in the actual nest which
she happens to be occupying.Here then is the Chalicodoma, when mistress of an old nest of which she
has not the power to alter the arrangement, breaking up her laying into
sections comprising both sexes just as required by the conditions
imposed upon her.She therefore decides the sex of the egg at will,
for, without this prerogative, she could not, in the chambers of the
nest which she owes to chance, deposit unerringly the sex for which
those chambers were originally built; and this happens however small
the number of chambers to be filled.When the mother herself founds the dwelling, when she lays the first
rows of bricks, the females come first and the males at the finish.But, when she is in the presence of an old nest, of which she is quite
unable to alter the general arrangement, how is she to make use of a
few vacant rooms, the large and small alike, if the sex of the egg be
already irrevocably fixed?She can only do so by abandoning the
arrangement in two consecutive rows and accommodating her laying to the
varied exigencies of the home.Either she finds it impossible to make
an economical use of the old nest, a theory refuted by the evidence, or
else she determines at will the sex of the egg which she is about to
lay.The Osmiae themselves will furnish the most conclusive evidence on the
latter point.We have seen that these Bees are not generally miners,
who themselves dig out the foundation of their cells.They make use of
the old structures of others, or else of natural retreats, such as
hollow stems, the spirals of empty shells and various hiding-places in
walls, clay or wood.Their work is confined to repairs to the house,
such as partitions and covers.There are plenty of these retreats; and
the insects would always find first-class ones if it thought of going
any distance to look for them.But the Osmia is a stay-at-home: she
returns to her birthplace and clings to it with a patience extremely
difficult to exhaust.It is here, in this little familiar corner, that
she prefers to settle her progeny.But then the apartments are few in
number and of all shapes and sizes.There are long and short ones,
spacious ones and narrow.Short of expatriating herself, a Spartan
course, she has to use them all, from first to last, for she has no
choice.Guided by these considerations, I embarked on the experiments
which I will now describe.I have said how my study became a populous hive, in which the
Three-horned Osmia built her nests in the various appliances which I
had prepared for her.Among these appliances, tubes, either of glass or
reed, predominated.There were tubes of all lengths and widths.In the
long tubes, entire or almost entire layings, with a series of females
followed by a series of males, were deposited.As I have already
referred to this result, I will not discuss it again.The short tubes
were sufficiently varied in length to lodge one or other portion of the
total laying.Basing my calculations on the respective lengths of the
cocoons of the two sexes, on the thickness of the partitions and the
final lid, I shortened some of these to the exact dimensions required
for two cocoons only, of different sexes.Well, these short tubes, whether of glass or reed, were seized upon as
eagerly as the long tubes.Moreover, they yielded this splendid result:
their contents, only a part of the total laying, always began with
female and ended with male cocoons.This order was invariable; what
varied was the number of cells in the long tubes and the proportion
between the two sorts of cocoons, sometimes males predominating and
sometimes females.When confronted with tubes too small to receive all her family, the
Osmia is in the same plight as the Mason-bee in the presence of an old
nest.She thereupon acts exactly as the Chalicodoma does.She breaks up
her laying, divides it into series as short as the room at her disposal
demands; and each series begins with females and ends with males.This
breaking up, on the one hand, into sections in all of which both sexes
are represented and the division, on the other hand, of the entire
laying into just two groups, one female, the other male, when the
length of the tube permits, surely provide us with ample evidence of
the insect's power to regulate the sex of the egg according to the
exigencies of space.And besides the exigencies of space one might perhaps venture to add
those connected with the earlier development of the males.These burst
their cocoons a couple of weeks or more before the females; they are
the first who hasten to the sweets of the almond-tree.In order to
release themselves and emerge into the glad sunlight without disturbing
the string of cocoons wherein their sisters are still sleeping, they
must occupy the upper end of the row; and this, no doubt, is the reason
that makes the Osmia end each of her broken layings with males.Being
next to the door, these impatient ones will leave the home without
upsetting the shells that are slower in hatching.I had offered at the same time to the Osmiae in my study some old nests
of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs, which are clay spheroids with
cylindrical cavities in them.These cavities are formed, as in the old
nests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, of the cell properly so-called
and of the exit-way which the perfect insect cut through the outer
coating at the time of its deliverance.The diameter is about 7
millimetres (.273 inch.--Translator's Note.); their depth at the centre
of the heap is 23 millimetres (.897 inch.--Translator's Note.)and at
the edge averages 14 millimetres.(.546 inch.--Translator's Note.)The deep central cells receive only the females of the Osmia; sometimes
even the two sexes together, with a partition in the middle, the female
occupying the lower and the male the upper storey.Lastly, the deeper
cavities on the circumference are allotted to females and the shallower
to males.We know that the Three-horned Osmia prefers to haunt the habitations of
the Bees who nidify in populous colonies, such as the Mason-bee of the
Sheds and the Hairy-footed Anthophora, in whose nests I have noted
similar facts.The choice rests with the mother,
who is guided by considerations of space and, according to the
accommodation at her disposal, which is frequently fortuitous and
incapable of modification, places a female in this cell and a male in
that, so that both may have a dwelling of a size suited to their
unequal development.This is the unimpeachable evidence of the numerous
and varied facts which I have set forth.People unfamiliar with insect
anatomy--the public for whom I write--would probably give the following
explanation of this marvellous prerogative of the Bee: the mother has
at her disposal a certain number of eggs, some of which are irrevocably
female and the others irrevocably male: she is able to pick out of
either group the one which she wants at the actual moment; and her
choice is decided by the holding capacity of the cell that has to be
stocked.Everything would then be limited to a judicious selection from
the heap of eggs.Should this idea occur to him, the reader must hasten to reject it.Nothing could be more false, as the most casual reference to anatomy
will show.The female reproductive apparatus of the Hymenoptera
consists generally of six ovarian tubes, something like glove-fingers,
divided into bunches of three and ending in a common canal, the
oviduct, which carries the eggs outside.Each of these glove-fingers is
fairly wide at the base, but tapers sharply towards the tip, which is
closed.It contains, arranged in a row, one after the other, like beads
on a string, a certain number of eggs, five or six for instance, of
which the lower ones are more or less developed, the middle ones
halfway towards maturity, and the upper ones very rudimentary.Every
stage of evolution is here represented, distributed regularly from
bottom to top, from the verge of maturity to the vague outlines of the
embryo.The sheath clasps its string of ovules so closely that any
inversion of the order is impossible.Besides, an inversion would
result in a gross absurdity: the replacing of a riper egg by another in
an earlier stage of development.Therefore, in each ovarian tube, in each glove-finger, the emergence of
the eggs occurs according to the order governing their arrangement in
the common sheath; and any other sequence is absolutely impossible.Moreover, at the nesting-period, the six ovarian sheaths, one by one
and each in its turn, have at their base an egg which in a very short
time swells enormously.Some hours or even a day before the laying,
that egg by itself represents or even exceeds in bulk the whole of the
ovigerous apparatus.This is the egg which is on the point of being
laid.It is about to descend into the oviduct, in its proper order, at
its proper time; and the mother has no power to make another take its
place.It is this egg, necessarily this egg and no other, that will
presently be laid upon the provisions, whether these be a mess of honey
or a live prey; it alone is ripe, it alone lies at the entrance to the
oviduct; none of the others, since they are farther back in the row and
not at the right stage of development, can be substituted at this
crisis.What will it yield, a male or a female?No lodging has been prepared,
no food collected for it; and yet both food and lodging have to be in
keeping with the sex that will proceed from it.And here is a much more
puzzling condition: the sex of that egg, whose advent is predestined,
has to correspond with the space which the mother happens to have found
for a cell.There is therefore no room for hesitation, strange though
the statement may appear: the egg, as it descends from its ovarian
tube, has no determined sex.It is perhaps during the few hours of its
rapid development at the base of its ovarian sheath, it is perhaps on
its passage through the oviduct that it receives, at the mother's
pleasure, the final impress that will produce, to match the cradle
which it has to fill, either a female or a male.Let us admit that,
when the normal conditions remain, a laying would have yielded m
females and n males.Then, if my conclusions are correct, it must be in
the mother's power, when the conditions are different, to take from the
m group and increase the n group to the same extent; it must be
possible for her laying to be represented as m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, etc.females and by n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, etc.males, the sum of m + n
remaining constant, but one of the sexes being partly permuted into the
other.The ultimate conclusion even cannot be disregarded: we must
admit a set of eggs represented by m - m, or zero, females and of n + m
males, one of the sexes being completely replaced by the other.Conversely, it must be possible for the feminine series to be augmented
from the masculine series to the extent of absorbing it entirely.It
was to solve this question and some others connected with it that I
undertook, for the second time, to rear the Three-horned Osmia in my
study.The problem on this occasion is a more delicate one; but I am also
better-equipped.My apparatus consists of two small closed
packing-cases, with the front side of each pierced with forty holes, in
which I can insert my glass tubes and keep them in a horizontal
position.I thus obtain for the Bees the darkness and mystery which
suit their work and for myself the power of withdrawing from my hive,
at any time, any tube that I wish, with the Osmia inside, so as to
carry it to the light and follow, if need be with the aid of the lens,
the operations of the busy worker.My investigations, however frequent
and minute, in no way hinder the peaceable Bee, who remains absorbed in
her maternal duties.I mark a plentiful number of my guests with a variety of dots on the
thorax, which enables me to follow any one Osmia from the beginning to
the end of her laying.The tubes and their respective holes are
numbered; a list, always lying open on my desk, enables me to note from
day to day, sometimes from hour to hour, what happens in each tube and
particularly the actions of the Osmiae whose backs bear distinguishing
marks.As soon as one tube is filled, I replace it by another.Moreover, I have scattered in front of either hive a few handfuls of
empty Snail-shells, specially chosen for the object which I have in
view.Reasons which I will explain later led me to prefer the shells of
Helix caespitum.Each of the shells, as and when stocked, received the
date of the laying and the alphabetical sign corresponding with the
Osmia to whom it belonged.In this way, I spent five or six weeks in
continual observation.To succeed in an enquiry, the first and foremost
condition is patience.This condition I fulfilled; and it was rewarded
with the success which I was justified in expecting.The first, which are cylindrical
and of the same width throughout, will be of use for confirming the
facts observed in the first year of my experiments in indoor rearing.The others, the majority, consist of two cylinders which are of very
different diameters, set end to end.The front cylinder, the one which
projects a little way outside the hive and forms the entrance-hole,
varies in width between 8 and 12 millimetres.(Between.312 and.468
inch.--Translator's Note.)The second, the back one, contained entirely
within my packing-case, is closed at its far end and is 5 to 6
millimetres in diameter.(.195 to.234 inch.--Translator's Note.)Each
of the two parts of the double-galleried tunnel, one narrow and one
wide, measures at most a decimetre in length.(3.9
inches.--Translator's Note.)I thought it advisable to have these short
tubes, as the Osmia is thus compelled to select different lodgings,
each of them being insufficient in itself to accommodate the total
laying.In this way I shall obtain a greater variety in the
distribution of the sexes.Lastly, at the mouth of each tube, which
projects slightly outside the case, there is a little paper tongue,
forming a sort of perch on which the Osmia alights on her arrival and
giving easy access to the house.With these facilities, the swarm
colonized fifty-two double-galleried tubes, thirty-seven cylindrical
tubes, seventy-eight Snail-shells and a few old nests of the Mason-bee
of the Shrubs.From this rich mine of material I will take what I want
to prove my case.Every series, even when incomplete, begins with females and ends with
males.To this rule I have not yet found an exception, at least in
galleries of normal diameter.In each new abode the mother busies
herself first of all with the more important sex.Bearing this point in
mind, would it be possible for me, by manoeuvring, to obtain an
inversion of this order and make the laying begin with males?I think
so, from the results already ascertained and the irresistible
conclusions to be drawn from them.The double-galleried tubes are
installed in order to put my conjectures to the proof.The back gallery, 5 or 6 millimetres wide (.195 to.234
inch.--Translator's Note.), is too narrow to serve as a lodging for
normally developed females.If, therefore, the Osmia, who is very
economical of her space, wishes to occupy them, she will be obliged to
establish males there.And her laying must necessarily begin here,
because this corner is the rear-most part of the tube.The foremost
gallery is wide, with an entrance-door on the front of the hive.Here,
finding the conditions to which she is accustomed, the mother will go
on with her laying in the order which she prefers.Of the fifty-two double-galleried
tubes, about a third did not have their narrow passage colonized.The
Osmia closed its aperture communicating with the large passage; and the
latter alone received the eggs.The
female Osmiae, though nearly always larger than the males, present
marked differences among one another: some are bigger, some are
smaller.I had to adjust the width of the narrow galleries to Bees of
average dimensions.It may happen therefore that a gallery is too small
to admit the large-sized mothers to whom chance allots it.When the
Osmia is unable to enter the tube, obviously she will not colonize it.She then closes the entrance to this space which she cannot use and
does her laying beyond it, in the wide tube.Had I tried to avoid these
useless apparatus by choosing tubes of larger calibre, I should have
encountered another drawback: the medium-sized mothers, finding
themselves almost comfortable, would have decided to lodge females
there.I had to be prepared for it: as each mother selected her house
at will and as I was unable to interfere in her choice, a narrow tube
would be colonized or not, according as the Osmia who owned it was or
was not able to make her way inside.There remain some forty pairs of tubes with both galleries colonized.In these there are two things to take into consideration.The narrow
rear tubes of 5 or 5 1/2 millimetres (.195 to.214 inch.--Translator's
Note.)--and these are the most numerous--contain males and males only,
but in short series, between one and five.The mother is here so much
hampered in her work that they are rarely occupied from end to end; the
Osmia seems in a hurry to leave them and to go and colonize the front
tube, whose ample space will leave her the liberty of movement
necessary for her operations.The other rear tubes, the minority, whose
diameter is about 6 millimetres (.234 inch.--Translator's Note.),
contain sometimes only females and sometimes females at the back and
males towards the opening.One can see that a tube a trifle wider and a
mother slightly smaller would account for this difference in the
results.Nevertheless, as the necessary space for a female is barely
provided in this case, we see that the mother avoids as far as she can
a two-sex arrangement beginning with males and that she adopts it only
in the last extremity.Finally, whatever the contents of the small tube
may be, those of the large one, following upon it, never vary and
consist of females at the back and males in front.Though incomplete, because of circumstances very difficult to control,
the result of the experiment is none the less very remarkable.Twenty-five apparatus contain only males in their narrow gallery, in
numbers varying from a minimum of one to a maximum of five.After these
comes the colony of the large gallery, beginning with females and
ending with males.And the layings in these apparatus do not always
belong to late summer or even to the intermediate period: a few small
tubes contain the earliest eggs of the entire swarm.A couple of
Osmiae, more forward than the others, set to work on the 23rd of April.Both of them started their laying by placing males in the narrow tubes.The meagre supply of provisions was enough in itself to show the sex,
which proved later to be in accordance with my anticipations.We see
then that, by my artifices, the whole swarm starts with the converse of
the normal order.This inversion is continued, at no matter what
period, from the beginning to the end of the operations.The series
which, according to rule, would begin with females now begins with
males.Once the larger gallery is reached, the laying is pursued in the
usual order.We have advanced one step and that no small one: we have seen that the
Osmia, when circumstances require it, is capable of reversing the
sequence of the sexes.Would it be possible, provided that the tube
were long enough, to obtain a complete inversion, in which the entire
series of the males should occupy the narrow gallery at the back and
the entire series of the females the roomy gallery in front?I think
not; and I will tell you why.Long and narrow cylinders are by no means to the Osmia's taste, not
because of their narrowness but because of their length.Observe that
for each load of honey brought the worker is obliged to move backwards
twice.She enters, head first, to begin by disgorging the honey-syrup
from her crop.Unable to turn in a passage which she blocks entirely,
she goes out backwards, crawling rather than walking, a laborious
performance on the polished surface of the glass and a performance
which, with any other surface, would still be very awkward, as the
wings are bound to rub against the wall with their free end and are
liable to get rumpled or bent.She goes out backwards, reaches the
outside, turns round and goes in again, but this time the opposite way,
so as to brush off the load of pollen from her abdomen on to the heap.If the gallery is at all long, this crawling backwards becomes
troublesome after a time; and the Osmia soon abandons a passage that is
too small to allow of free movement.I have said that the narrow tubes
of my apparatus are, for the most part, only very incompletely
colonized.The Bee, after lodging a small number of males in them,
hastens to leave them.In the wide front gallery she can stay where she
is and still be able to turn round easily for her different
manipulations; she will avoid those two long journeys backwards, which
are so exhausting and so bad for her wings.Another reason no doubt prompts her not to make too great a use of the
narrow passage, in which she would establish males, followed by females
in the part where the gallery widens.The males have to leave their
cells a couple of weeks or more before the females.If they occupy the
back of the house they will die prisoners or else they will overturn
everything on their way out.This risk is avoided by the order which
the Osmia adopts.In my tubes, with their unusual arrangement, the mother might well find
the dilemma perplexing: there is the narrowness of the space at her
disposal and there is the emergence later on.In the narrow tubes, the
width is insufficient for the females; on the other hand, if she lodges
males there, they are liable to perish, since they will be prevented
from issuing at the proper moment.This would perhaps explain the
mother's hesitation and her obstinacy in settling females in some of my
apparatus which looked as if they could suit none but males.A suspicion occurs to me, a suspicion aroused by my attentive
examination of the narrow tubes.All, whatever the number of their
inmates, are carefully plugged at the opening, just as separate tubes
would be.It might therefore be the case that the narrow gallery at the
back was looked upon by the Osmia not as the prolongation of the large
front gallery, but as an independent tube.The facility with which the
worker turns as soon as she reaches the wide tube, her liberty of
action, which is now as great as in a doorway communicating with the
outer air, might well be misleading and cause the Osmia to treat the
narrow passage at the back as though the wide passage in front did not
exist.This would account for the placing of the female in the large
tube above the males in the small tube, an arrangement contrary to her
custom.I will not undertake to decide whether the mother really appreciates
the danger of my snares, or whether she makes a mistake in considering
only the space at her disposal and beginning with males, who are liable
to remain imprisoned.At any rate, I perceive a tendency to deviate as
little as possible from the order which safeguards the emergence of
both sexes.This tendency is demonstrated by her repugnance to
colonizing my narrow tubes with long series of males.However, so far
as we are concerned, it does not matter much what passes at such times
in the Osmia's little brain.Enough for us to know that she dislikes
narrow and long tubes, not because they are narrow, but because they
are at the same time long.And, in fact, she does very well with a short tube of the same
diameter.Such are the cells in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs and the empty shells of the Garden Snail.With the short tube
the two disadvantages of the long tube are avoided.She has very little
of that crawling backwards to do when she has a Snail-shell for the
home of her eggs and scarcely any when the home is the cell of the
Mason-bee.Moreover, as the stack of cocoons numbers two or three at
most, the deliverance will be exempt from the difficulties attached to
a long series.To persuade the Osmia to nidify in a single tube long
enough to receive the whole of her laying and at the same time narrow
enough to leave her only just the possibility of admittance appears to
me a project without the slightest chance of success: the Bee would
stubbornly refuse such a dwelling or would content herself with
entrusting only a very small portion of her eggs to it.On the other
hand, with narrow but short cavities, success, without being easy,
seems to me at least quite possible.Guided by these considerations, I
embarked upon the most arduous part of my problem: to obtain the
complete or almost complete permutation of one sex with the other; to
produce a laying consisting only of males by offering the mother a
series of lodgings suited only to males.Let us in the first place consult the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs.I have said that these mortar spheroids, pierced all over with
little cylindrical cavities, are a adopted pretty eagerly by the
Three-horned Osmia, who colonizes them before my eyes with females in
the deep cells and males in the shallow cells.That is how things go
when the old nest remains in its natural state.With a grater, however,
I scrape the outside of another nest so as to reduce the depth of the
cavities to some ten millimetres.(About two-fifths of an
inch.--Translator's Note.)This leaves in each cell just room for one
cocoon, surmounted by the closing stopper.Of the fourteen cavities in
the nests, I leave two intact, measuring fifteen millimetres in depth.(.585 inch.--Translator's Note.)Nothing could be more striking than
the result of this experiment, made in the first year of my home
rearing.The twelve cavities whose depth had been reduced all received
males; the two cavities left untouched received females.A year passes and I repeat the experiment with a nest of fifteen cells;
but this time all the cells are reduced to the minimum depth with the
grater.Well, the fifteen cells, from first to last, are occupied by
males.It must be quite understood that, in each case, all the
offspring belonged to one mother, marked with her distinguishing dot
and kept in sight as long as her laying lasted.He would indeed be
difficult to please who refused to bow before the results of these two
experiments.If, however, he is not yet convinced, here is something to
remove his last doubts.The Three-horned Osmia often settles her family in old shells,
especially those of the Common Snail (Helix aspersa), who is so common
under the stone-heaps and in the crevices of the little unmortared
walls that support our terraces.In this species the spiral is wide
open, so that the Osmia, penetrating as far down as the helical passage
permits, finds, immediately above the point which is too narrow to
pass, the space necessary for the cell of a female.This cell is
succeeded by others, wider still, always for females, arranged in a
line in the same way as in a straight tube.In the last whorl of the
spiral, the diameter would be too great for a single row.Then
longitudinal partitions are added to the transverse partitions, the
whole resulting in cells of unequal dimensions in which males
predominate, mixed with a few females in the lower storeys.The
sequence of the sexes is therefore what it would be in a straight tube
and especially in a tube with a wide bore, where the partitioning is
complicated by subdivisions on the same level.A single Snail-shell
contains room for six or eight cells.A large, rough earthen stopper
finishes the nest at the entrance to the shell.As a dwelling of this sort could show us nothing new, I chose for my
swarm the Garden Snail (Helix caespitum), whose shell, shaped like a
small swollen Ammonite, widens by slow degrees, the diameter of the
usable portion, right up to the mouth, being hardly greater than that
required by a male Osmia-cocoon.Moreover, the widest part, in which a
female might find room, has to receive a thick stopping-plug, below
which there will often be a free space.Under all these conditions, the
house will hardly suit any but males arranged one after the other.The collection of shells placed at the foot of each hive includes
specimens of different sizes.The smallest are 18 millimetres (.7
inch.--Translator's Note.)in diameter and the largest 24 millimetres.(.936 inch.--Translator's Note.)There is room for two cocoons, or
three at most, according to their dimensions.Now these shells were used by my visitors without any hesitation,
perhaps even with more eagerness than the glass tubes, whose slippery
sides might easily be a little annoying to the Bee.Some of them were
occupied on the first few days of the laying; and the Osmia who had
started with a home of this sort would pass next to a second
Snail-shell, in the immediate neighbourhood of the first, to a third, a
fourth and others still, always close together, until her ovaries were
emptied.The whole family of one mother would thus be lodged in
Snail-shells which were duly marked with the date of the laying and a
description of the worker.The faithful adherents of the Snail-shell
were in the minority.The greater number left the tubes to come to the
shells and then went back from the shells to the tubes.All, after
filling the spiral staircase with two or three cells, closed the house
with a thick earthen stopper on a level with the opening.It was a long
and troublesome task, in which the Osmia displayed all her patience as
a mother and all her talents as a plasterer.When the pupae are sufficiently matured, I proceed to examine these
elegant abodes.The contents fill me with joy: they fulfil my
anticipations to the letter.The great, the very great majority of the
cocoons turn out to be males; here and there, in the bigger cells, a
few rare females appear.The smallness of the space has almost done
away with the stronger sex.This result is demonstrated by the
sixty-eight Snail-shells colonized.But, of this total number, I must
use only those series which received an entire laying and were occupied
by the same Osmia from the beginning to the end of the egg-season.Here
are a few examples, taken from among the most conclusive.From the 6th of May, when she started operations, to the 25th of May,
the date at which her laying ceased, one Osmia occupied seven
Snail-shells in succession.Her family consists of fourteen cocoons, a
number very near the average; and, of these fourteen cocoons, twelve
belong to males and only two to females.Another, between the 9th and 27th of May, stocked six Snail-shells with
a family of thirteen, including ten males and three females.A third, between the 2nd and 29th of May colonized eleven Snail-shells,
a prodigious task.She supplied me with a family of twenty-six, the largest which I have
ever obtained from one Osmia.Well, this abnormal progeny consisted of
twenty-five males and one female.There is no need to go on, after this magnificent example, especially
as the other series would all, without exception, give us the same
result.Two facts are immediately obvious: the Osmia is able to reverse
the order of her laying and to start with a more or less long series of
males before producing any females.There is something better still;
and this is the proposition which I was particularly anxious to prove:
the female sex can be permuted with the male sex and can be permuted to
the point of disappearing altogether.We see this especially in the
third case, where the presence of a solitary female in a family of
twenty-six is due to the somewhat larger diameter of the corresponding
Snail-shell.There would still remain the inverse permutation: to obtain only
females and no males, or very few.The first permutation makes the
second seem very probable, although I cannot as yet conceive a means of
realizing it.The only condition which I can regulate is the dimensions
of the home.When the rooms are small, the males abound and the females
tend to disappear.With generous quarters, the converse would not take
place.I should obtain females and afterwards an equal number of males,
confined in small cells which, in case of need, would be bounded by
numerous partitions.The factor of space does not enter into the
question here.What artifice can we then employ to provoke this second
permutation?So far, I can think of nothing that is worth attempting.Leading a retired life, in the solitude of a
village, having quite enough to do with patiently and obscurely
ploughing my humble furrow, I know little about modern scientific
views.In my young days I had a passionate longing for books and found
it difficult to procure them; to-day, when I could almost have them if
I wanted, I am ceasing to wish for them.It is what usually happens as
life goes on.I do not therefore know what may have been done in the
direction whither this study of the sexes has led me.If I am stating
propositions that are really new or at least more comprehensive than
the propositions already known, my words will perhaps sound heretical.No matter: as a simple translator of facts, I do not hesitate to make
my statement, being fully persuaded that time will turn my heresy into
orthodoxy.Bees lay their eggs in series of first females and then males, when the
two sexes are of different sizes and demand an unequal quantity of
nourishment.When the two sexes are alike in size, as in the case of
Latreille's Osmia, the same sequence may occur, but less regularly.This dual arrangement disappears when the place chosen for the nest is
not large enough to contain the entire laying.We then see broken
layings, beginning with females and ending with males.The egg, as it issues from the ovary, has not yet a fixed sex.The
final impress that produces the sex is given at the moment of laying,
or a little before.So as to be able to give each larva the amount of space and food that
suits it according as it is male or female, the mother can choose the
sex of the egg which she is about to lay.To meet the conditions of the
building, which is often the work of another or else a natural retreat
that admits of little or no alteration, she lays either a male egg or a
female egg AS SHE PLEASES.The distribution of the sexes depends upon
herself.Should circumstances require it, the order of the laying can
be reversed and begin with males; lastly, the entire laying can contain
only one sex.The same privilege is possessed by the predatory Hymenoptera, the
Wasps, at least by those in whom the two sexes are of a different size
and consequently require an amount of nourishment that is larger in the
one case than in the other.The mother must know the sex of the egg
which she is going to lay; she must be able to choose the sex of that
egg so that each larva may obtain its proper portion of food.Generally speaking, when the sexes are of different sizes, every insect
that collects food and prepares or selects a dwelling for its offspring
must be able to choose the sex of the egg in order to satisfy without
mistake the conditions imposed upon it.The question remains how this optional assessment of the sexes is
effected.If I should ever learn
anything about this delicate point, I shall owe it to some happy chance
for which I must wait, or rather watch, patiently.Then what explanation shall I give of the wonderful facts which I have
set forth?I do not explain facts, I relate
them.Growing daily more sceptical of the interpretations suggested to
me and more hesitating as to those which I myself may have to suggest,
the more I observe and experiment, the more clearly I see rising out of
the black mists of possibility an enormous note of interrogation.Dear insects, my study of you has sustained me and continues to sustain
me in my heaviest trials; I must take leave of you for to-day.The
ranks are thinning around me and the long hopes have fled.Shall I be
able to speak of you again?(This forms the closing paragraph of Volume
3 of the "Souvenirs entomologiques," of which the author lived to
publish seven more volumes, containing over 2,500 pages and nearly
850,000 words.--Translator's Note.)Few insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm, that
curious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of life,
kindles a beacon at its tail-end.Who does not know it, at least by
name?Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen from
the moon at its full?The Greeks of old called it lampouris, meaning,
the bright-tailed.Science employs the same term: it calls it the
lantern-bearer, Lampyris noctiluca, Lin.In this case the common name
is inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when translated, becomes
both expressive and accurate.In fact, we might easily cavil at the word "worm."The Lampyris is not
a worm at all, not even in general appearance.He has six short legs,
which he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a trot-about.In the
adult state the male is correctly garbed in wing-cases, like the true
Beetle that he is.The female is an ill-favoured thing who knows naught
of the delights of flying: all her life long she retains the larval
shape, which, for the rest, is similar to that of the male, who himself
is imperfect so long as he has not achieved the maturity that comes
with pairing-time.Even in this initial stage the word "worm" is out of
place.We French have the expression "Naked as a worm" to point to the
lack of any defensive covering.Now the Lampyris is clothed, that is to
say, he wears an epidermis of some consistency; moreover, he is rather
richly : his body is dark brown all over, set off with pale
pink on the thorax, especially on the lower surface.Finally, each
segment is decked at the hinder edge with two spots of a fairly bright
red.A costume like this was never worn by a worm.Let us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the
Lampyris feeds upon.That master of the art of gastronomy,
Brillat-Savarin, said: "Show me what you eat and I will tell you what
you are."A similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to
every insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the least to
the greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the
world; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents of
life.Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is an
eater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with rare
villainy.This detail has long been known to entomologists.What is not so well
known, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have read, is
the curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other instance
anywhere.Before he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anaesthetic: he
chloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of our
modern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before operating
on him.The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of a cherry,
such as, for instance, Helix variabilis, Drap., who, in the hot
weather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and other long, dry
stalks by the road-side and there remains motionless, in profound
meditation, throughout the scorching summer days.It is in some such
resting-place as this that I have often been privileged to light upon
the Lampyris banqueting on the prey which he had just paralysed on its
shaky support by his surgical artifices.He frequents the edges of the
irrigating ditches, with their cool soil, their varied vegetation, a
favourite haunt of the Mollusc.Here, he treats the game on the ground;
and, under these conditions, it is easy for me to rear him at home and
to follow the operator's performance down to the smallest detail.I will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight.I place a
little grass in a wide glass jar.In this I instal a few Glow-worms and
a provision of snails of a suitable size, neither too large nor too
small, chiefly Helix variabilis.Above
all, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired events come
unexpectedly and do not last long.The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the prey,
which, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the shell, except
the edge of the mantle, which projects slightly.Then the hunter's
weapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that cannot be plainly
perceived without the aid of a lens.It consists of two mandibles bent
back powerfully into a hook, very sharp and as thin as a hair.The
microscope reveals the presence of a slender groove running throughout
the length.The insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument.It
all happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than
bites.As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of "tweaksies"
to express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something more like a
tickling than a serious pinch.In conversing with
animals, language loses nothing by remaining juvenile.It is the right
way for the simple to understand one another.The Lampyris doles out his tweaks.He distributes them methodically,
without hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as though
he wished to ascertain the effect produced.Their number is not great:
half a dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it of all power
of movement.That other pinches are administered later, at the time of
eating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain,
because the sequel escapes me.The first few, however--there are never
many--are enough to impart inertia and loss of all feeling to the
Mollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might almost say lightning, methods of
the Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils some poison or other by
means of his grooved hooks.Here is the proof of the sudden efficacy of those twitches, so mild in
appearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated on the
edge of the mantle some four or five times.I prick him with a fine
needle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its shell, still
leaves exposed.There is no quiver of the wounded tissues, no reaction
against the brutality of the needle.A corpse itself could not give
fewer signs of life.Here is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me
Snails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the foot
slowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent.A few
disordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the
Mollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the front
part loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become limp and
give way under their own weight, dangling feebly like a broken stick.Not at all, for I can resuscitate the seeming
corpse at will.After two or three days of that singular condition
which is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the patient and,
though this is not really essential to success, I give him a douche
which will represent the shower so dear to the able-bodied Mollusc.In
about a couple of days, my prisoner, but lately injured by the
Glow-worm's treachery, is restored to his normal state.He revives, in
a manner; he recovers movement and sensibility.He is affected by the
stimulus of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts out his
tentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred.The general torpor,
a sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright.What name shall we give to that form of existence which, for a
time, abolishes the power of movement and the sense of pain?I can see
but one that is approximately suitable: anaesthesia.The exploits of a
host of Wasps whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is
motionless though not dead have taught us the skilful art of the
paralysing insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its
venom.We have now a humble little animal that first produces complete
anaesthesia in its patient.Human science did not in reality invent
this art, which is one of the wonders of latter-day surgery.Much
earlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,
others knew it as well.The animal's knowledge had a long start of
ours; the method alone has changed.Our operators proceed by making us
inhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by
injecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in
infinitesimal doses.Might we not one day be able to benefit from this
hint?What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for us,
if we understood the beastie's secrets better!What does the Lampyris want with anaesthetical talent against a
harmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never
begin the quarrel of his own accord?We find in Algeria
a beetle known as Drilus maroccanus, who, though non-luminous,
approaches our Glow-worm in his organization and especially in his
habits.He, too, feeds on Land Molluscs.His prey is a Cyclostome with
a graceful spiral shell, tightly closed with a stony lid which is
attached to the animal by a powerful muscle.The lid is a movable door
which is quickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal into his house
and as easily opened when the hermit goes forth.With this system of
closing, the abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus knows it.Fixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof the
Lampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the
look-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time.At last the
need of air and food obliges the besieged non-combatant to show
himself: at least, the door is set slightly ajar.The
Drilus is on the spot and strikes his blow.The door can no longer be
closed; and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress.Our
first impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with a
quick-acting pair of shears.The Drilus is
not well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy mass so
promptly.The operation has to succeed at once, at the first touch: if
not, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full vigour, and the
siege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever, exposing the insect to
fasts indefinitely prolonged.Although I have never come across the
Drilus, who is a stranger to my district, I conjecture a method of
attack very similar to that of the Glow-worm.Like our own Snail-eater,
the Algerian insect does not cut its victim into small pieces: it
renders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a few tweaks which are
easily distributed, if the lid but half-opens for a second.The besieger thereupon enters and, in perfect quiet, consumes a
prey incapable of the least muscular effort.That is how I see things
by the unaided light of logic.Let us now return to the Glow-worm.When the Snail is on the ground,
creeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents any
difficulty.The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's
fore-part to a great extent exposed.Here, on the edges of the mantle,
contracted by the fear of danger, the Mollusc is vulnerable and
incapable of defence.But it also frequently happens that the Snail
occupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or
perhaps to the smooth surface of a stone.This support serves him as a
temporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might try
to molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express condition
that no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting circumference.If,
on the other hand, in the frequent case when the shell does not fit its
support quite closely, some point, however tiny, be left uncovered,
this is enough for the subtle tools of the Lampyris, who just nibbles
at the Mollusc and at once plunges him into that profound immobility
which favours the tranquil proceedings of the consumer.The assailant has to
handle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which would
make the Snail let go his support and, at the very least, precipitate
him from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully slumbering.Now any
game falling to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss, for the
Glow-worm has no great zeal for hunting-expeditions: he profits by the
discoveries which good luck sends him, without undertaking assiduous
searches.It is essential, therefore, that the equilibrium of a prize
perched on the top of a stalk and only just held in position by a touch
of glue should be disturbed as little as possible during the onslaught;
it is necessary that the assailant should go to work with infinite
circumspection and without producing pain, lest any muscular reaction
should provoke a fall and endanger the prize.As we see, sudden and
profound anaesthesia is an excellent means of enabling the Lampyris to
attain his object, which is to consume his prey in perfect quiet.Does he really eat, that is to say,
does he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute
particles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus?I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives' mouths.The Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word: he drinks
his fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms his prey by
a method recalling that of the maggot.Like the flesh-eating grub of
the Fly, he too is able to digest before consuming; he liquefies his
prey before feeding on it.This is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by the
Glow-worm.The operator is nearly always alone, even when the prize is
a large one, like the common Snail, Helix aspersa.Soon a number of
guests hasten up--two, three, or more--and, without any quarrel with
the real proprietor, all alike fall to.Let us leave them to themselves
for a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the opening
downwards.The contents flow out as easily as would soup from an
overturned saucepan.When the sated diners retire from this gruel, only
insignificant leavings remain.By repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks
which we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the Mollusc is
converted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish
themselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of
some special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it.In
consequence of this method, which first converts the food into a
liquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from the
two fangs which sting the patient and inject the anaesthetic poison and
at the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning the solid
flesh into fluid.Those two tiny implements, which can just be examined
through the lens, must, it seems, have some other object.They are
hollow, and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, who sucks and
drains her capture without having to divide it; but there is this great
difference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants, which are
afterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the sand,
whereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquifier, leaves nothing, or next
to nothing.With similar tools, the one simply sucks the blood of his
prey and the other turns every morsel of his to account, thanks to a
preliminary liquefaction.And this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is
sometimes anything but steady.My rearing-glasses supply me with
magnificent examples.Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in
my apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass
pane, and fix themselves to it with a speck of glair.This is a mere
temporary halt, in which the Mollusc is miserly with his adhesive
product, and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and send it
to the bottom of the jar.Now it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself up there, with
the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak legs.He selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find an
entrance-slit, nibbles at it a little, renders it insensible and,
without delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume for
days on end.When he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;
and yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint
stickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in
the smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit gradually
converted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which the
first attack was delivered.These small details tell us how promptly
the anaesthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how dexterously the
Glow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to fall from a very
slippery, vertical support and without even shaking him on his slight
line of adhesion.Under these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy
legs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is needed
to defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable.And this
apparatus the Lampyris possesses.At the hinder end of the animal we
see a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen short, fleshy
appendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster, sometimes spread into a
rosette.There is your organ of adhesion and locomotion.If he would
fix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth surface, such as a
grass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and spreads it wide on the
support, to which it adheres by its own stickiness.The same organ,
rising and falling, opening and closing, does much to assist the act of
progression.In short, the Glow-worm is a new sort of self-propelled
<DW36>, who decks his hind-quarters with a dainty white rose, a kind
of hand with twelve fingers, not jointed, but moving in every
direction: tubular fingers which do not seize, but stick.The same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and
brush.At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and
repasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder parts, a
performance made possible by the flexibility of his spine.This is done
point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a
scrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes in
the operation.What is his object in thus sponging himself, in dusting
and polishing himself so carefully?It is a question, apparently, of
removing a few atoms of dust or else some traces of viscidity that
remain from the evil contact with the Snail.A wash and brush-up is not
superfluous when one leaves the tub in which the Mollusc has been
treated.If the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming
his prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be
unknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself like
a beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving fame.Let us consider more particularly the female, who, while retaining her
larval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her best during the
hottest part of summer.The lighting-apparatus occupies the last three
segments of the abdomen.On each of the first two it takes the form, on
the ventral surface, of a wide belt covering almost the whole of the
arch; on the third the luminous part is much less and consists simply
of two small crescent-shaped markings, or rather two spots which shine
through to the back and are visible both above and below the animal.Belts and spots emit a glorious white light, delicately tinged with
blue.The general lighting of the Glow-worm thus comprises two groups:
first, the wide belts of the two segments preceding the last; secondly,
the two spots of the final segments.The two belts, the exclusive
attribute of the marriageable female, are the parts richest in light:
to glorify her wedding, the future mother dons her brightest gauds; she
lights her two resplendent scarves.But, before that, from the time of
the hatching, she had only the modest rush-light of the stern.This
efflorescence of light is the equivalent of the final metamorphosis,
which is usually represented by the gift of wings and flight.Its
brilliance heralds the pairing-time.Wings and flight there will be
none: the female retains her humble larval form, but she kindles her
blazing beacon.The male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,
acquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he
possesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end
segment.This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the
entire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season.It appears
upon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged.And we
must not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on
the ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the female
shine only under the abdomen.My hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were; but,
as far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the
luminous organs.I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to separate
pretty nearly half of one of the shining belts.On the skin a sort of white-wash lies spread,
formed of a very fine, granular substance.This is certainly the
light-producing matter.To examine this white layer more closely is
beyond the power of my weary eyes.Just beside it is a curious
air-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches suddenly into a
sort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications.These creep over the
luminous sheet, or even dip into it.The luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs
and the work produced is an oxidation.The white sheet supplies the
oxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush
distributes the flow of air over it.There remains the question of the
substance whereof this sheet is formed.The first suggestion was
phosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word.The Glow-worm was
calcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the simple
substances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has obtained a
satisfactory answer along these lines.Phosphorus seems to play no part
here, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is sometimes
bestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam.The answer lies elsewhere, no one
knows where.We are better-informed as regards another question.Has the Glow-worm a
free control of the light which he emits?Can he turn it on or down or
put it out as he pleases?Has he an opaque screen which is drawn over
the flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed?There is no
need for any such mechanism: the insect has something better for its
revolving light.The thick air-tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the
flow of air and the light is intensified; the same tube, swayed by the
animal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the
light grows fainter or even goes out.It is, in short, the mechanism of
a lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.Excitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion.We must here
distinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the
exclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the
modest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any
age.In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden
and complete, or nearly so.In my nocturnal hunts for young Glow-worms,
measuring about 5 millimetres long (.195 inch.--Translator's Note.), I
can plainly see the glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the
least false step disturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at
once and the coveted insect becomes invisible.Upon the full-grown
females, lit up with their nuptial scarves, even a violent start has
but a slight effect and often none at all.I fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my
menagerie of females in the open air.The illumination continues, as bright and placid as before.I take a
spray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the flock.Not
one of my animals puts out its light; at the very most, there is a
brief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases.I send a puff
of smoke from my pipe into the cage.There are even some extinctions, but these do not last long.Calm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly as ever.I take
some of the captives in my fingers, turn and return them, tease them a
little.The illumination continues and is not much diminished, if I do
not press hard with my thumb.At this period, with the pairing close at
hand, the insect is in all the fervour of its passionate splendour, and
nothing short of very serious reasons would make it put out its signals
altogether.All things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm
himself manages his lighting apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling it
at will; but there is one point at which the voluntary agency of the
insect is without effect.I detach a strip of the epidermis showing one
of the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube, which I close
with a plug of damp wadding, to avoid an over-rapid evaporation.Well,
this scrap of carcass shines away merrily, although not quite as
brilliantly as on the living body.The oxidizable substance, the
luminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding
atmosphere; the flow of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;
and the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as
when it is produced by the contact of the air with the real phosphorus
of the chemists.Let us add that, in aerated water, the luminousness
continues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it is extinguished
in water deprived of its air by boiling.No better proof could be found
of what I have already propounded, namely, that the Glow-worm's light
is the effect of a slow oxidation.The light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark
dropped by the full moon.Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble
illuminant.If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect
darkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, and even
words, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible beyond
a narrow zone.A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's patience.Suppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another.Each
of them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to light up
its neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each individual
specimen.But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in which our
eyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a medium distance.The collective lights confuse the light-bearers into one vague whole.Photography gives us a striking proof of this.I have a score of
females, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage in
the open air.A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their
establishment.When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle
and strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at
every point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous
clusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the
photographer's plates and paper.All that I
obtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense there
according to the numbers forming the group.There is no picture of the
Glow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of thyme.For
want of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is represented by a
blurred splash of white on a black ground.The beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,
invitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the
lower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the summoned
males, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel overhead, in the
air, sometimes a great way up.In its normal position, therefore, the
glittering lure is concealed from the eyes of those concerned; it is
covered by the thick bulk of the bride.The lantern ought really to
gleam on the back and not under the belly; otherwise the light is
hidden under a bushel.The anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every female
has her little wiles of coquetry.At nightfall, every evening, my caged
captives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have thoughtfully
furnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper branches, those
most in sight.Here, instead of keeping quiet, as they did at the foot
of the bush just now, they indulge in violent exercises, twist the tip
of their very flexible abdomen, turn it to one side, turn it to the
other, jerk it in every direction.In this way, the searchlight cannot
fail to gleam, at one moment or another, before the eyes of every male
who goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood, whether on the ground or in the
air.It is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching
Larks.If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird
indifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it
excites it.While the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains, the
male, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited to
catch from afar the least reflection of the calling signal.His
corselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in
the form of a peaked cap or a shade, the object of which appears to be
to limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the luminous
speck to be discerned.Under this arch are the two eyes, which are
relatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a skull-cap and
contiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow groove for the
insertion of the antennae.This double eye, occupying almost the whole
face of the insect and contained in the cavern formed by the spreading
peak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclops' eye.At the moment of the pairing the illumination becomes much fainter, is
almost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble fairy-lamp
of the last segment.This discreet night-light is enough for the
wedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects, lingering
over their respective affairs, murmur the universal marriage-hymn.The round, white eggs are laid, or rather
strewn at random, without the least care on the mother's part, either
on the more or less cool earth or on a blade of grass.These brilliant
ones know nothing at all of family affection.Here is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even
when still contained in the mother's womb.If I happen by accident to
crush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny
streak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel filled
with a phosphorescent fluid.The
luminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of the ovary.Besides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of the eggs is
already made manifest through this clumsy midwifery.A soft opalescent
light shines through the integument of the belly.The young of either sex
have two little rush-lights on the last segment.At the approach of the
severe weather they go down into the ground, but not very far.In my
rearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose earth, they
descend to a depth of three or four inches at most.I dig up a few in
mid-winter.I always find them carrying their faint stern-light.About
the month of April they come up again to the surface, there to continue
and complete their evolution.From start to finish the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of light.The eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise.The full-grown females are
magnificent lighthouses, the adult males retain the glimmer which the
grubs already possessed.We can understand the object of the feminine
beacon; but of what use is all the rest of the pyrotechnic display?To
my great regret, I cannot tell.It is and will be, for many a day to
come, perhaps for all time, the secret of animal physics, which is
deeper than the physics of the books.THE CABBAGE-CATERPILLAR.The cabbage of our modern kitchen-gardens is a semi-artificial plant,
the produce of our agricultural ingenuity quite as much as of the
niggardly gifts of nature.Spontaneous vegetation supplied us with the
long-stalked, scanty-leaved, ill-smelling wilding, as found, according
to the botanists, on the ocean cliffs.He had need of a rare
inspiration who first showed faith in this rustic clown and proposed to
improve it in his garden-patch.Progressing by infinitesimal degrees, culture wrought miracles.It
began by persuading the wild cabbage to discard its wretched leaves,
beaten by the sea-winds, and to replace them by others, ample and
fleshy and close-fitting.It deprived itself of the joys of light by arranging its leaves in a
large compact head, white and tender.In our day, among the successors
of those first tiny hearts, are some that, by virtue of their massive
bulk, have earned the glorious name of chou quintal, as who should say
a hundredweight of cabbage.Later, man thought of obtaining a generous dish with a thousand little
sprays of the inflorescence.Under the cover of
the central leaves, it gorged with food its sheaves of blossom, its
flower-stalks, its branches and worked the lot into a fleshy
conglomeration.Differently entreated, the plant, economizing in the centre of its
shoot, set a whole family of close-wrapped cabbages ladder-wise on a
tall stem.A multitude of dwarf leaf-buds took the place of the
colossal head.Next comes the turn of the stump, an unprofitable, almost wooden,
thing, which seemed never to have any other purpose than to act as a
support for the plant.But the tricks of gardeners are capable of
everything, so much so that the stalk yields to the grower's
suggestions and becomes fleshy and swells into an ellipse similar to
the turnip, of which it possesses all the merits of corpulence, flavour
and delicacy; only the strange product serves as a base for a few
sparse leaves, the last protests of a real stem that refuses to lose
its attributes entirely.If the stem allows itself to be allured, why not the root?It does, in
fact, yield to the blandishments of agriculture: it dilates its pivot
into a flat turnip, which half emerges from the ground.This is the
rutabaga, or swede, the turnip-cabbage of our northern districts.Incomparably docile under our nursing, the cabbage has given its all
for our nourishment and that of our cattle: its leaves, its flowers,
its buds, its stalk, its root; all that it now wants is to combine the
ornamental with the useful, to smarten itself, to adorn our flowerbeds
and cut a good figure on a drawing-room table.It has done this to
perfection, not with its flowers, which, in their modesty, continue
intractable, but with its curly and variegated leaves, which have the
undulating grace of Ostrich-feathers and the rich colouring of a mixed
bouquet.None who beholds it in this magnificence will recognize the
near relation of the vulgar "greens" that form the basis of our
cabbage-soup.The cabbage, first in order of date in our kitchen-gardens, was held in
high esteem by classic antiquity, next after the bean and, later, the
pea; but it goes much farther back, so far indeed that no memories of
its acquisition remain.History pays but little attention to these
details: it celebrates the battle-fields whereon we meet our death, but
scorns to speak of the ploughed fields whereby we thrive; it knows the
names of the kings' bastards, but cannot tell us the origin of wheat.This silence respecting the precious plants that serve as food is most
regrettable.The cabbage in particular, the venerable cabbage, that
denizen of the most ancient garden-plots, would have had extremely
interesting things to teach us.It is a treasure in itself, but a
treasure twice exploited, first by man and next by the caterpillar of
the Pieris, the common Large White Butterfly whom we all know (Pieris
brassicae, Lin.).This caterpillar feeds indiscriminately on the leaves
of all varieties of cabbage, however dissimilar in appearance: he
nibbles with the same appetite red cabbage and broccoli, curly greens
and savoy, swedes and turnip-tops, in short, all that our ingenuity,
lavish of time and patience, has been able to obtain from the original
plant since the most distant ages.But what did the caterpillar eat before our cabbages supplied him with
copious provender?Obviously the Pieris did not wait for the advent of
man and his horticultural works in order to take part in the joys of
life.She lived without us and would have continued to live without us.A Butterfly's existence is not subject to ours, but rightfully
independent of our aid.Before the white-heart, the cauliflower, the savoy and the others were
invented, the Pieris' caterpillar certainly did not lack food: he
browsed on the wild cabbage of the cliffs, the parent of all the
latter-day wealth; but, as this plant is not widely distributed and is,
in any case, limited to certain maritime regions, the welfare of the
Butterfly, whether on plain or hill, demanded a more luxuriant and more
common plant for pasturage.This plant was apparently one of the
Cruciferae, more or less seasoned with sulpheretted essence, like the
cabbages.I rear the Pieris' caterpillars from the egg upwards on the wall-rocket
(Diplotaxis tenuifolia, Dec.), which imbibes strong spices along the
edge of the paths and at the foot of the walls.Penned in a large
wire-gauze bell-cage, they accept this provender without demur; they
nibble it with the same appetite as if it were cabbage; and they end by
producing chrysalids and Butterflies.The change of fare causes not the
least trouble.I am equally successful with other crucifers of a less marked flavour:
white mustard (Sinapis incana, Lin.), dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria,
Lin.), wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum, Lin.), whitlow pepperwort
(Lepidium draba, Lin.), hedge-mustard (Sisymbrium officinale, Scop.).On the other hand, the leaves of the lettuce, the bean, the pea, the
corn-salad are obstinately refused.Let us be content with what we have
seen: the fare has been sufficiently varied to show us that the
cabbage-caterpillar feeds exclusively on a large number of crucifers,
perhaps even on all.As these experiments are made in the enclosure of a bell-cage, one
might imagine that captivity impels the flock to feed, in the absence
of better things, on what it would refuse were it free to hunt for
itself.Having naught else within their reach, the starvelings consume
any and all Cruciferae, without distinction of species.Can things
sometimes be the same in the open fields, where I play none of my
tricks?Can the family of the White Butterfly be settled on other
Crucifers than the cabbage?I start a quest along the paths near the
gardens and end by finding on wild radish and white mustard colonies as
crowded and prosperous as those established on cabbage.Now, except when the metamorphosis is at hand, the caterpillar of the
White Butterfly never travels: he does all his growing on the identical
plant whereon he saw the light.The caterpillars observed on the wild
radish, as well as other households, are not, therefore, emigrants who
have come as a matter of fancy from some cabbage-patch in the
neighbourhood: they have hatched on the very leaves where I find them.Hence I arrive at this conclusion: the White Butterfly, who is fitful
in her flight, chooses cabbage first, to dab her eggs upon, and
different Cruciferae next, varying greatly in appearance.How does the Pieris manage to know her way about her botanical domain?We have seen the Larini (A species of Weevils found on
thistle-heads.--Translator's Note.), those explorers of fleshy
receptacles with an artichoke flavour, astonish us with their knowledge
of the flora of the thistle tribe; but their lore might, at a pinch, be
explained by the method followed at the moment of housing the egg.With
their rostrum, they prepare niches and dig out basins in the receptacle
exploited and consequently they taste the thing a little before
entrusting their eggs to it.On the other hand, the Butterfly, a
nectar-drinker, makes not the least enquiry into the savoury qualities
of the leafage; at most dipping her proboscis into the flowers, she
abstracts a mouthful of syrup.This means of investigation, moreover,
would be of no use to her, for the plant selected for the establishing
of her family is, for the most part, not yet in flower.The mother
flits for a moment around the plant; and that swift examination is
enough: the emission of eggs takes place if the provender be found
suitable.The botanist, to recognize a crucifer, requires the indication provided
by the flower.She does not consult the
seed-vessel, to see if it be long or short, nor yet the petals, four in
number and arranged in a cross, because the plant, as a rule, is not in
flower; and still she recognizes offhand what suits her caterpillars,
in spite of profound differences that would embarrass any but a
botanical expert.Unless the Pieris has an innate power of discrimination to guide her,
it is impossible to understand the great extent of her vegetable realm.She needs for her family Cruciferae, nothing but Cruciferae; and she
knows this group of plants to perfection.I have been an enthusiastic
botanist for half a century and more.Nevertheless, to discover if this
or that plant, new to me, is or is not one of the Cruciferae, in the
absence of flowers and fruits I should have more faith in the
Butterfly's statements than in all the learned records of the books.Where science is apt to make mistakes instinct is infallible.The Pieris has two families a year: one in April and May, the other in
September.The cabbage-patches are renewed in those same months.The
Butterfly's calendar tallies with the gardener's: the moment that
provisions are in sight, consumers are forthcoming for the feast.The eggs are a bright orange-yellow and do not lack prettiness when
examined under the lens.They are blunted cones, ranged side by side on
their round base and adorned with finely-scored longitudinal ridges.They are collected in slabs, sometimes on the upper surface, when the
leaf that serves as a support is spread wide, sometimes on the lower
surface when the leaf is pressed to the next ones.Slabs of a couple of hundred are pretty frequent;
isolated eggs, or eggs collected in small groups, are, on the contrary,
rare.The mother's output is affected by the degree of quietness at the
moment of laying.The outer circumference of the group is irregularly formed, but the
inside presents a certain order.The eggs are here arranged in straight
rows backing against one another in such a way that each egg finds a
double support in the preceding row.This alternation, without being of
an irreproachable precision, gives a fairly stable equilibrium to the
whole.To see the mother at her laying is no easy matter: when examined too
closely, the Pieris decamps at once.The structure of the work,
however, reveals the order of the operations pretty clearly.The
ovipositor swings slowly first in this direction, then in that, by
turns; and a new egg is lodged in each space between two adjoining eggs
in the previous row.The extent of the oscillation determines the
length of the row, which is longer or shorter according to the layer's
fancy.The hatching takes place in about a week.It is almost simultaneous for
the whole mass: as soon as one caterpillar comes out of its egg, the
others come out also, as though the natal impulse were communicated
from one to the other.In the same way, in the nest of the Praying
Mantis, a warning seems to be spread abroad, arousing every one of the
population.It is a wave propagated in all directions from the point
first struck.The egg does not open by means of a dehiscence similar to that of the
vegetable-pods whose seeds have attained maturity; it is the new-born
grub itself that contrives an exit-way by gnawing a hole in its
enclosure.In this manner, it obtains near the top of the cone a
symmetrical dormer-window, clean-edged, with no joins nor unevenness of
any kind, showing that this part of the wall has been nibbled away and
swallowed.But for this breach, which is just wide enough for the
deliverance, the egg remains intact, standing firmly on its base.It is
now that the lens is best able to take in its elegant structure.What
it sees is a bag made of ultra-fine gold-beater's skin, translucent,
stiff and white, retaining the complete form of the original egg.A
score of streaked and knotted lines run from the top to the base.It is
the wizard's pointed cap, the mitre with the grooves carved into
jewelled chaplets.All said, the Cabbage-caterpillar's birth-casket is
an exquisite work of art.The hatching of the lot is finished in a couple of hours and the
swarming family musters on the layer of swaddling-clothes, still in the
same position.For a long time, before descending to the fostering
leaf, it lingers on this kind of hot-bed, is even very busy there.It is browsing a strange kind of grass, the handsome mitres
that remain standing on end.Slowly and methodically, from top to base,
the new-born grubs nibble the wallets whence they have just emerged.By
to-morrow, nothing is left of these but a pattern of round dots, the
bases of the vanished sacks.As his first mouthfuls, therefore, the Cabbage-caterpillar eats the
membranous wrapper of his egg.This is a regulation diet, for I have
never seen one of the little grubs allow itself to be tempted by the
adjacent green stuff before finishing the ritual repast whereat skin
bottles furnish forth the feast.It is the first time that I have seen
a larva make a meal of the sack in which it was born.Of what use can
this singular fare be to the budding caterpillar?I suspect as follows:
the leaves of the cabbage are waxed and slippery surfaces and nearly
always slant considerably.To graze on them without risking a fall,
which would be fatal in earliest childhood, is hardly possible unless
with moorings that afford a steady support.What is needed is bits of
silk stretched along the road as fast as progress is made, something
for the legs to grip, something to provide a good anchorage even when
the grub is upside down.The silk-tubes, where those moorings are
manufactured, must be very scantily supplied in a tiny, new-born
animal; and it is expedient that they be filled without delay with the
aid of a special form of nourishment.Then what shall the nature of the
first food be?Vegetable matter, slow to elaborate and niggardly in its
yield, does not fulfil the desired conditions at all well, for time
presses and we must trust ourselves safely to the slippery leaf.An
animal diet would be preferable: it is easier to digest and undergoes
chemical changes in a shorter time.The wrapper of the egg is of a
horny nature, as silk itself is.It will not take long to transform the
one into the other.The grub therefore tackles the remains of its egg
and turns it into silk to carry with it on its first journeys.If my surmise is well-founded, there is reason to believe that, with a
view to speedily filling the silk-glands to which they look to supply
them with ropes, other caterpillars beginning their existence on smooth
and steeply-slanting leaves also take as their first mouthful the
membranous sack which is all that remains of the egg.The whole of the platform of birth-sacks which was the first
camping-ground of the White Butterfly's family is razed to the ground;
naught remains but the round marks of the individual pieces that
composed it.The structure of piles has disappeared; the prints left by
the piles remain.The little caterpillars are now on the level of the
leaf which shall henceforth feed them.They are a pale orange-yellow,
with a sprinkling of white bristles.The head is a shiny black and
remarkably powerful; it already gives signs of the coming gluttony.The
little animal measures scarcely two millimetres in length.(.078
inch.--Translator's Note.)The troop begins its steadying-work as soon as it comes into contact
with its pasturage, the green cabbage-leaf.Here, there, in its
immediate neighbourhood, each grub emits from its spinning glands short
cables so slender that it takes an attentive lens to catch a glimpse of
them.This is enough to ensure the equilibrium of the almost
imponderable atom.The grub's length promptly increases
from two millimetres to four.Soon, a moult takes place which alters
its costume: its skin becomes speckled, on a pale-yellow ground, with a
number of black dots intermingled with white bristles.Three or four
days of rest are necessary after the fatigue of breaking cover.When
this is over, the hunger-fit starts that will make a ruin of the
cabbage within a few weeks.What a stomach, working continuously day and night!It is a devouring laboratory, through which the foodstuffs merely pass,
transformed at once.I serve up to my caged herd a bunch of leaves
picked from among the biggest: two hours later, nothing remains but the
thick midribs; and even these are attacked when there is any delay in
renewing the victuals.At this rate a "hundredweight-cabbage," doled
out leaf by leaf, would not last my menagerie a week.The gluttonous animal, therefore, when it swarms and multiplies, is a
scourge.How are we to protect our gardens against it?In the days of
Pliny, the great Latin naturalist, a stake was set up in the middle of
the cabbage-bed to be preserved; and on this stake was fixed a Horse's
skull bleached in the sun: a Mare's skull was considered even better.This sort of bogey was supposed to ward off the devouring brood.My confidence in this preservative is but an indifferent one; my reason
for mentioning it is that it reminds me of a custom still observed in
our own days, at least in my part of the country.Nothing is so
long-lived as absurdity.Tradition has retained in a simplified form,
the ancient defensive apparatus of which Pliny speaks.For the Horse's
skull our people have substituted an egg-shell on the top of a switch
stuck among the cabbages.It is easier to arrange; also it is quite as
useful, that is to say, it has no effect whatever.Everything, even the nonsensical, is capable of explanation with a
little credulity.When I question the peasants, our neighbours, they
tell me that the effect of the egg-shell is as simple as can be: the
Butterflies, attracted by the whiteness, come and lay their eggs upon
it.Broiled by the sun and lacking all nourishment on that thankless
support, the little caterpillars die; and that makes so many fewer.I insist; I ask them if they have ever seen slabs of eggs or masses of
young caterpillars on those white shells."Never," they reply, with one voice."It was done in the old days and so we go on doing it: that's all we
know; and that's enough for us."I leave it at that, persuaded that the memory of the Horse's skull,
used once upon a time, is ineradicable, like all the rustic absurdities
implanted by the ages.We have, when all is said, but one means of protection, which is to
watch and inspect the cabbage-leaves assiduously and crush the slabs of
eggs between our finger and thumb and the caterpillars with our feet.Nothing is so effective as this method, which makes great demands on
one's time and vigilance.What pains to obtain an unspoilt cabbage!And
what a debt do we not owe to those humble scrapers of the soil, those
ragged heroes, who provide us with the wherewithal to live!To eat and digest, to accumulate reserves whence the Butterfly will
issue: that is the caterpillar's one and only business.The
Cabbage-caterpillar performs it with insatiable gluttony.Incessantly
it browses, incessantly digests: the supreme felicity of an animal
which is little more than an intestine.There is never a distraction,
unless it be certain see-saw movements which are particularly curious
when several caterpillars are grazing side by side, abreast.Then, at
intervals, all the heads in the row are briskly lifted and as briskly
lowered, time after time, with an automatic precision worthy of a
Prussian drill-ground.Can it be their method of intimidating an always
possible aggressor?Can it be a manifestation of gaiety, when the
wanton sun warms their full paunches?Whether sign of fear or sign of
bliss, this is the only exercise that the gluttons allow themselves
until the proper degree of plumpness is attained.After a month's grazing, the voracious appetite of my caged herd is
assuaged.The caterpillars climb the trelliswork in every direction,
walk about anyhow, with their forepart raised and searching space.Here
and there, as they pass, the swaying herd put forth a thread.They
wander restlessly, anxiously to travel afar.The exodus now prevented
by the trellised enclosure I once saw under excellent conditions.At
the advent of the cold weather, I had placed a few cabbage-stalks,
covered with caterpillars, in a small greenhouse.Those who saw the
common kitchen vegetable sumptuously lodged under glass, in the company
of the pelargonium and the Chinese primrose, were astonished at my
curious fancy.I had my plans: I wanted to find out
how the family of the Large White Butterfly behaves when the cold
weather sets in.At the end of
November, the caterpillars, having grown to the desired extent, left
the cabbages, one by one, and began to roam about the walls.None of
them fixed himself there or made preparations for the transformation.I
suspected that they wanted the choice of a spot in the open air,
exposed to all the rigours of winter.I therefore left the door of the
hothouse open.I found them dispersed all over the neighbouring walls, some thirty
yards off.The thrust of a ledge, the eaves formed by a projecting bit
of mortar served them as a shelter where the chrysalid moult took place
and where the winter was passed.The Cabbage-caterpillar possesses a
robust constitution, unsusceptible to torrid heat or icy cold.All that
he needs for his metamorphosis is an airy lodging, free from permanent
damp.The inmates of my fold, therefore, move about for a few days on the
trelliswork, anxious to travel afar in search of a wall.Finding none
and realizing that time presses, they resign themselves.Each one,
supporting himself on the trellis, first weaves around himself a thin
carpet of white silk, which will form the sustaining layer at the time
of the laborious and delicate work of the nymphosis.He fixes his
rear-end to this base by a silk pad and his fore-part by a strap that
passes under his shoulders and is fixed on either side to the carpet.Thus slung from his three fastenings, he strips himself of his larval
apparel and turns into a chrysalis in the open air, with no protection
save that of the wall, which the caterpillar would certainly have found
had I not interfered.Of a surety, he would be short-sighted indeed that pictured a world of
good things prepared exclusively for our advantage.The earth, the
great foster-mother, has a generous breast.At the very moment when
nourishing matter is created, even though it be with our own zealous
aid, she summons to the feast host upon host of consumers, who are all
the more numerous and enterprising in proportion as the table is more
amply spread.The cherry of our orchards is excellent eating: a maggot
contends with us for its possession.In vain do we weigh suns and
planets: our supremacy, which fathoms the universe, cannot prevent a
wretched worm from levying its toll on the delicious fruit.We make
ourselves at home in a cabbage bed: the sons of the Pieris make
themselves at home there too.Preferring broccoli to wild radish, they
profit where we have profited; and we have no remedy against their
competition save caterpillar-raids and egg-crushing, a thankless,
tedious, and none too efficacious work.The Cabbage-caterpillar eagerly
puts forth his own, so much so that the cultivation of the precious
plant would be endangered if others concerned did not take part in its
defence.These others are the auxiliaries (The author employs this word
to denote the insects that are helpful, while describing as "ravagers"
the insects that are hurtful to the farmer's crops.--Translator's
Note.), our helpers from necessity and not from sympathy.The words
friend and foe, auxiliaries and ravagers are here the mere conventions
of a language not always adapted to render the exact truth.He is our
foe who eats or attacks our crops; our friend is he who feeds upon our
foes.Everything is reduced to a frenzied contest of appetites.In the name of the might that is mine, of trickery, of highway robbery,
clear out of that, you, and make room for me: give me your seat at the
banquet!That is the inexorable law in the world of animals and more or
less, alas, in our own world as well!Now, among our entomological auxiliaries, the smallest in size are the
best at their work.One of them is charged with watching over the
cabbages.She is so small, she works so discreetly that the gardener
does not know her, has not even heard of her.Were he to see her by
accident, flitting around the plant which she protects, he would take
no notice of her, would not suspect the service rendered.I propose to
set forth the tiny <DW40>'s deserts.Scientists call her Microgaster glomeratus.What exactly was in the
mind of the author of the name Microgaster, which means little belly?Did he intend to allude to the insignificance of the abdomen?However slight the belly may be, the insect nevertheless possesses one,
correctly proportioned to the rest of the body, so that the classic
denomination, far from giving us any information, might mislead us,
were we to trust it wholly.Nomenclature, which changes from day to day
and becomes more and more cacophonous, is an unsafe guide.Instead of
asking the animal what its name is, let us begin by asking:

"What can you do?Well, the Microgaster's business is to exploit the Cabbage-caterpillar,
a clearly-defined business, admitting of no possible confusion.In the spring, let us inspect the neighbourhood of
the kitchen-garden.Be our eye never so unobservant, we shall notice
against the walls or on the withered grasses at the foot of the hedges
some very small yellow cocoons, heaped into masses the size of a
hazel-nut.Beside each group lies a Cabbage-caterpillar, sometimes dying,
sometimes dead, and always presenting a most tattered appearance.These
cocoons are the work of the Microgaster's family, hatched or on the
point of hatching into the perfect stage; the caterpillar is the dish
whereon that family has fed during its larval state.The epithet
glomeratus, which accompanies the name of Microgaster, suggests this
conglomeration of cocoons.Let us collect the clusters as they are,
without seeking to separate them, an operation which would demand both
patience and dexterity, for the cocoons are closely united by the
inextricable tangle of their surface-threads.In May a swarm of pigmies
will sally forth, ready to get to business in the cabbages.Colloquial language uses the terms Midge and Gnat to describe the tiny
insects which we often see dancing in a ray of sunlight.There is
something of everything in those aerial ballets.It is possible that
the persecutrix of the Cabbage-caterpillar is there, along with many
another; but the name of Midge cannot properly be applied to her.He
who says Midge says Fly, Dipteron, two-winged insect; and our friend
has four wings, one and all adapted for flying.By virtue of this
characteristic and others no less important, she belongs to the order
of Hymenoptera.(This order includes the Ichneumon-flies, of whom the
Microgaster is one.--Translator's Note.)No matter: as our language
possesses no more precise term outside the scientific vocabulary, let
us use the expression Midge, which pretty well conveys the general
idea.Our Midge, the Microgaster, is the size of an average Gnat.She
measures 3 or 4 millimetres.(.117 to.156 inch.--Translator's Note.)The two sexes are equally numerous and wear the same costume, a black
uniform, all but the legs, which are pale red.In spite of this
likeness, they are easily distinguished.The male has an abdomen which
is slightly flattened and, moreover, curved at the tip; the female,
before the laying, has hers full and perceptibly distended by its
ovular contents.This rapid sketch of the insect should be enough for
our purpose.If we wish to know the grub and especially to inform ourselves of its
manner of living, it is advisable to rear in a cage a numerous herd of
Cabbage-caterpillars.Whereas a direct search on the cabbages in our
garden would give us but a difficult and uncertain harvest, by this
means we shall daily have as many as we wish before our eyes.In the course of June, which is the time when the caterpillars quit
their pastures and go far afield to settle on some wall or other, those
in my fold, finding nothing better, climb to the dome of the cage to
make their preparations and to spin a supporting network for the
chrysalid's needs.Among these spinners we see some weaklings working
listlessly at their carpet.Their appearance makes us deem them in the
grip of a mortal disease.I take a few of them and open their bellies,
using a needle by way of a scalpel.What comes out is a bunch of green
entrails, soaked in a bright yellow fluid, which is really the
creature's blood.These tangled intestines swarm with little lazy
grubs, varying greatly in number, from ten or twenty at least to
sometimes half a hundred.They are the offspring of the Microgaster.The lens makes conscientious enquiries; nowhere
does it manage to show me the vermin attacking solid nourishment, fatty
tissues, muscles or other parts; nowhere do I see them bite, gnaw, or
dissect.The following experiment will tell us more fully: I pour into
a watch-glass the crowds extracted from the hospitable paunches.I
flood them with caterpillar's blood obtained by simple pricks; I place
the preparation under a glass bell-jar, in a moist atmosphere, to
prevent evaporation; I repeat the nourishing bath by means of fresh
bleedings and give them the stimulant which they would have gained from
the living caterpillar.Thanks to these precautions, my charges have
all the appearance of excellent health; they drink and thrive.But this
state of things cannot last long.Soon ripe for the transformation, my
grubs leave the dining-room of the watch-glass as they would have left
the caterpillar's belly; they come to the ground to try and weave their
tiny cocoons.They have missed a
suitable support, that is to say, the silky carpet provided by the
dying caterpillar.No matter: I have seen enough to convince me.The
larvae of the Microgaster do not eat in the strict sense of the word;
they live on soup; and that soup is the caterpillar's blood.Examine the parasites closely and you shall see that their diet is
bound to be a liquid one.They are little white grubs, neatly
segmented, with a pointed forepart splashed with tiny black marks, as
though the atom had been slaking its thirst in a drop of ink.It moves
its hind-quarters slowly, without shifting its position.The mouth is a pore, devoid of any apparatus for
disintegration-work: it has no fangs, no horny nippers, no mandibles;
its attack is just a kiss.It does not chew, it sucks, it takes
discreet sips at the moisture all around it.The fact that it refrains entirely from biting is confirmed by my
autopsy of the stricken caterpillars.In the patient's belly,
notwithstanding the number of nurselings who hardly leave room for the
nurse's entrails, everything is in perfect order; nowhere do we see a
trace of mutilation.Nor does aught on the outside betray any havoc
within.The exploited caterpillars graze and move about peacefully,
giving no sign of pain.It is impossible for me to distinguish them
from the unscathed ones in respect of appetite and untroubled
digestion.When the time approaches to weave the carpet for the support of the
chrysalis, an appearance of emaciation at last points to the evil that
is at their vitals.They are stoics who do not
forget their duty in the hour of death.At last they expire, quite
softly, not of any wounds, but of anaemia, even as a lamp goes out when
the oil comes to an end.The living caterpillar,
capable of feeding himself and forming blood, is a necessity for the
welfare of the grubs; he has to last about a month, until the
Microgaster's offspring have achieved their full growth.The two
calendars synchronize in a remarkable way.When the caterpillar leaves
off eating and makes his preparations for the metamorphosis, the
parasites are ripe for the exodus.The bottle dries up when the
drinkers cease to need it; but until that moment it must remain more or
less well-filled, although becoming limper daily.It is important,
therefore, that the caterpillar's existence be not endangered by wounds
which, even though very tiny, would stop the working of the
blood-fountains.With this intent, the drainers of the bottle are, in a
manner of speaking, muzzled; they have by way of a mouth a pore that
sucks without bruising.The dying caterpillar continues to lay the silk of his carpet with a
slow oscillation of the head.The moment now comes for the parasites to
emerge.This happens in June and generally at nightfall.A breach is
made on the ventral surface or else in the sides, never on the back:
one breach only, contrived at a point of minor resistance, at the
junction of two segments; for it is bound to be a toilsome business, in
the absence of a set of filing-tools.Perhaps the grubs take one
another's places at the point attacked and come by turns to work at it
with a kiss.In one short spell, the whole tribe issues through this single opening
and is soon wriggling about, perched on the surface of the caterpillar.The lens cannot perceive the hole, which closes on the instant.There
is not even a haemorrhage: the bottle has been drained too thoroughly.You must press it between your fingers to squeeze out a few drops of
moisture and thus discover the place of exit.Around the caterpillar, who is not always quite dead and who sometimes
even goes on weaving his carpet a moment longer, the vermin at once
begin to work at their cocoons.The straw- thread, drawn from
the silk-glands by a backward jerk of the head, is first fixed to the
white network of the caterpillar and then produces adjacent warp-beams,
so that, by mutual entanglements, the individual works are welded
together and form an agglomeration in which each of the grubs has its
own cabin.For the moment, what is woven is not the real cocoon, but a
general scaffolding which will facilitate the construction of the
separate shells.All these frames rest upon those adjoining and, mixing
up their threads, become a common edifice wherein each grub contrives a
shelter for itself.Here at last the real cocoon is spun, a pretty
little piece of closely-woven work.In my rearing-jars I obtain as many groups of these tiny shells as my
future experiments can wish for.Three-fourths of the caterpillars have
supplied me with them, so ruthless has been the toll of the spring
births.I lodge these groups, one by one, in separate glass tubes, thus
forming a collection on which I can draw at will, while, in view of my
experiments, I keep under observation the whole swarm produced by one
caterpillar.The adult Microgaster appears a fortnight later, in the middle of June.The riotous multitude is in
the full enjoyment of the pairing-season, for the two sexes always
figure among the guests of any one caterpillar.The carnival of these pigmies bewilders the observer and
makes his head swim.Most of the females, wishful of liberty, plunge down to the waist
between the glass of the tube and the plug of cotton-wool that closes
the end turned to the light; but the lower halves remain free and form
a circular gallery in front of which the males hustle one another, take
one another's places and hastily operate.Each bides his turn, each
attends to his little matters for a few moments and then makes way for
his rivals and goes off to start again elsewhere.The turbulent wedding
lasts all the morning and begins afresh next day, a mighty throng of
couples embracing, separating and embracing once more.There is every reason to believe that, in gardens, the mated ones,
finding themselves in isolated couples, would keep quieter.Here, in
the tube, things degenerate into a riot because the assembly is too
numerous for the narrow space.Apparently a little food, a
few sugary mouthfuls extracted from the flowers.I serve up some
provisions in the tubes: not drops of honey, in which the puny
creatures would get stuck, but little strips of paper spread with that
dainty.They come to them, take their stand on them and refresh
themselves.With this diet,
renewed as the strips dry up, I can keep them in very good condition
until the end of my inquisition.The colonists in my spare
tubes are restless and quick of flight; they will have to be
transferred presently to sundry vessels without my risking the loss of
a good number, or even the whole lot, a loss which my hands, my forceps
and other means of coercion would be unable to prevent by checking the
nimble movements of the tiny prisoners.The irresistible attraction of
the sunlight comes to my aid.If I lay one of my tubes horizontally on
the table, turning one end towards the full light of a sunny window,
the captives at once make for the brighter end and play about there for
a long while, without seeking to retreat.If I turn the tube in the
opposite direction, the crowd immediately shifts its quarters and
collects at the other end.With this bait, I can send it whithersoever I please.We will therefore place the new receptacle, jar or test-tube, on the
table, pointing the closed end towards the window.At its mouth, we
open one of the full tubes.No other precaution is needed: even though
the mouth leaves a large interval free, the swarm hastens into the
lighted chamber.All that remains to be done is to close the apparatus
before moving it.The observer is now in control of the multitude,
without appreciable losses, and is able to question it at will.We will begin by asking:

"How do you manage to lodge your germs inside the caterpillar?"This question and others of the same category, which ought to take
precedence of everything else, are generally neglected by the impaler
of insects, who cares more for the niceties of nomenclature than for
glorious realities.He classifies his subjects, dividing them into
regiments with barbarous labels, a work which seems to him the highest
expression of entomological science.Names, nothing but names: the rest
hardly counts.The persecutor of the Pieris used to be called
Microgaster, that is to say, little belly: to-day she is called
Apanteles, that is to say, the incomplete.Can our friend at least tell us how "the Little Belly" or "the
Incomplete" gets into the caterpillar?A book which,
judging by its recent date, should be the faithful echo of our actual
knowledge, informs us that the Microgaster inserts her eggs direct into
the caterpillar's body.It goes on to say that the parasitic vermin
inhabit the chrysalis, whence they make their way out by perforating
the stout horny wrapper.Hundreds of times have I witnessed the exodus
of the grubs ripe for weaving their cocoons; and the exit has always
been made through the skin of the caterpillar and never through the
armour of the chrysalis.The fact that its mouth is a mere clinging
pore, deprived of any offensive weapon, would even lead me to believe
that the grub is incapable of perforating the chrysalid's covering.This proved error makes me doubt the other proposition, though logical,
after all, and agreeing with the methods followed by a host of
parasites.No matter: my faith in what I read in print is of the
slightest; I prefer to go straight to facts.Before making a statement
of any kind, I want to see, what I call seeing.It is a slower and more
laborious process; but it is certainly much safer.I will not undertake to lie in wait for what takes place on the
cabbages in the garden: that method is too uncertain and besides does
not lend itself to precise observation.As I have in hand the necessary
materials, to wit, my collection of tubes swarming with the parasites
newly hatched into the adult form, I will operate on the little table
in my animals' laboratory.A jar with a capacity of about a litre
(About 1 3/4 pints, or.22 gallon.--Translator's Note.)is placed on
the table, with the bottom turned towards the window in the sun.I put
into it a cabbage-leaf covered with caterpillars, sometimes fully
developed, sometimes half-way, sometimes just out of the egg.A strip
of honeyed paper will serve the Microgaster as a dining room, if the
experiment is destined to take some time.Lastly, by the method of
transfer which I described above, I send the inmates of one of my tubes
into the apparatus.Once the jar is closed, there is nothing left to do
but to let things take their course and to keep an assiduous watch, for
days and weeks, if need be.The caterpillars graze placidly, heedless of their terrible attendants.If some giddy-pates in the turbulent swarm pass over the caterpillars'
spines, these draw up their fore-part with a jerk and as suddenly lower
it again; and that is all: the intruders forthwith decamp.Nor do the
latter seem to contemplate any harm: they refresh themselves on the
honey-smeared strip, they come and go tumultuously.Their short flights
may land them, now in one place, now in another, on the browsing herd,
but they pay no attention to it.What we see is casual meetings, not
deliberate encounters.In vain I change the flock of caterpillars and vary their age; in vain
I change the squad of parasites; in vain I follow events in the jar for
long hours, morning and evening, both in a dim light and in the full
glare of the sun: I succeed in seeing nothing, absolutely nothing, on
the parasite's side, that resembles an attack.No matter what the
ill-informed authors say--ill-informed because they had not the
patience to see for themselves--the conclusion at which I arrive is
positive: to inject the germs, the Microgaster never attacks the
caterpillars.The invasion, therefore, is necessarily effected through the
Butterfly's eggs themselves, as experiment will prove.My broad jar
would tell against the inspection of the troop, kept at too great a
distance by the glass enclosure, and I therefore select a tube an inch
wide.I place in this a shred of cabbage-leaf, bearing a slab of eggs,
as laid by the Butterfly.I next introduce the inmates of one of my
spare vessels.A strip of paper smeared with honey accompanies the new
arrivals.Soon, the females are there, fussing about,
sometimes to the extent of blackening the whole slab of yellow eggs.They inspect the treasure, flutter their wings and brush their
hind-legs against each other, a sign of keen satisfaction.They sound
the heap, probe the interstices with their antennae and tap the
individual eggs with their palpi; then, this one here, that one there,
they quickly apply the tip of their abdomen to the egg selected.Each
time, we see a slender, horny prickle darting from the ventral surface,
close to the end.This is the instrument that deposits the germ under
the film of the egg; it is the inoculation-needle.The operation is
performed calmly and methodically, even when several mothers are
working at one and the same time.Where one has been, a second goes,
followed by a third, a fourth and others yet, nor am I able definitely
to see the end of the visits paid to the same egg.Each time, the
needle enters and inserts a germ.It is impossible, in such a crowd, for the eye to follow the successive
mothers who hasten to lay in each; but there is one quite practicable
method by which we can estimate the number of germs introduced into a
single egg, which is, later, to open the ravaged caterpillars and count
the grubs which they contain.A less repugnant means is to number the
little cocoons heaped up around each dead caterpillar.The total will
tell us how many germs were injected, some by the same mother returning
several times to the egg already treated, others by different mothers.Well, the number of these cocoons varies greatly.Generally, it
fluctuates in the neighbourhood of twenty, but I have come across as
many as sixty-five; and nothing tells me that this is the extreme
limit.What hideous industry for the extermination of a Butterfly's
progeny!I am fortunate at this moment in having a highly-cultured visitor,
versed in the profundities of philosophic thought.I make way for him
before the apparatus wherein the Microgaster is at work.For an hour
and more, standing lens in hand, he, in his turn, looks and sees what I
have just seen; he watches the layers who go from one egg to the other,
make their choice, draw their slender lancet and prick what the stream
of passers-by, one after the other, have already pricked.Thoughtful
and a little uneasy, he puts down his lens at last.Never had he been
vouchsafed so clear a glimpse as here, in my finger-wide tube, of the
masterly brigandage that runs through all life down to that of the very
smallest.Apanteles, see Microgaster glomeratus.Arundo donax, the great reed.Burying-beetles: method of burial.Cabbage Butterfly, her selection of suitable Cruciferae.Calliphora vomitaria, see Bluebottle.Cetonia, or Rose-chafer.Clairville on the Burying-beetle.Cruciferae, the diet of Pieris brassicae.Epeira, Angular, telegraph wire of.nest of E. pomiformis.prey found in nest of E.

appearance similar to the engraving given by M. de Castelnau, which
have been disinterred at Truxillo are deposited in the British museum.They are about six inches in length, and each is provided with five
finger-holes.One of these has all the holes at its upper side, and one
of the holes is considerably smaller than the rest.The specimen which
we engrave (p.64) is ornamented with some simple designs in black.The other has four holes at its upper side and one underneath, the
latter being placed near to the end at which the instrument evidently
was blown.In the aperture of this end some remains of a hardened
paste, or resinous substance, are still preserved.This substance
probably was inserted for the purpose of narrowing the end of the
tube, in order to facilitate the producing of the sounds.The same
contrivance is still resorted to in the construction of the bone-flutes
by some Indian tribes in Guiana.The bones of slain enemies appear
to have been considered especially appropriate for such flutes.The
Araucanians, having killed a prisoner, made flutes of his bones, and
danced and “thundered out their dreadful war-songs, accompanied by the
mournful sounds of these horrid instruments.” Alonso de Ovalle says
of the Indians in Chili: “Their flutes, which they play upon in their
dances, are made of the bones of the Spaniards and other enemies whom
they have overcome in war.This they do by way of triumph and glory for
their victory.They make them likewise of bones of animals; but the
warriors dance only to the flutes made of their enemies.” The Mexicans
and Peruvians obviously possessed a great variety of pipes and flutes,
some of which are still in use among certain Indian tribes.Those which
were found in the famous ruins at Palenque are deposited in the museum
in Mexico.They are:--The _cuyvi_, a pipe on which only five tones
were producible; the _huayllaca_, a sort of flageolet; the _pincullu_,
a flute; and the _chayna_, which is described as “a flute whose
lugubrious and melancholy tones filled the heart with indescribable
sadness, and brought involuntary tears into the eyes.” It was perhaps a
kind of oboe.[Illustration]

The Peruvians had the syrinx, which they called _huayra-puhura_.Some
clue to the proper meaning of this name may perhaps be gathered from
the word _huayra_, which signifies “air.” The _huayra-puhura_ was made
of cane, and also of stone.Sometimes an embroidery of needle-work was
attached to it as an ornament.One specimen which has been disinterred
is adorned with twelve figures precisely resembling Maltese crosses.The cross is a figure which may readily be supposed to suggest itself
very naturally; and it is therefore not so surprising, as it may appear
at a first glance, that the American Indians used it not unfrequently
in designs and sculptures before they came in contact with Christians.[Illustration]

The British museum possesses a _huayra-puhura_ consisting of fourteen
reed pipes of a brownish colour, tied together in two rows by means
of thread, so as to form a double set of seven reeds.Both sets are
almost exactly of the same dimensions and are placed side by side.The
shortest of these reeds measure three inches, and the longest six and
a half.In one set they are open at the bottom, and in the other they
are closed.The reader is probably
aware that the closing of a pipe at the end raises its pitch an octave.Thus, in our organ, the so-called stopped diapason, a set of closed
pipes, requires tubes of only half the length of those which constitute
the open diapason, although both these stops produce tones in the same
pitch; the only difference between them being the quality of sound,
which in the former is less bright than in the latter.The tones yielded by the _huayra-puhura_ in question are as follows:
[Illustration] The highest octave is indistinct, owing to some injury
done to the shortest tubes; but sufficient evidence remains to show
that the intervals were purposely arranged according to the pentatonic
scale.This interesting relic was brought to light from a tomb at Arica.[Illustration]

Another _huayra-puhura_, likewise still yielding sounds, was discovered
placed over a corpse in a Peruvian tomb, and was procured by the French
general, Paroissien.This instrument is made of a greenish stone which
is a species of talc, and contains eight pipes.In the Berlin museum
may be seen a good plaster cast taken from this curious relic.The
height is 5⅜ inches, and its width 6¼ inches.Four of the tubes
have small lateral finger-holes which, when closed, lower the pitch a
semitone.These holes are on the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh
pipe, as shown in the engraving.When the holes are open, the tones
are: [Illustration] and when they are closed: [Illustration] The other
tubes have unalterable tones.The following notation exhibits all the
tones producible on the instrument:

[Illustration]

The musician is likely to speculate what could have induced the
Peruvians to adopt so strange a series of intervals: it seems rather
arbitrary than premeditated.[Illustration]

If (and this seems not to be improbable) the Peruvians considered those
tones which are produced by closing the lateral holes as additional
intervals only, a variety of scales or kinds of _modes_ may have been
contrived by the admission of one or other of these tones among the
essential ones.If we may conjecture from some remarks of Garcilasso
de la Vega, and other historians, the Peruvians appear to have used
different orders of intervals for different kinds of tunes, in a way
similar to what we find to be the case with certain Asiatic nations.We
are told for instance “Each poem, or song, had its appropriate tune,
and they could not put two different songs to one tune; and this was
why the enamoured gallant, making music at night on his flute, with the
tune which belonged to it, told the lady and all the world the joy or
sorrow of his soul, the favour or ill-will which he possessed; so that
it might be said that he spoke by the flute.” Thus also the Hindus have
certain tunes for certain seasons and fixed occasions, and likewise a
number of different modes or scales used for particular kinds of songs.Trumpets are often mentioned by writers who have recorded the manners
and customs of the Indians at the time of the discovery of America.There are, however, scarcely any illustrations to be relied on of these
instruments transmitted to us.The Conch was frequently used as a
trumpet for conveying signals in war.[Illustration]

The engraving represents a kind of trumpet made of wood, and nearly
seven feet in length, which Gumilla found among the Indians in the
vicinity of the Orinoco.It somewhat resembles the _juruparis_, a
mysterious instrument of the Indians on the Rio Haupés, a tributary
of the Rio <DW64>, south America.The _juruparis_ is regarded as an
object of great veneration.So
stringent is this law that any woman obtaining a sight of it is put to
death--usually by poison.No youths are allowed to see it until they
have been subjected to a series of initiatory fastings and scourgings.The _juruparis_ is usually kept hidden in the bed of some stream, deep
in the forest; and no one dares to drink out of that sanctified stream,
or to bathe in its water.At feasts the _juruparis_ is brought out
during the night, and is blown outside the houses of entertainment.The inner portion of the instrument consists of a tube made of slips
of the Paxiaba palm (_Triartea exorrhiza_).When the Indians are about
to use the instrument they nearly close the upper end of the tube
with clay, and also tie above the oblong square hole (shown in the
engraving) a portion of the leaf of the Uaruma, one of the arrow-root
family.Round the tube are wrapped long strips of the tough bark of the
Jébaru (_Parivoa grandiflora_).This covering descends in folds below
the tube.The length of the instrument is from four to five feet.The
illustration, which exhibits the _juruparis_ with its cover and without
it, has been taken from a specimen in the museum at Kew gardens.The
mysteries connected with this trumpet are evidently founded on an old
tradition from prehistoric Indian ancestors._Jurupari_ means “demon”;
and with several Indian tribes on the Amazon customs and ceremonies
still prevail in honour of Jurupari.The Caroados, an Indian tribe in Brazil, have a war trumpet which
closely resembles the _juruparis_.With this people it is the custom
for the chief to give on his war trumpet the signal for battle, and to
continue blowing as long as he wishes the battle to last.The trumpet
is made of wood, and its sound is described by travellers as very deep
but rather pleasant.The sound is easily produced, and its continuance
does not require much exertion; but a peculiar vibration of the lips
is necessary which requires practice.Another trumpet, the _turé_, is
common with many Indian tribes on the Amazon who use it chiefly in war.It is made of a long and thick bamboo, and there is a split reed in the
mouthpiece.It therefore partakes rather of the character of an oboe
or clarinet.The _turé_ is
especially used by the sentinels of predatory hordes, who, mounted on a
lofty tree, give the signal of attack to their comrades.Again, the aborigines in Mexico had a curious contrivance of this kind,
the _acocotl_, now more usually called _clarin_.The former word is
its old Indian name, and the latter appears to have been first given
to the instrument by the Spaniards.The _acocotl_ consists of a very
thin tube from eight to ten feet in length, and generally not quite
straight but with some irregular curves.This tube, which is often not
thicker than a couple of inches in diameter, terminates at one end in
a sort of bell, and has at the other end a small mouthpiece resembling
in shape that of a clarinet.The tube is made of the dry stalk of a
plant which is common in Mexico, and which likewise the Indians call
_acocotl_.The most singular characteristic of the instrument is that
the performer does not blow into it, but inhales the air through it; or
rather, he produces the sound by sucking the mouthpiece.It is said to
require strong lungs to perform on the _acocotl_ effectively according
to Indian notions of taste.[Illustration]

The _botuto_, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the river
Orinoco (of which we engrave two examples), was evidently an ancient
Indian contrivance, but appears to have fallen almost into oblivion
during the last two centuries.It was made of baked clay and was
commonly from three to four feet long: but some trumpets of this kind
were of enormous size.The _botuto_ with two bellies was usually made
thicker than that with three bellies and emitted a deeper sound, which
is described as having been really terrific.These trumpets were used
on occasions of mourning and funeral dances.Alexander von Humboldt saw
the _botuto_ among some Indian tribes near the river Orinoco.Besides those which have been noticed, other antique wind instruments
of the Indians are mentioned by historians; but the descriptions given
of them are too superficial to convey a distinct notion as to their
form and purport.Several of these barbarous contrivances scarcely
deserve to be classed with musical instruments.This may, for instance,
be said of certain musical jars or earthen vessels producing sounds,
which the Peruvians constructed for their amusement.These vessels
were made double; and the sounds imitated the cries of animals or
birds.A similar contrivance of the Indians in Chili, preserved in
the museum at Santiago, is described by the traveller S. S. Hill as
follows:--“It consists of two earthen vessels in the form of our
india-rubber bottles, but somewhat larger, with a flat tube from four
to six inches in length, uniting their necks near the top and slightly
curved upwards, and with a small hole on the upper side one third of
the length of the tube from one side of the necks.To produce the
sounds the bottles were filled with water and suspended to the bough
of a tree, or to a beam, by a string attached to the middle of the
curved tube, and then swung backwards and forwards in such a manner as
to cause each end to be alternately the highest and lowest, so that
the water might pass backwards and forwards from one bottle to the
other through the tube between them.By this means soothing sounds were
produced which, it is said, were employed to lull to repose the drowsy
chiefs who usually slept away the hottest hours of the day.In the
meantime, as the bottles were porous, the water within them diminished
by evaporation, and the sound died gradually away.”

[Illustration]

As regards instruments of percussion, a kind of drum deserves special
notice on account of the ingenuity evinced in its construction.The
Mexicans called it _teponaztli_.They generally made it of a single
block of very hard wood, somewhat oblong square in shape, which they
hollowed, leaving at each end a solid piece about three or four inches
in thickness, and at its upper side a kind of sound-board about a
quarter of an inch in thickness.In this sound-board, if it may be
called so, they made three incisions; namely, two running parallel some
distance lengthwise of the drum, and a third running across from one
of these to the other just in the centre.By this means they obtained
two vibrating tongues of wood which, when beaten with a stick, produced
sounds as clearly defined as are those of our kettle drums.By making
one of the tongues thinner than the other they ensured two different
sounds, the pitch of which they were enabled to regulate by shaving
off more or less of the wood.The bottom of the drum they cut almost
entirely open.The traveller, M. Nebel, was told by archæologists in
Mexico that these instruments always contained the interval of a third,
but on examining several specimens which he saw in museums he found
some in which the two sounds stood towards each other in the relation
of a fourth; while in others they constituted a fifth, in others a
sixth, and in some even an octave.This is noteworthy in so far as it
points to a conformity with our diatonic series of intervals, excepting
the seventh.The _teponaztli_ (engraved above) was generally carved with various
fanciful and ingenious designs.It was beaten with two drumsticks
covered at the end with an elastic gum, called _ule_, which was
obtained from the milky juice extracted from the ule-tree.Some of
these drums were small enough to be carried on a string or strap
suspended round the neck of the player; others, again, measured
upwards of five feet in length, and their sound was so powerful that
it could be heard at a distance of three miles.In some rare instances
a specimen of the _teponaztli_ is still preserved by the Indians in
Mexico, especially among tribes who have been comparatively but little
affected by intercourse with their European aggressors.Herr Heller saw
such an instrument in the hands of the Indians of Huatusco--a village
near Mirador in the Tierra templada, or temperate region, occupying
the <DW72>s of the Cordilleras.Its sound is described as so very loud
as to be distinctly audible at an incredibly great distance.This
circumstance, which has been noticed by several travellers, may perhaps
be owing in some measure to the condition of the atmosphere in Mexico.[Illustration]

Instruments of percussion constructed on a principle more or less
similar to the _teponaztli_ were in use in several other parts of
America, as well as in Mexico.Oviedo gives a drawing of a drum from
San Domingo which, as it shows distinctly both the upper and under
side of the instrument, is here inserted.The largest kind of Mexican _teponaztli_ appears to have been
generally of a cylindrical shape.Clavigero gives a drawing of
such an instrument.Drums, also, constructed of skin or parchment
in combination with wood were not unknown to the Indians.Of this
description was, for instance, the _huehuetl_ of the Aztecs in Mexico,
which consisted, according to Clavigero, of a wooden cylinder somewhat
above three feet in height, curiously carved and painted and covered
at the top with carefully prepared deer-skin.And, what appears the
most remarkable, the parchment (we are told) could be tightened or
slackened by means of cords in nearly the same way as with our own
drum.The _huehuetl_ was not beaten with drumsticks but merely struck
with the fingers, and much dexterity was required to strike it in the
proper manner.Oviedo states that the Indians in Cuba had drums which
were stretched with human skin.And Bernal Diaz relates that when he
was with Cortés in Mexico they ascended together the _Teocalli_ (“House
of God”), a large temple in which human sacrifices were offered by
the aborigines; and there the Spanish visitors saw a large drum which
was made, Diaz tells us, with skins of great serpents.This “hellish
instrument,” as he calls it, produced, when struck, a doleful sound
which was so loud that it could be heard at a distance of two leagues.The name of the Peruvian drum was _huanca_: they had also an instrument
of percussion, called _chhilchiles_, which appears to have been a sort
of tambourine.The rattle was likewise popular with the Indians before the discovery
of America.The Mexicans called it _ajacaxtli_.In construction it was
similar to the rattle at the present day commonly used by the Indians.It was oval or round in shape, and appears to have been usually made
of a gourd into which holes were pierced, and to which a wooden handle
was affixed.A number of little pebbles were enclosed in the hollowed
gourd.The little balls in the
_ajacaxtli_ of pottery, enclosed as they are, may at a first glance
appear a puzzle.Probably, when the rattle was being formed they were
attached to the inside as slightly as possible; and after the clay had
been baked they were detached by means of an implement passed through
the holes.[Illustration]

The Tezcucans (or Acolhuans) belonged to the same race as the Aztecs,
whom they greatly surpassed in knowledge and social refinement.Nezahualcoyotl, a wise monarch of the Tezcucans, abhorred human
sacrifices, and erected a large temple which he dedicated to “The
unknown god, the cause of causes.” This edifice had a tower nine
stories high, on the top of which were placed a number of musical
instruments of various kinds which were used to summon the worshippers
to prayer.Respecting these instruments especial mention is made
of a sonorous metal which was struck with a mallet.This is stated
in a historical essay written by Ixtlilxochitl, a native of Mexico
and of royal descent, who lived in the beginning of the seventeenth
century, and who may be supposed to have been familiar with the musical
practices of his countrymen.But whether the sonorous metal alluded to
was a gong or a bell is not clear from the vague record transmitted to
us.That the bell was known to the Peruvians appears to be no longer
doubtful, since a small copper specimen has been found in one of the
old Peruvian tombs.This interesting relic is now deposited in the
museum at Lima.M. de Castelnau has published a drawing of it, which
is here reproduced.The Peruvians called their bells _chanrares_; it
remains questionable whether this name did not designate rather the
so-called horse bells, which were certainly known to the Mexicans
who called them _yotl_.It is noteworthy that these _yotl_ are found
figured in the picture-writings representing the various objects which
the Aztecs used to pay as tribute to their sovereigns.The collection
of Mexican antiquities in the British museum contains a cluster of
yotl-bells.Being nearly round, they closely resemble the _Schellen_
which the Germans are in the habit of affixing to their horses,
particularly in the winter when they are driving their noiseless
sledges.[Illustration]

Again, in south America sonorous stones are not unknown, and were used
in olden time for musical purposes.The traveller G. T. Vigne saw
among the Indian antiquities preserved in the town of Cuzco, in Peru,
“a musical instrument of green sonorous stone, about a foot long, and
an inch and a half wide, flat-sided, pointed at both ends, and arched
at the back, where it was about a quarter of an inch thick, whence it
diminished to an edge, like the blade of a knife.... In the middle of
the back was a small hole, through which a piece of string was passed;
and when suspended and struck by any hard substance a singularly
musical note was produced.” Humboldt mentions the Amazon-stone, which
on being struck by any hard substance yields a metallic sound.It was
formerly cut by the American Indians into very thin plates, perforated
in the centre and suspended by a string.This kind of stone is not, as might be conjectured from its
name, found exclusively near the Amazon.The name was given to it as
well as to the river by the first European visitors to America, in
allusion to the female warriors respecting whom strange stories are
told.The natives pretending, according to an ancient tradition, that
the stone came from the country of “Women without husbands,” or “Women
living alone.”

As regards the ancient stringed instruments of the American Indians
our information is indeed but scanty.Clavigero says that the Mexicans
were entirely unacquainted with stringed instruments: a statement
the correctness of which is questionable, considering the stage of
civilization to which these people had attained.At any rate, we
generally find one or other kind of such instruments with nations
whose intellectual progress and social condition are decidedly
inferior.The Aztecs had many claims to the character of a civilized
community and (as before said) the Tezcucans were even more advanced
in the cultivation of the arts and sciences than the Aztecs.“The
best histories,” Prescott observes, “the best poems, the best code
of laws, the purest dialect, were all allowed to be Tezcucan.The
Aztecs rivalled their neighbours in splendour of living, and even
in the magnificence of their structures.They displayed a pomp and
ostentatious pageantry, truly Asiatic.” Unfortunately historians
are sometimes not sufficiently discerning in their communications
respecting musical questions.J. Ranking, in describing the grandeur
of the establishment maintained by Montezuma, says that during the
repasts of this monarch “there was music of fiddle, flute, snail-shell,
a kettle-drum, and other strange instruments.” But as this writer does
not indicate the source whence he drew his information respecting
Montezuma’s orchestra including the fiddle, the assertion deserves
scarcely a passing notice.The Peruvians possessed a stringed instrument, called _tinya_, which
was provided with five or seven strings.To conjecture from the
unsatisfactory account of it transmitted to us, the _tinya_ appears to
have been a kind of guitar.Considering the fragility of the materials
of which such instruments are generally constructed, it is perhaps
not surprising that we do not meet with any specimens of them in the
museums of American antiquities.A few remarks will not be out of place here referring to the musical
performances of the ancient Indians; since an acquaintance with the
nature of the performances is likely to afford additional assistance
in appreciating the characteristics of the instruments.In Peru, where
the military system was carefully organised, each division of the army
had its trumpeters, called _cqueppacamayo_, and its drummers, called
_huancarcamayo_.When the Inca returned with his troops victorious from
battle his first act was to repair to the temple of the Sun in order
to offer up thanksgiving; and after the conclusion of this ceremony
the people celebrated the event with festivities, of which music and
dancing constituted a principal part.Musical performances appear to
have been considered indispensable on occasions of public celebrations;
and frequent mention is made of them by historians who have described
the festivals annually observed by the Peruvians.About the month of October the Peruvians celebrated a solemn feast in
honour of the dead, at which ceremony they executed lugubrious songs
and plaintive instrumental music.Compositions of a similar character
were performed on occasion of the decease of a monarch.As soon as it
was made known to the people that their Inca had been “called home to
the mansions of his father the sun” they prepared to celebrate his
obsequies with becoming solemnity.Prescott, in his graphic description
of these observances, says: “At stated intervals, for a year, the
people assembled to renew the expressions of their sorrow; processions
were made displaying the banner of the departed monarch; bards and
minstrels were appointed to chronicle his achievements, and their songs
continued to be rehearsed at high festivals in the presence of the
reigning monarch,--thus stimulating the living by the glorious example
of the dead.” The Peruvians had also particular agricultural songs,
which they were in the habit of singing while engaged in tilling the
lands of the Inca; a duty which devolved upon the whole nation.The
subject of these songs, or rather hymns, referred especially to the
noble deeds and glorious achievements of the Inca and his dynasty.While thus singing, the labourers regulated their work to the rhythm
of the music, thereby ensuring a pleasant excitement and a stimulant in
their occupation, like soldiers regulating their steps to the music of
the military band.These hymns pleased the Spanish invaders so greatly
that they not only adopted several of them but also composed some in a
similar form and style.This appears, however, to have been the case
rather with the poetry than with the music.The name of the Peruvian elegiac songs was _haravi_.Some tunes of
these songs, pronounced to be genuine specimens, have been published
in recent works; but their genuineness is questionable.At all events
they must have been much tampered with, as they exhibit exactly the
form of the Spanish _bolero_.Even allowing that the melodies of
these compositions have been derived from Peruvian _harivaris_, it is
impossible to determine with any degree of certainty how much in them
has been retained of the original tunes, and how much has been supplied
besides the harmony, which is entirely an addition of the European
arranger.The Peruvians had minstrels, called _haravecs_ (_i.e._,
“inventors”), whose occupation it was to compose and to recite the
_haravis_.The Mexicans possessed a class of songs which served as a record
of historical events.Furthermore they had war-songs, love-songs,
and other secular vocal compositions, as well as sacred chants, in
the practice of which boys were instructed by the priests in order
that they might assist in the musical performances of the temple.It appertained to the office of the priests to burn incense, and
to perform music in the temple at stated times of the day.The
commencement of the religious observances which took place regularly
at sunrise, at mid-day, at sunset, and at midnight, was announced by
signals blown on trumpets and pipes.Persons of high position retained
in their service professional musicians whose duty it was to compose
ballads, and to perform vocal music with instrumental accompaniment.The nobles themselves, and occasionally even the monarch, not
unfrequently delighted in composing ballads and odes.Especially to be noticed is the institution termed “Council of music,”
which the wise monarch Nezahualcoyotl founded in Tezcuco.This
institution was not intended exclusively for promoting the cultivation
of music; its aim comprised the advancement of various arts, and of
sciences such as history, astronomy, &c. In fact, it was an academy
for general education.Probably no better evidence could be cited
testifying to the remarkable intellectual attainments of the Mexican
Indians before the discovery of America than this council of music.Although in some respects it appears to have resembled the board of
music of the Chinese, it was planned on a more enlightened and more
comprehensive principle.The Chinese “board of music,” called _Yo
Poo_, is an office connected with the _Lé Poo_ or “board of rites,”
established by the imperial government at Peking.The principal object
of the board of rites is to regulate the ceremonies on occasions
of sacrifices offered to the gods; of festivals and certain court
solemnities; of military reviews; of presentations, congratulations,
marriages, deaths, burials,--in short, concerning almost every possible
event in social and public life.The reader is probably aware that in one of the various hypotheses
which have been advanced respecting the Asiatic origin of the American
Indians China is assigned to them as their ancient home.Some
historians suppose them to be emigrants from Mongolia, Thibet, or
Hindustan; others maintain that they are the offspring of Phœnician
colonists who settled in central America.Even more curious are the
arguments of certain inquirers who have no doubt whatever that the
ancestors of the American Indians were the lost ten tribes of Israel,
of whom since about the time of the Babylonian captivity history is
silent.Whatever may be thought as to which particular one of these
speculations hits the truth, they certainly have all proved useful
in so far as they have made ethnologists more exactly acquainted with
the habits and predilections of the American aborigines than would
otherwise have been the case.For, as the advocates of each hypothesis
have carefully collected and adduced every evidence they were able
to obtain tending to support their views, the result is that (so to
say) no stone has been left unturned.Nevertheless, any such hints as
suggest themselves from an examination of musical instruments have
hitherto remained unheeded.It may therefore perhaps interest the
reader to have his attention drawn to a few suggestive similarities
occurring between instruments of the American Indians and of certain
nations inhabiting the eastern hemisphere.We have seen that the Mexican pipe and the Peruvian syrinx were
purposely constructed so as to produce the intervals of the pentatonic
scale only.There are some additional indications of this scale having
been at one time in use with the American Indians.For instance, the
music of the Peruvian dance _cachua_ is described as having been very
similar to some Scotch national dances; and the most conspicuous
characteristics of the Scotch tunes are occasioned by the frequently
exclusive employment of intervals appertaining to the pentatonic scale.We find precisely the same series of intervals adopted on certain
Chinese instruments, and evidences are not wanting of the pentatonic
scale having been popular among various races in Asia at a remote
period.The series of intervals appertaining to the Chiriqui pipe,
mentioned page 61, consisted of a semitone and two whole tones, like
the _tetrachord_ of the ancient Greeks.In the Peruvian _huayra-puhura_ made of talc some of the pipes possess
lateral holes.This contrivance, which is rather unusual, occurs on the
Chinese _cheng_.The _chayna_, mentioned page 64, seems to have been
provided with a reed, like the oboe: and in Hindustan we find a species
of oboe called _shehna_.The _turé_ of the Indian tribes on the Amazon,
mentioned page 69, reminds us of the trumpets _tooree_, or _tootooree_,
of the Hindus.The name appears to have been known also to the Arabs;
but there is no indication whatever of its having been transmitted to
the peninsula by the Moors, and afterwards to south America by the
Portuguese and Spaniards.The wooden tongues in the drum _teponaztli_ may be considered as a
contrivance exclusively of the ancient American Indians.Nevertheless
a construction nearly akin to it may be observed in certain drums of
the Tonga and Feejee islanders, and of the natives of some islands
in Torres strait.Likewise some <DW64> tribes in western and central
Africa have certain instruments of percussion which are constructed on
a principle somewhat reminding us of the _teponaztli_.The method of
bracing the drum by means of cords, as exhibited in the _huehueil_ of
the Mexican Indians, is evidently of very high antiquity in the east.Rattles, pandean pipes made of reed, and conch trumpets, are found
almost all over the world, wherever the materials of which they are
constructed are easily obtainable.Still, it may be noteworthy that
the Mexicans employed the conch trumpet in their religious observances
apparently in much the same way as it is used in the Buddhist worship
of the Thibetans and Kalmuks.As regards the sonorous metal in the great temple at Tezcuco some
inquirers are sure that it was a gong: but it must be borne in mind
that these inquirers detect everywhere traces proving an invasion of
the Mongols, which they maintain to have happened about six hundred
years ago.Had they been acquainted with the little Peruvian bell
(engraved on page 75) they would have had more tangible musical
evidence in support of their theory than the supposed gong; for this
bell certainly bears a suggestive resemblance to the little hand-bell
which the Buddhists use in their religious ceremonies.The Peruvians interpolated certain songs, especially those which they
were in the habit of singing while cultivating the fields, with the
word _hailli_ which signified “Triumph.” As the subject of these
compositions was principally the glorification of the Inca, the burden
_hailli_ is perhaps all the more likely to remind Europeans of the
Hebrew _hallelujah_.Moreover, Adair, who lived among the Indians of
north America during a period of about forty years, speaks of some
other words which he found used as burdens in hymns sung on solemn
occasions, and which appeared to him to correspond with certain Hebrew
words of a sacred import.As regards the musical accomplishments of the Indian tribes at the
present day they are far below the standard which we have found among
their ancestors.A period of three hundred years of oppression has
evidently had the effect of subduing the melodious expressions of
happiness and contentedness which in former times appear to have
been quite as prevalent with the Indians as they generally are with
independent and flourishing nations.The innate talent for music
evinced by those of the North American Indians who were converted to
Christianity soon after the emigration of the puritans to New England
is very favourably commented on by some old writers.In the year 1661
John Elliot published a translation of the psalms into Indian verse.The singing of these metrical psalms by the Indian converts in their
places of worship appears to have been actually superior to the sacred
vocal performances of their Christian brethren from Europe; for we find
it described by several witnesses as “excellent” and “most ravishing.”

In other parts of America the catholic priests from Spain did not
neglect to turn to account the susceptibility of the Indians for
music.Thus, in central America the Dominicans composed as early as in
the middle of the sixteenth century a sacred poem in the Guatemalian
dialect containing a narrative of the most important events recorded
in the Bible.This production they sang to the natives, and to enhance
the effect they accompanied the singing with musical instruments.The
alluring music soon captivated the heart of a powerful cazique, who
was thus induced to adopt the doctrines embodied in the composition,
and to diffuse them among his subjects who likewise delighted in the
performances.In Peru a similar experiment, resorted to by the priests
who accompanied Pizarro’s expedition, proved equally successful.They
dramatized certain scenes in the life of Christ and represented them
with music, which so greatly fascinated the Indians that many of them
readily embraced the new faith.Nor are these entertainments dispensed
with even at the present day by the Indian Christians, especially
in the village churches of the Sierra in Peru; and as several
religious ceremonies have been retained by these people from their
heathen forefathers, it may be conjectured that their sacred musical
performances also retain much of their ancient heathen character.Most of the musical instruments found among the American Indians at
the present day are evidently genuine old Indian contrivances as they
existed long before the discovery of America.Take, for example, the
peculiarly shaped rattles, drums, flutes, and whistles of the North
American Indians, of which some specimens in the Kensington museum are
described in the large catalogue.A few African instruments, introduced
by the <DW64> slaves, are now occasionally found in the hands of the
Indians, and have been by some travellers erroneously described as
genuine Indian inventions.This is the case with the African _marimba_,
which has become rather popular with the natives of Guatemala in
central America: but such adaptations are very easily discernible.EUROPEAN NATIONS DURING THE MIDDLE AGES.Many representations of musical instruments of the middle ages have
been preserved in manuscripts, as well as in sculptures and paintings
forming ornamental portions of churches and other buildings.Valuable
facts and hints are obtainable from these evidences, provided they
are judiciously selected and carefully examined.The subject is,
however, so large that only a few observations on the most interesting
instruments can be offered here.Unfortunately there still prevails
much uncertainty respecting several of the earliest representations
as to the precise century from which they date, and there is reason
to believe that in some instances the archæological zeal of musical
investigators has assigned a higher antiquity to such discoveries than
can be satisfactorily proved.It appears certain that the most ancient European instruments known to
us were in form and construction more like the Asiatic than was the
case with later ones.Before a nation has attained to a rather high
degree of civilisation its progress in the cultivation of music, as an
art, is very slow indeed.The instruments found at the present day in
Asia are scarcely superior to those which were in use among oriental
nations about three thousand years ago.It is, therefore, perhaps
not surprising that no material improvement is perceptible in the
construction of the instruments of European countries during the lapse
of nearly a thousand years.True, evidences to be relied on referring
to the first five or six centuries of the Christian era are but scanty;
although indications are not wanting which may help the reflecting
musician.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

There are some early monuments of Christian art dating from the fourth
century in which the lyre is represented.In one of them Christ is
depicted as Apollo touching the lyre.This instrument occurs at an
early period in western Europe as used in popular pastimes.In an
Anglo-saxon manuscript of the ninth century in the British museum
(Cleopatra C.are the figures of two gleemen, one playing the
lyre and the other a double-pipe.M. de Coussemaker has published in
the “Annales Archéologiques” the figure of a crowned personage playing
the lyre, which he found in a manuscript of the ninth or tenth century
in the library at Angers.The player twangs the strings with his
fingers, while the Anglo-saxon gleeman before mentioned uses a plectrum._Cithara_ was a name applied to several stringed instruments greatly
varying in form, power of sound, and compass.The illustration
represents a cithara from a manuscript of the ninth century, formerly
in the library of the great monastery of St.When in the year 1768 the monastery was destroyed by fire, this
valuable book perished in the flames; fortunately the celebrated abbot
Gerbert possessed tracings of the illustrations, which were saved from
destruction.He published them, in the year 1774, in his work “De cantu
et musica sacra.” Several illustrations in the following pages, it
will be seen, have been derived from this interesting source.As the
older works on music were generally written in Latin we do not learn
from them the popular names of the instruments; the writers merely
adopted such Latin names as they thought the most appropriate.Thus,
for instance, a very simple stringed instrument of a triangular shape,
and a somewhat similar one of a square shape were designated by the
name of _psalterium_; and we further give a woodcut of the square kind
(p.86), and of a _cithara_ (above) from the same manuscript.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

This last instrument is evidently an improvement upon the triangular
psalterium, because it has a sort of small sound-board at the top.Scarcely better, with regard to acoustics, appears to have been the
instrument designated as _nablum_, which we engrave (p.87) from a
manuscript of the ninth century at Angers.[Illustration]

A small psalterium with strings placed over a sound-board was
apparently the prototype of the _citole_; a kind of dulcimer which was
played with the fingers.The names were not only often vaguely applied
by the mediæval writers but they changed also in almost every century.The psalterium, or psalterion (Italian _salterio_, English _psaltery_),
of the fourteenth century and later had the trapezium shape of the
dulcimer.[Illustration]

The Anglo-saxons frequently accompanied their vocal effusions with a
harp, more or less triangular in shape,--an instrument which may be
considered rather as constituting the transition of the lyre into the
harp.The representation of king David playing the harp is from an
Anglo-saxon manuscript of the beginning of the eleventh century, in
the British museum.The harp was especially popular in central and
northern Europe, and was the favourite instrument of the German and
Celtic bards and of the Scandinavian skalds.In the next illustration
from the manuscript of the monastery of St.Blasius twelve strings
and two sound holes are given to it.A harp similar in form and size,
but without the front pillar, was known to the ancient Egyptians.Perhaps the addition was also non-existent in the earliest specimens
appertaining to European nations; and a sculptured figure of a small
harp constructed like the ancient eastern harp has been discovered in
the old church of Ullard in the county of Kilkenny.Of this curious
relic, which is said to date from a period anterior to the year 800, a
fac-simile taken from Bunting’s “Ancient Music of Ireland” is given (p.As Bunting was the first who drew attention to this sculpture his
account of it may interest the reader.“The drawing” he says “is taken
from one of the ornamental compartments of a sculptured cross, at the
old church of Ullard.From the style of the workmanship, as well as
from the worn condition of the cross, it seems older than the similar
monument at Monasterboice which is known to have been set up before the
year 830.The sculpture is rude; the circular rim which binds the arms
of the cross together is not pierced in the quadrants, and many of the
figures originally in relievo are now wholly abraded.It is difficult
to determine whether the number of strings represented is six or seven;
but, as has been already remarked, accuracy in this respect cannot be
expected either in sculptures or in many picturesque drawings.” The
Finns had a harp (_harpu_, _kantele_) with a similar frame, devoid of
a front pillar, still in use until the commencement of the present
century.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

One of the most interesting stringed instruments of the middle ages
is the _rotta_ (German, _rotte_; English, _rote_).It was sounded by
twanging the strings, and also by the application of the bow.The first
method was, of course, the elder one.There can hardly be a doubt
that when the bow came into use it was applied to certain popular
instruments which previously had been treated like the _cithara_ or
the _psalterium_.The Hindus at the present day use their _suroda_
sometimes as a lute and sometimes as a fiddle.In some measure we
do the same with the violin by playing occasionally _pizzicato_.The
_rotta_ (shown p.Blasius is called in
Gerbert’s work _cithara teutonica_, while the harp is called _cithara
anglica_; from which it would appear that the former was regarded as
pre-eminently a German instrument.Possibly its name may have been
originally _chrotta_ and the continental nations may have adopted it
from the Celtic races of the British isles, dropping the guttural
sound.This hypothesis is, however, one of those which have been
advanced by some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

We engrave also another representation of David playing on the
_rotta_, from a psalter of the seventh century in the British museum
(Cott.According to tradition, this psalter is one of
the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St.The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand of the musician
(see p.22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the time of Joseph.In
the _rotta_ the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized.An
illumination of king David playing the _rotta_ forms the frontispiece
of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved in the cathedral
library of Durham; and which is musically interesting inasmuch as
it represents a _rotta_ of an oblong square shape like that just
noticed and resembling the Welsh _crwth_.It has only five strings
which the performer twangs with his fingers.Again, a very interesting
representation (which we engrave) of the Psalmist with a kind of
_rotta_ occurs in a manuscript of the tenth century, in the British
museum (Vitellius F.The manuscript has been much injured by
a fire in the year 1731, but Professor Westwood has succeeded, with
great care, and with the aid of a magnifying glass, in making out
the lines of the figure.As it has been ascertained that the psalter
is written in the Irish semi-uncial character it is highly probable
that the kind of _rotta_ represents the Irish _cionar cruit_, which
was played by twanging the strings and also by the application of a
bow.Unfortunately we possess no well-authenticated representation
of the Welsh _crwth_ of an early period; otherwise we should in all
probability find it played with the fingers, or with a plectrum.Venantius Fortunatus, an Italian who lived in the second half of the
sixth century, mentions in a poem the “Chrotta Britanna.” He does
not, however, allude to the bow, and there is no reason to suppose
that it existed in England.Howbeit, the Welsh _crwth_ (Anglo-saxon,
_crudh_; English, _crowd_) is only known as a species of fiddle closely
resembling the _rotta_, but having a finger-board in the middle of the
open frame and being strung with only a few strings; while the _rotta_
had sometimes above twenty strings.As it may interest the reader to
examine the form of the modern _crwth_ we give a woodcut of it.Edward
Jones, in his “Musical and poetical relicks of the Welsh bards,”
records that the Welsh had before this kind of _crwth_ a three-stringed
one called “Crwth Trithant,” which was, he says, “a sort of violin, or
more properly a rebeck.” The three-stringed _crwth_ was chiefly used by
the inferior class of bards; and was probably the Moorish fiddle which
is still the favourite instrument of the itinerant bards of the Bretons
in France, who call it _rébek_.The Bretons, it will be remembered, are
close kinsmen of the Welsh.[Illustration]

A player on the _crwth_ or _crowd_ (a crowder) from a bas-relief on the
under part of the seats of the choir in Worcester cathedral (engraved
p.95) dates from the twelfth or thirteenth century; and we give (p.96) a copy of an illumination from a manuscript in the Bibliothèque
royale at Paris of the eleventh century.The player wears a crown on
his head; and in the original some musicians placed at his side are
performing on the psalterium and other instruments.These last are
figured with uncovered heads; whence M. de Coussemaker concludes that
the _crout_ was considered by the artist who drew the figures as the
noblest instrument.It was probably identical with the _rotta_ of the
same century on the continent.[Illustration]

An interesting drawing of an Anglo-saxon fiddle--or _fithele_, as it
was called--is given in a manuscript of the eleventh century in the
British museum (Cotton, Tiberius, c.The instrument is of a pear
shape, with four strings, and the bridge is not indicated.A German
fiddle of the ninth century, called _lyra_, copied by Gerbert from the
manuscript of St.These are shown in the
woodcuts (p.Other records of the employment of the fiddle-bow
in Germany in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are not wanting.For instance, in the famous ‘Nibelungenlied’ Volker is described as
wielding the fiddle-bow not less dexterously than the sword.And in
‘Chronicon picturatum Brunswicense’ of the year 1203, the following
miraculous sign is recorded as having occurred in the village of
Ossemer: “On Wednesday in Whitsun-week, while the parson was fiddling
to his peasants who were dancing, there came a flash of lightning
and struck the parson’s arm which held the fiddle-bow, and killed

Among the oldest representations of performers on instruments of the
violin kind found in England those deserve to be noticed which are
painted on the interior of the roof of Peterborough cathedral.They
are said to date from the twelfth century.One of these figures is
particularly interesting on account of the surprising resemblance which
his instrument bears to our present violin.Not only the incurvations
on the sides of the body but also the two sound-holes are nearly
identical in shape with those made at the present day.Respecting the
reliance to be placed on such evidence, it is necessary to state that
the roof, originally constructed between the years 1177 and 1194, was
thoroughly repaired in the year 1835.Although we find it asserted that
“the greatest care was taken to retain every part, or to restore it
to its original state, so that the figures, even where retouched, are
in effect the same as when first painted,” it nevertheless remains a
debatable question whether the restorers have not admitted some slight
alterations, and have thereby somewhat modernised the appearance of
the instruments.A slight touch with the brush at the sound-holes, the
screws, or the curvatures, would suffice to produce modifications which
might to the artist appear as being only a renovation of the original
representation, but which to the musical investigator greatly impair
the value of the evidence.Sculptures are, therefore, more to be
relied upon in evidence than frescoes.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.The construction of the _organistrum_ requires but little explanation.A glance at the finger-board reveals at once that the different
tones were obtained by raising the keys placed on the neck under the
strings, and that the keys were raised by means of the handles at
the side of the neck.Of the two bridges shown on the body, the one
situated nearest the middle was formed by a wheel in the inside, which
projected through the sound-board.The wheel which slightly touched
the strings vibrated them by friction when turned by the handle at
the end.The order of intervals was _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _a_,
_b-flat_, _b-natural_, _c_, and were obtainable on the highest string.There is reason to suppose that the other two strings were generally
tuned a fifth and an octave below the highest.The _organistrum_ may
be regarded as the predecessor of the hurdy-gurdy, and was a rather
cumbrous contrivance.Two persons seem to have been required to sound
it, one to turn the handle and the other to manage the keys.Thus it is
generally represented in mediæval concerts.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _monochord_ (p.100) was mounted with a single string stretched
over two bridges which were fixed on an oblong box.The string could be
tightened or slackened by means of a turning screw inserted into one
end of the box.The intervals of the scale were marked on the side, and
were regulated by a sort of movable bridge placed beneath the string
when required.As might be expected, the _monochord_ was chiefly used
by theorists; for any musical performance it was but little suitable.About a thousand years ago when this monochord was in use the musical
scale was diatonic, with the exception of the interval of the seventh,
which was chromatic inasmuch as both _b-flat_ and _b-natural_ formed
part of the scale.The notation on the preceding page exhibits the
compass as well as the order of intervals adhered to about the tenth
century.This ought to be borne in mind in examining the representations of
musical instruments transmitted to us from that period.As regards the wind instruments popular during the middle ages, some
were of quaint form as well as of rude construction.The _chorus_, or _choron_, had either one or two tubes, as in the
woodcut page 101.There were several varieties of this instrument;
sometimes it was constructed with a bladder into which the tube is
inserted; this kind of _chorus_ resembled the bagpipe; another kind
resembled the _poongi_ of the Hindus, mentioned page 51.The name
_chorus_ was also applied to certain stringed instruments.One of
these had much the form of the _cithara_, page 86.It appears however,
probable that _chorus_ or _choron_ originally designated a horn
(Hebrew, _Keren_; Greek, _Keras_; Latin, _cornu_).[Illustration]

The flutes of the middle ages were blown at the end, like the
flageolet.Of the _syrinx_ there are extant some illustrations of the
ninth and tenth centuries, which exhibit the instrument with a number
of tubes tied together, just like the Pandean pipe still in use.In one
specimen engraved (page 102) from a manuscript of the eleventh century
the tubes were inserted into a bowl-shaped box.This is probably the
_frestele_, _fretel_, or _fretiau_, which in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries was in favour with the French ménétriers.Some large Anglo-saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript of the
eighth century in the British museum.The largest kind of trumpet was
placed on a stand when blown.Of the _oliphant_, or hunting horn, some
fine specimens are in the South Kensington collection.The _sackbut_
(of which we give a woodcut) probably made of metal, could be drawn
out to alter the pitch of sound.The sackbut of the ninth century had,
however, a very different shape to that in use about three centuries
ago, and much more resembled the present _trombone_.The name _sackbut_
is supposed to be a corruption of _sambuca_.The French, about the
fifteenth century, called it _sacqueboute_ and _saquebutte_.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The most important wind instrument--in fact, the king of all the
musical instruments--is the organ.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _pneumatic organ_ is sculptured on an obelisk which was erected
in Constantinople under Theodosius the great, towards the end of the
fourth century.The bellows were pressed by men standing on them:
see page 103.This interesting monument also exhibits performers on
the double flute.The _hydraulic organ_, which is recorded to have
been already known about two hundred years before the Christian era,
was according to some statements occasionally employed in churches
during the earlier centuries of the middle ages.Probably it was more
frequently heard in secular entertainments for which it was more
suitable; and at the beginning of the fourteenth century appears to
have been entirely supplanted by the pneumatic organ.The earliest
organs had only about a dozen pipes.The largest, which were made
about nine hundred years ago, had only three octaves, in which the
chromatic intervals did not occur.Some progress in the construction
of the organ is exhibited in an illustration (engraved p.104) dating
from the twelfth century, in a psalter of Eadwine, in the library of
Trinity college, Cambridge.The instrument has ten pipes, or perhaps
fourteen, as four of them appear to be double pipes.It required four
men exerting all their power to produce the necessary wind, and two men
to play the instrument.Moreover, both players seem also to be busily
engaged in directing the blowers about the proper supply of wind.It must be admitted that since the twelfth
century some progress has been made, at all events, in the construction
of the organ.[Illustration]

The pedal is generally believed to have been invented by Bernhard, a
German, who lived in Venice about the year 1470.There are, however,
indications extant pointing to an earlier date of its invention.Perhaps Bernhard was the first who, by adopting a more practicable
construction, made the pedal more generally known.On the earliest
organs the keys of the finger-board were of enormous size, compared
with those of the present day; so that a finger-board with only nine
keys had a breadth of from four to five feet.The organist struck the
keys down with his fist, as is done in playing the _carillon_ still in
use on the continent, of which presently some account will be given.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Of the little portable organ, known as the _regal_ or _regals_,
often tastefully shaped and embellished, some interesting sculptured
representations are still extant in the old ecclesiastical edifices
of England and Scotland.There is, for instance, in Beverley minster
a figure of a man playing on a single regal, or a regal provided
with only one set of pipes; and in Melrose abbey the figure of an
angel holding in his arms a double regal, the pipes of which are in
two sets.The regal generally had keys like those of the organ but
smaller.A painting in the national Gallery, by Melozzo da Forli
who lived in the fifteenth century, contains a regal which has keys
of a peculiar shape, rather resembling the pistons of certain brass
instruments.To avoid misapprehension, it is necessary to mention that the name
_regal_ (or _regals_, _rigols_) was also applied to an instrument
of percussion with sonorous slabs of wood.This contrivance was, in
short, a kind of harmonica, resembling in shape as well as in the
principle of its construction the little glass harmonica, a mere toy,
in which slips of glass are arranged according to our musical scale.In England it appears to have been still known in the beginning of the
eighteenth century.Grassineau describes the “Rigols” as “a kind of
musical instrument consisting of several sticks bound together, only
separated by beads.It makes a tolerable harmony, being well struck
with a ball at the end of a stick.” In the earlier centuries of the
middle ages there appear to have been some instruments of percussion in
favour, to which Grassineau’s expression “a tolerable harmony” would
scarcely have been applicable.Drums, of course, were known; and their
rhythmical noise must have been soft music, compared with the shrill
sounds of the _cymbalum_; a contrivance consisting of a number of metal
plates suspended on cords, so that they could be clashed together
simultaneously; or with the clangour of the _cymbalum_ constructed
with bells instead of plates; or with the piercing noise of the
_bunibulum_, or _bombulom_; an instrument which consisted of an angular
frame to which were loosely attached metal plates of various shapes
and sizes.The lower part of the frame constituted the handle: and to
produce the noise it evidently was shaken somewhat like the sistrum of
the ancient Egyptians.[Illustration]

The _triangle_ nearly resembled the instrument of this name in use
at the present day; it was more elegant in shape and had some metal
ornamentation in the middle.The _tintinnabulum_ consisted of a number of bells arranged in regular
order and suspended in a frame.[Illustration]




CHAPTER IX.Respecting the orchestras, or musical bands, represented on monuments
of the middle ages, there can hardly be a doubt that the artists who
sculptured them were not unfrequently led by their imagination rather
than by an adherence to actual fact.It is, however, not likely that
they introduced into such representations instruments that were never
admitted in the orchestras, and which would have appeared inappropriate
to the contemporaries of the artists.An examination of one or two
of the orchestras may therefore find a place here, especially as
they throw some additional light upon the characteristics of the
instrumental music of mediæval time.A very interesting group of music performers dating, it is said, from
the end of the eleventh century is preserved in a bas-relief which
formerly ornamented the abbey of St.Georges de Boscherville and which
is now removed to the museum of Rouen.The orchestra comprises twelve
performers, most of whom wear a crown.The first of them plays upon
a viol, which he holds between his knees as the violoncello is held.His instrument is scarcely as large as the smallest viola da gamba.By
his side are a royal lady and her attendant, the former playing on an
_organistrum_ of which the latter is turning the wheel.Next to these
is represented a performer on a _syrinx_ of the kind shown in the
engraving p.112; and next to him a performer on a stringed instrument
resembling a lute, which, however, is too much dilapidated to be
recognisable.Then we have a musician with a small stringed instrument
resembling the _nablum_, p.The next musician, also represented as
a royal personage, plays on a small species of harp.Then follows a
crowned musician playing the viol which he holds in almost precisely
the same manner as the violin is held.Again, another, likewise
crowned, plays upon a harp, using with the right hand a plectrum
and with the left hand merely his fingers.The last two performers,
apparently a gentleman and a gentlewoman, are engaged in striking the
_tintinnabulum_,--a set of bells in a frame.[Illustration]

In this group of crowned minstrels the sculptor has introduced a
tumbler standing on his head, perhaps the vocalist of the company, as
he has no instrument to play upon.Possibly the sculptor desired to
symbolise the hilarious effects which music is capable of producing, as
well as its elevating influence upon the devotional feelings.[Illustration]

The two positions in which we find the viol held is worthy of notice,
inasmuch as it refers the inquirer further back than might be expected
for the origin of our peculiar method of holding the violin, and the
violoncello, in playing.There were several kinds of the viol in use
differing in size and in compass of sound.The most common number of
strings was five, and it was tuned in various ways.One kind had a
string tuned to the note [Illustration] running at the side of the
finger-board instead of over it; this string was, therefore, only
capable of producing a single tone.The four other strings were tuned
thus: [Illustration] Two other species, on which all the strings
were placed over the finger-board, were tuned: [Illustration] and:
[Illustration] The woodcut above represents a very beautiful _vielle_;
French, of about 1550, with monograms of Henry II.The contrivance of placing a string or two at the side of the
finger-board is evidently very old, and was also gradually adopted on
other instruments of the violin class of a somewhat later period than
that of the _vielle_; for instance, on the _lira di braccio_ of the
Italians.It was likewise adopted on the lute, to obtain a fuller power
in the bass; and hence arose the _theorbo_, the _archlute_, and other
varieties of the old lute.[Illustration:

  A. REID.ORCHESTRA, TWELFTH CENTURY, AT SANTIAGO.]A grand assemblage of musical performers is represented on the
Portico della gloria of the famous pilgrimage church of Santiago da
Compostella, in Spain.This triple portal, which is stated by an
inscription on the lintel to have been executed in the year 1188,
consists of a large semicircular arch with a smaller arch on either
side.The central arch is filled by a tympanum, round which are
twenty-four life-sized seated figures, in high relief, representing the
twenty-four elders seen by St.John in the Apocalypse, each with an
instrument of music.These instruments are carefully represented and
are of great interest as showing those in use in Spain at about the
twelfth century.A cast of this sculpture is in the Kensington museum.In examining the group of musicians on this sculpture the reader will
probably recognise several instruments in their hands, which are
identical with those already described in the preceding pages.The
_organistrum_, played by two persons, is placed in the centre of the
group, perhaps owing to its being the largest of the instruments rather
than that it was distinguished by any superiority in sound or musical
effect.Besides the small harp seen in the hands of the eighth and
nineteenth musicians (in form nearly identical with the Anglo-saxon
harp) we find a small triangular harp, without a front-pillar, held on
the lap by the fifth and eighteenth musicians.The _salterio_ on the
lap of the tenth and seventeenth musicians resembles the dulcimer, but
seems to be played with the fingers instead of with hammers.The most
interesting instrument in this orchestra is the _vihuela_, or Spanish
viol, of the twelfth century.The first, second, third, sixth, seventh,
ninth, twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth
musicians are depicted with a _vihuela_ which bears a close resemblance
to the _rebec_.The instrument is represented with three strings,
although in one or two instances five tuning-pegs are indicated.A
large species of _vihuela_ is given to the eleventh, fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth musicians.This instrument differs from the
_rebec_ in as far as its body is broader and has incurvations at the
sides.Also the sound-holes are different in form and position.The bow
does not occur with any of these viols.But, as will be observed, the
musicians are not represented in the act of playing; they are tuning
and preparing for the performance, and the second of them is adjusting
the bridge of his instrument.[Illustration: FRONT OF THE MINSTRELS’ GALLERY, EXETER CATHEDRAL.The minstrels’ gallery of Exeter cathedral dates from the fourteenth
century.The front is divided into twelve niches, each of which
contains a winged figure or an angel playing on an instrument of music.There is a cast also of this famous sculpture at South Kensington.The
instruments are so much dilapidated that some of them cannot be clearly
recognized; but, as far as may be ascertained, they appear to be as
follows:--1.The _clarion_, a small
trumpet having a shrill sound.The _gittern_, a
small guitar strung with catgut.The _timbrel_;
resembling our present tambourine, with a double row of gingles._Cymbals._ Most of these instruments have been already noticed in the
preceding pages.The _shalm_, or _shawm_, was a pipe with a reed in
the mouth-hole.The _wait_ was an English wind instrument of the same
construction.If it differed in any respect from the _shalm_, the
difference consisted probably in the size only.The _wait_ obtained its
name from being used principally by watchmen, or _waights_, to proclaim
the time of night.Such were the poor ancestors of our fine oboe and
clarinet.CHAPTER X.


POST-MEDIÆVAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.Attention must now be drawn to some instruments which originated during
the middle ages, but which attained their highest popularity at a
somewhat later period.[Illustration]

Among the best known of these was the _virginal_, of which we give an
engraving from a specimen of the time of Elizabeth at South Kensington.Another was the _lute_, which about three hundred years ago was almost
as popular as is at the present day the pianoforte.Originally it had
eight thin catgut strings arranged in four pairs, each pair being tuned
in unison; so that its open strings produced four tones; but in the
course of time more strings were added.Until the sixteenth century
twelve was the largest number or, rather, six pairs.Eleven appear
for some centuries to have been the most usual number of strings:
these produced six tones, since they were arranged in five pairs and a
single string.The latter, called the _chanterelle_, was the highest.According to Thomas Mace, the English lute in common use during the
seventeenth century had twenty-four strings, arranged in twelve pairs,
of which six pairs ran over the finger-board and the other six by
the side of it.This lute was therefore, more properly speaking, a
theorbo.The neck of the lute, and also of the theorbo, had frets
consisting of catgut strings tightly fastened round it at the proper
distances required for ensuring a chromatic succession of intervals.The illustration on the next page represents a lute-player of the
sixteenth century.The frets are not indicated in the old engraving
from which the illustration has been taken.The order of tones adopted
for the open strings varied in different centuries and countries:
and this was also the case with the notation of lute music.The most
common practice was to write the music on six lines, the upper line
representing the first string; the second line, the second string, &c.,
and to mark with letters on the lines the frets at which the fingers
ought to be placed--_a_ indicating the open string, _b_ the first fret,
_c_ the second fret, and so on.The lute was made of various sizes according to the purpose for
which it was intended in performance.The treble-lute was of the
smallest dimensions, and the bass-lute of the largest.The _theorbo_,
or double-necked lute which appears to have come into use during
the sixteenth century, had in addition to the strings situated over
the finger-board a number of others running at the left side of
the finger-board which could not be shortened by the fingers, and
which produced the bass tones.The largest kinds of theorbo were the
_archlute_ and the _chitarrone_.It is unnecessary to enter here into a detailed description of some
other instruments which have been popular during the last three
centuries, for the museum at Kensington contains specimens of many
of them of which an account is given in the large catalogue of that
collection.It must suffice to refer the reader to the illustrations
there of the cither, virginal, spinet, clavichord, harpsichord, and
other antiquated instruments much esteemed by our forefathers.Students who examine these old relics will probably wish to know
something about their quality of tone.Might
they still be made effective in our present state of the art?” are
questions which naturally occur to the musical inquirer having such
instruments brought before him.A few words bearing on these questions
may therefore not be out of place here.[Illustration]

It is generally and justly admitted that in no other branch of the art
of music has greater progress been made since the last century than
in the construction of musical instruments.Nevertheless, there are
people who think that we have also lost something here which might
with advantage be restored.Our various instruments by being more and
more perfected are becoming too much alike in quality of sound, or in
that character of tone which the French call _timbre_, and the Germans
_Klangfarbe_, and which professor Tyndall in his lectures on sound has
translated _clang-tint_.Every musical composer knows how much more
suitable one _clang-tint_ is for the expression of a certain emotion
than another.Our old instruments, imperfect though they were in many
respects, possessed this variety of _clang-tint_ to a high degree.Neither were they on this account less capable of expression than the
modern ones.That no improvement has been made during the last two
centuries in instruments of the violin class is a well-known fact.As
to lutes and cithers the collection at Kensington contains specimens
so rich and mellow in tone as to cause musicians to regret that these
instruments have entirely fallen into oblivion.As regards beauty of appearance our earlier instruments were certainly
superior to the modern.Indeed, we have now scarcely a musical
instrument which can be called beautiful.The old lutes, spinets,
viols, dulcimers, &c., are not only elegant in shape but are also often
tastefully ornamented with carvings, designs in marquetry, and painting.[Illustration]

The player on the _viola da gamba_, shown in the next engraving, is
a reduced copy of an illustration in “The Division Violist,” London,
1659.It shows exactly how the frets were regulated, and how the bow
was held.The most popular instruments played with a bow, at that time,
were the _treble-viol_, the _tenor-viol_, and the _bass-viol_.It was
usual for viol players to have “a chest of viols,” a case containing
four or more viols, of different sizes.Thus, Thomas Mace in his
directions for the use of the viol, “Musick’s Monument” 1676, remarks,
“Your best provision, and most complete, will be a good chest of viols,
six in number, viz., two basses, two tenors, and two trebles, all truly
and proportionably suited.” The violist, to be properly furnished with
his requirements, had therefore to supply himself with a larger stock
of instruments than the violinist of the present day.[Illustration]

That there was, in the time of Shakespeare, a musical instrument
called _recorder_ is undoubtedly known to most readers from the stage
direction in Hamlet: _Re-enter players with recorders_.But not many
are likely to have ever seen a recorder, as it has now become very
scarce: we therefore give an illustration of this old instrument, which
is copied from “The Genteel Companion; Being exact Directions for the
Recorder: etc.” London, 1683.The _bagpipe_ appears to have been from time immemorial a special
favourite instrument with the Celtic races; but it was perhaps quite as
much admired by the Slavonic nations.In Poland, and in the Ukraine,
it used to be made of the whole skin of the goat in which the shape
of the animal, whenever the bagpipe was expanded with air, appeared
fully retained, exhibiting even the head with the horns; hence the
bagpipe was called _kosa_, which signifies a goat.120
represents a Scotch bagpipe of the last century.The bagpipe is of high antiquity in Ireland, and is alluded to in Irish
poetry and prose said to date from the tenth century.A pig gravely
engaged in playing the bagpipe is represented in an illuminated Irish
manuscript, of the year 1300: and we give p.121 a copy of a woodcut
from “The Image of Ireland,” a book printed in London in 1581.[Illustration]

The _bell_ has always been so much in popular favour in England that
some account of it must not be omitted.Paul Hentzner a German, who
visited England in the year 1598, records in his journal: “The people
are vastly fond of great noises that fill the ear, such as the firing
of cannon, drums, and the ringing of bells; so that in London it is
common for a number of them that have got a glass in their heads to go
up into some belfry, and ring the bells for hours together for the sake
of exercise.” This may be exaggeration,--not unusual with travellers.It is, however, a fact that bell-ringing has been a favourite amusement
with Englishmen for centuries.The way in which church bells are suspended and fastened, so as to
permit of their being made to vibrate in the most effective manner
without damaging by their vibration the building in which they are
placed, is in some countries very peculiar.The Italian _campanile_, or
tower of bells, is not unfrequently separated from the church itself.In Servia the church bells are often hung in a frame-work of timber
built near the west end of the church.In Zante and other islands of
Greece the belfry is usually separate from the church.The reason
assigned by the Greeks for having adopted this plan is that in case
of an earthquake the bells are likely to fall and, were they placed
in a tower, would destroy the roof of the church and might cause the
destruction of the whole building.Also in Russia a special edifice
for the bells is generally separate from the church.In the Russian
villages the bells are not unfrequently hung in the branches of an
oak-tree near the church.In Iceland the bell is usually placed in the
lych-gate leading to the graveyard.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The idea of forming of a number of bells a musical instrument such
as the _carillon_ is said by some to have suggested itself first to
the English and Dutch; but what we have seen in Asiatic countries
sufficiently refutes this.Moreover, not only the Romans employed
variously arranged and attuned bells, but also among the Etruscan
antiquities an instrument has been discovered which is constructed of
a number of bronze vessels placed in a row on a metal rod.Numerous
bells, varying in size and tone, have also been found in Etruscan
tombs.Among the later contrivances of this kind in European countries
the sets of bells suspended in a wooden frame, which we find in
mediæval illuminations, deserve notice.In the British museum is a
manuscript of the fourteenth century in which king David is depicted
holding in each hand a hammer with which he strikes upon bells of
different dimensions, suspended on a wooden stand.It may be supposed that the device of playing tunes by means of bells
merely swung by the hand is also of ancient date.In Lancashire each
of the ringers manages two bells, holding one in either hand.Thus, an
assemblage of seven ringers insures fourteen different tones; and as
each ringer may change his two notes by substituting two other bells if
required, even compositions with various modulations, and of a somewhat
intricate character, may be executed,--provided the ringers are good
timeists; for each has, of course, to take care to fall in with his
note, just as a member of the Russian horn band contributes his single
note whenever it occurs.Peal-ringing is another pastime of the kind which may be regarded as
pre-eminently national to England.The bells constituting a peal are
frequently of the number of eight, attuned to the diatonic scale.Also
peals of ten bells, and even of twelve, are occasionally formed.A
peculiar feature of peal-ringing is that the bells, which are provided
with clappers, are generally swung so forcibly as to raise the mouth
completely upwards.The largest peal, and one of the finest, is at
Exeter cathedral: another celebrated one is that of St.Margaret’s,
Leicester, which consists of ten bells.Peal-ringing is of an early
date in England; Egelric, abbot of Croyland, is recorded to have cast
about the year 960 a set of six bells.The _carillon_ (engraved on the opposite page) is especially popular
in the Netherlands and Belgium, but is also found in Germany, Italy,
and some other European countries.It is generally placed in the church
tower and also sometimes in other public edifices.The statement
repeated by several writers that the first carillon was invented in
the year 1481 in the town of Alost is not to be trusted, for the town
of Bruges claims to have possessed similar chimes in the year 1300.There are two kinds of carillons in use on the continent, viz.: clock
chimes, which are moved by machinery, like a self-acting barrel-organ;
and such as are provided with a set of keys, by means of which the
tunes are played by a musician.The carillon in the ‘Parochial-Kirche’
at Berlin, which is one of the finest in Germany, contains thirty-seven
bells; and is provided with a key-board for the hands and with a pedal,
which together place at the disposal of the performer a compass of
rather more than three octaves.The keys of the manual are metal rods
somewhat above a foot in length; and are pressed down with the palms of
the hand.The keys of the pedal are of wood; the instrument requires
not only great dexterity but also a considerable physical power.It
is astonishing how rapidly passages can be executed upon it by the
player, who is generally the organist of the church in which he acts as
_carilloneur_.When engaged in the last-named capacity he usually wears
leathern gloves to protect his fingers, as they are otherwise apt to
become ill fit for the more delicate treatment of the organ.The want of a contrivance in the _carillon_ for stopping the vibration
has the effect of making rapid passages, if heard near, sound as a
confused noise; only at some distance are they tolerable.It must be
remembered that the _carillon_ is intended especially to be heard from
a distance.Successions of tones which form a consonant chord, and
which have some duration, are evidently the most suitable for this
instrument.Indeed, every musical instrument possesses certain characteristics
which render it especially suitable for the production of some
particular effects.The invention of a new instrument of music has,
therefore, not unfrequently led to the adoption of new effects in
compositions.Take the pianoforte, which was invented in the beginning
of the eighteenth century, and which has now obtained so great a
popularity: its characteristics inspired our great composers to the
invention of effects, or expressions, which cannot be properly rendered
on any other instrument, however superior in some respects it may be to
the pianoforte.Thus also the improvements which have been made during
the present century in the construction of our brass instruments, and
the invention of several new brass instruments, have evidently been
not without influence upon the conceptions displayed in our modern
orchestral works.Imperfect though this essay may be it will probably have convinced
the reader that a reference to the history of the music of different
nations elucidates many facts illustrative of our own musical
instruments, which to the unprepared observer must appear misty and
impenetrable.In truth, it is with this study as with any other
scientific pursuit.The unassisted eye sees only faint nebulæ where
with the aid of the telescope bright stars are revealed.Al-Farabi, a great performer on the lute, 57

Transcriber's note:

Inconsistent punctuation and capitalization are as in the original.Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.Not I, who am but a broken boat,
   Content for a while to drift afloat
   In the little noontide of love's delights
             Between two Nights.Valgovind's Boat Song

   Waters glisten and sunbeams quiver,
             The wind blows fresh and free.Take my boat to your breast, O River!This land is laden with fruit and grain,
             With never a place left free for flowers,
   A fruitful mother; but I am fain
             For brides in their early bridal hours.Take my boat to your breast, O River!The Sea, beloved by a thousand ships,
             Is maiden ever, and fresh and free.Ah, for the touch of her cool green lips,
             Carry me out to Sea!Take my boat to your breast, dear River,
             And carry it out to Sea!Kashmiri Song by Juma

   You never loved me, and yet to save me,
   One unforgetable night you gave me
   Such chill embraces as the snow-covered heights
   Receive from clouds, in northern, Auroral nights.Such keen communion as the frozen mere
   Has with immaculate moonlight, cold and clear.And all desire,
   Like failing fire,
   Died slowly, faded surely, and sank to rest
   Against the delicate chillness of your breast.Zira: in Captivity

   Love me a little, Lord, or let me go,
   I am so weary walking to and fro
   Through all your lonely halls that were so sweet
   Did they but echo to your coming feet.When by the flowered scrolls of lace-like stone
   Our women's windows--I am left alone,
   Across the yellow Desert, looking forth,
   I see the purple hills towards the north.Behind those jagged Mountains' lilac crest
   Once lay the captive bird's small rifled nest.There was my brother slain, my sister bound;
   His blood, her tears, drunk by the thirsty ground.Then, while the burning village smoked on high,
   And desecrated all the peaceful sky,
   They took us captive, us, born frank and free,
   On fleet, strong camels through the sandy sea.Yet, when we rested, night-times, on the sand
   By the rare waters of this dreary land,
   Our captors, ere the camp was wrapped in sleep,
   Talked, and I listened, and forgot to weep.they asked, "our King,
   Slender as one tall palm-tree by a spring;
   Erect, serene, with gravely brilliant eyes,
   As deeply dark as are these desert skies."Truly no bitter fate," they said, and smiled,
   "Awaits the beauty of this captured child!"Then something in my heart began to sing,
   And secretly I longed to see the King.Sometimes the other maidens sat in tears,
   Sometimes, consoled, they jested at their fears,
   Musing what lovers Time to them would bring;
   But I was silent, thinking of the King.Till, when the weary endless sands were passed,
   When, far to south, the city rose at last,
   All speech forsook me and my eyelids fell,
   Since I already loved my Lord so well.Then the division: some were sent away
   To merchants in the city; some, they say,
   To summer palaces, beyond the walls.But me they took straight to the Sultan's halls.Every morning I would wake and say
   "Ah, sisters, shall I see our Lord to-day?"The women robed me, perfumed me, and smiled;
   "When were his feet unfleet to pleasure, child?"And tales they told me of his deeds in war,
   Of how his name was reverenced afar;
   And, crouching closer in the lamp's faint glow,
   They told me of his beauty, speaking low.the women wasted art;
   I love you with every fibre of my heart
   Already.when did I _not_ love you,
   In life, in death, when shall I not love you?All day long I lie
   Watching the changes of the far-off sky
   Behind the lattice-work of carven stone.Ah, my Lord the King,
   How can you find it well to do this thing?Come once, come only: sometimes, as I lie,
   I doubt if I shall see you first, or die.Ah, could I hear your footsteps at the door
   Hallow the lintel and caress the floor,
   Then I might drink your beauty, satisfied,
   Die of delight, ere you could reach my side.Alas, you come not, Lord: life's flame burns low,
   Faint for a loveliness it may not know,
   Faint for your face, Oh, come--come soon to me--
   Lest, though you should not, Death should, set me free!Marriage Thoughts: by Morsellin Khan

   _Bridegroom_
   I give you my house and my lands, all golden with harvest;
   My sword, my shield, and my jewels, the spoils of my strife,
   My strength and my dreams, and aught I have gathered of glory,
   And to-night--to-night, I shall give you my very life._Bride_
   I may not raise my eyes, O my Lord, towards you,
   And I may not speak: what matter?But through my downcast lashes, feeling your beauty,
   I shiver and burn with pleasure beneath my veil._Younger Sisters_
   We throw sweet perfume upon her head,
   And delicate flowers round her bed.Ah, would that it were our turn to wed!_Mother_
   I see my daughter, vaguely, through my tears,
   (Ah, lost caresses of my early years!)I see the bridegroom, King of men in truth!(Ah, my first lover, and my vanished youth!)_Bride_
   Almost I dread this night.How shall I dare to clasp a thing so dear?Many have feared your name, but I your beauty.Lord of my life, be gentle to my fear!_Younger Sisters_
   In the softest silk is our sister dressed,
   With silver rubies upon her breast,
   Where a dearer treasure to-night will rest._Dancing Girls_
   See!his hair is like silk, and his teeth are whiter
   Than whitest of jasmin flowers.I would change my jewels against his caresses.Verily, sisters, this marriage is greatly a loss to us!_Bride_
   Would that the music ceased and the night drew round us,
   With solitude, shadow, and sound of closing doors,
   So that our lips might meet and our beings mingle,
   While mine drank deep of the essence, beloved, of yours._Passing mendicant_
   Out of the joy of your marriage feast,
     Oh, brothers, be good to me.The way is long and the Shrine is far,
     Where my weary feet would be.And feasting is always somewhat sad
     To those outside the door--
   Still; Love is only a dream, and Life
     Itself is hardly more!To the Unattainable:

   Lament of Mahomed Akram

   I would have taken Golden Stars from the sky for your necklace,
   I would have shaken rose-leaves for your rest from all the rose-trees.But you had no need; the short sweet grass sufficed for your slumber,
   And you took no heed of such trifles as gold or a necklace.There is an hour, at twilight, too heavy with memory.There is a flower that I fear, for your hair had its fragrance.I would have squandered Youth for you, and its hope and its promise,
   Before you wandered, careless, away from my useless passion.But what is the use of my speech, since I know of no words to recall you?I am praying that Time may teach, you, your Cruelty, me, Forgetfulness.Mahomed Akram's Appeal to the Stars

   Oh, Silver Stars that shine on what I love,
     Touch the soft hair and sparkle in the eyes,--
   Send, from your calm serenity above,
     Sleep to whom, sleepless, here, despairing lies.Broken, forlorn, upon the Desert sand
     That sucks these tears, and utterly abased,
   Looking across the lonely, level land,
     With thoughts more desolate than any waste.Planets that shine on what I so adore,
     Now thrown, the hour is late, in careless rest,
   Protect that sleep, which I may watch no more,
     I, the cast out, dismissed and dispossessed.Far in the hillside camp, in slumber lies
     What my worn eyes worship but never see.your myriad silver eyes
     Feast on the quiet face denied to me.Loved with a love beyond all words or sense,
     Lost with a grief beyond the saltest tear,
   So lovely, so removed, remote, and hence
     So doubly and so desperately dear!from your skies so purple and so calm,
     That through the centuries your secrets keep,
   Send to this worn-out brain some Occult Balm,
     Send me, for many nights so sleepless, sleep.And ere the sunshine of the Desert jars
     My sense with sorrow and another day,
   Through your soft Magic, oh, my Silver Stars!Reminiscence of Mahomed Akram

   I shall never forget you, never.Never escape
   Your memory woven about the beautiful things of life.The sudden Thought of your Face is like a Wound
             When it comes unsought
   On some scent of Jasmin, Lilies, or pale Tuberose.Any one of the sweet white fragrant flowers,
   Flowers I used to love and lay in your hair.I saw you stand
   Tall against the red and the gold like a slender palm;
   The light wind stirred your hair as you waved your hand,
   Waved farewell, as ever, serene and calm,
   To me, the passion-wearied and tost and torn,
   Riding down the road in the gathering grey.Since that day
   The sunset red is empty, the gold forlorn.Often across the Banqueting board at nights
   Men linger about your name in careless praise
   The name that cuts deep into my soul like a knife;
   And the gay guest-faces and flowers and leaves and lights
   Fade away from the failing sense in a haze,
             And the music sways
   Far away in unmeasured distance....
             I cannot forget--
   I cannot escape.Stars that meant so much, too much, in my youth;
   Stars that sparkled about your eyes,
   Made a radiance round your hair,
             What are they now?Lingering lights of a Finished Feast,
   Little lingering sparks rather,
             Of a Light that is long gone out.Story by Lalla-ji, the Priest

   He loved the Plant with a keen delight,
     A passionate fervour, strange to see,
   Tended it ardently, day and night,
     Yet never a flower lit up the tree.The leaves were succulent, thick, and green,
     And, sessile, out of the snakelike stem
   Rose spine-like fingers, alert and keen,
     To catch at aught that molested them.But though they nurtured it day and night,
     With love and labour, the child and he
   Were never granted the longed-for sight
     Of a flower crowning the twisted tree.Until one evening a wayworn Priest
     Stopped for the night in the Temple shade
   And shared the fare of their simple feast
     Under the vines and the jasmin laid.He, later, wandering round the flowers
     Paused awhile by the blossomless tree.The man said, "May it be fault of ours,
     That never its buds my eyes may see?"Aslip it came from the further East
     Many a sunlit summer ago.""It grows in our Jungles," said the Priest,
     "Men see it rarely; but this I know,

   "The Jungle people worship it; say
     They bury a child around its roots--
   Bury it living:--the only way
     To crimson glory of flowers and fruits."He spoke in whispers; his furtive glance
     Probing the depths of the garden shade.The man came closer, with eyes askance,
     The child beside them shivered, afraid.A cold wind drifted about the three,
     Jarring the spines with a hungry sound,
   The spines that grew on the snakelike tree
     And guarded its roots beneath the ground......

   After the fall of the summer rain
     The plant was glorious, redly gay,
   Blood-red with blossom.Never again
     Men saw the child in the Temple play.Request

   Give me your self one hour; I do not crave
     For any love, or even thought, of me.Come, as a Sultan may caress a slave
     And then forget for ever, utterly.as west winds, that passing, cool and wet,
     O'er desert places, leave them fields in flower
   And all my life, for I shall not forget,
     Will keep the fragrance of that perfect hour!Story of Udaipore:

   Told by Lalla-ji, the Priest

         "And when the Summer Heat is great,
           And every hour intense,
         The Moghra, with its subtle flowers,
           Intoxicates the sense."The Coco palms stood tall and slim, against the golden-glow,
   And all their grey and graceful plumes were waving to and fro.She lay forgetful in the boat, and watched the dying Sun
   Sink slowly lakewards, while the stars replaced him, one by one.She saw the marble Temple walls long white reflections make,
   The echoes of their silvery bells were blown across the lake.The evening air was very sweet; from off the island bowers
   Came scents of Moghra trees in bloom, and Oleander flowers."The Moghra flowers that smell so sweet
           When love's young fancies play;
         The acrid Moghra flowers, still sweet
           Though love be burnt away."The boat went drifting, uncontrolled, the rower rowed no more,
   But deftly turned the slender prow towards the further shore.The dying sunset touched with gold the Jasmin in his hair;
   His eyes were darkly luminous: she looked and found him fair.And so persuasively he spoke, she could not say him nay,
   And when his young hands took her own, she smiled and let them stay.And all the youth awake in him, all love of Love in her,
   All scents of white and subtle flowers that filled the twilight air

   Combined together with the night in kind conspiracy
   To do Love service, while the boat went drifting onwards, free."The Moghra flowers, the Moghra flowers,
           While Youth's quick pulses play
         They are so sweet, they still are sweet,
           Though passion burns away."Low in the boat the lovers lay, and from his sable curls
   The Jasmin flowers slipped away to rest among the girl's.Oh, silver lake and silver night and tender silver sky!Where as the hours passed, the moon rose white and cold on high."The Moghra flowers, the Moghra flowers,
           So dear to Youth at play;
         The small and subtle Moghra flowers
           That only last a day."Suddenly, frightened, she awoke, and waking vaguely saw
   The boat had stranded in the sedge that fringed the further shore.The breeze grown chilly, swayed the palms; she heard, still half awake,
   A prowling jackal's hungry cry blown faintly o'er the lake.She shivered, but she turned to kiss his soft, remembered face,
   Lit by the pallid light he lay, in Youth's abandoned grace.But as her lips met his she paused, in terror and dismay,
   The white moon showed her by her side asleep a Leper lay."Ah, Moghra flowers, white Moghra flowers,
           All love is blind, they say;
         The Moghra flowers, so sweet, so sweet,
           Though love be burnt away!"Valgovind's Song in the Spring

   The Temple bells are ringing,
   The young green corn is springing,
         And the marriage month is drawing very near.I lie hidden in the grass,
   And I count the moments pass,
         For the month of marriages is drawing near.Soon, ah, soon, the women spread
   The appointed bridal bed
         With hibiscus buds and crimson marriage flowers,

   Where, when all the songs are done,
   And the dear dark night begun,
         I shall hold her in my happy arms for hours.She is young and very sweet,
   From the silver on her feet
         To the silver and the flowers in her hair,
   And her beauty makes me swoon,
   As the Moghra trees at noon
         Intoxicate the hot and quivering air.Ah, I would the hours were fleet
   As her silver circled feet,
         I am weary of the daytime and the night;
   I am weary unto death,
   Oh my rose with jasmin breath,
         With this longing for your beauty and your light.Youth

   I am not sure if I knew the truth
     What his case or crime might be,
   I only know that he pleaded Youth,
     A beautiful, golden plea!Youth, with its sunlit, passionate eyes,
     Its roseate velvet skin--
   A plea to cancel a thousand lies,
     Or a thousand nights of sin.The men who judged him were old and grey
     Their eyes and their senses dim,
   He brought the light of a warm Spring day
     To the Court-house bare and grim.Could he plead guilty in a lovelier way?When Love is Over

   Song of Khan Zada

   Only in August my heart was aflame,
     Catching the scent of your Wind-stirred hair,
   Now, though you spread it to soften my sleep
     Through the night, I should hardly care.Only last August I drank that water
     Because it had chanced to cool your hands;
   When love is over, how little of love
     Even the lover understands!"Golden Eyes"

   Oh Amber Eyes, oh Golden Eyes!Wherein swift fancies fall and rise,
     Grow dark and fade away.Eyes like a little limpid pool
     That holds a sunset sky,
   While on its surface, calm and cool,
     Blue water lilies lie.Oh Tender Eyes, oh Wistful Eyes,
     You smiled on me one day,
   And all my life, in glad surprise,
     Leapt up and pleaded "Stay!"Alas, oh cruel, starlike eyes,
     So grave and yet so gay,
   You went to lighten other skies,
     Smiled once and passed away.Oh, you whom I name "Golden Eyes,"
     Perhaps I used to know
   Your beauty under other skies
     In lives lived long ago.Perhaps I rowed with galley slaves,
     Whose labour never ceased,
   To bring across Phoenician waves
     Your treasure from the East.Maybe you were an Emperor then
     And I a favourite slave;
   Some youth, whom from the lions' den
     You vainly tried to save!Maybe I reigned, a mighty King,
     The early nations knew,
   And you were some slight captive thing,
     Some maiden whom I slew.Perhaps, adrift on desert shores
     Beside some shipwrecked prow,
   I gladly gave my life for yours.Or on some sacrificial stone
     Strange Gods we satisfied,
   Perhaps you stooped and left a throne
     To kiss me ere I died.Perhaps, still further back than this,
     In times ere men were men,
   You granted me a moment's bliss
     In some dark desert den,
   When, with your amber eyes alight
     With iridescent flame,
   And fierce desire for love's delight,
     Towards my lair you came

   Ah laughing, ever-brilliant eyes,
     These things men may not know,
   But something in your radiance lies,
     That, centuries ago,
   Lit up my life in one wild blaze
     Of infinite desire
   To revel in your golden rays,
     Or in your light expire.If this, oh Strange Ringed Eyes, be true,
     That through all changing lives
   This longing love I have for you
     Eternally survives,
   May I not sometimes dare to dream
     In some far time to be
   Your softly golden eyes may gleam
     Responsively on me?Ah gentle, subtly changing eyes,
     You smiled on me one day,
   And all my life in glad surprise
     Leaped up, imploring "Stay!"Alas, alas, oh Golden Eyes,
     So cruel and so gay,
   You went to shine in other skies,
     Smiled once and passed away.Kotri, by the River

   At Kotri, by the river, when the evening's sun is low,
   The waving palm trees quiver, the golden waters glow,
   The shining ripples shiver, descending to the sea;
   At Kotri, by the river, she used to wait for me.So young, she was, and slender, so pale with wistful eyes
   As luminous and tender as Kotri's twilight skies.Her face broke into flowers, red flowers at the mouth,
   Her voice,--she sang for hours like bulbuls in the south.We sat beside the water through burning summer days,
   And many things I taught her of Life and all its ways
   Of Love, man's loveliest duty, of Passion's reckless pain,
   Of Youth, whose transient beauty comes once, but not again.She lay and laughed and listened beside the water's edge.The glancing river glistened and glinted through the sedge.Green parrots flew above her and, as the daylight died,
   Her young arms drew her lover more closely to her side.When Love would not be holden, and Pleasure had his will.Days, when in after leisure, content to rest we lay,
   Nights, when her lips' soft pressure drained all my life away.And while we sat together, beneath the Babul trees,
   The fragrant, sultry weather cooled by the river breeze,
   If passion faltered ever, and left the senses free,
   We heard the tireless river decending to the sea.I know not where she wandered, or went in after days,
   Or if her youth she squandered in Love's more doubtful ways.Perhaps, beside the river, she died, still young and fair;
   Perchance the grasses quiver above her slumber there.At Kotri, by the river, maybe I too shall sleep
   The sleep that lasts for ever, too deep for dreams; too deep.Maybe among the shingle and sand of floods to be
   Her dust and mine may mingle and float away to sea.Ah Kotri, by the river, when evening's sun is low,
   Your faint reflections quiver, your golden ripples glow.You knew, oh Kotri river, that love which could not last.For me your palms still shiver with passions of the past.Farewell

   Farewell, Aziz, it was not mine to fold you
     Against my heart for any length of days.I had no loveliness, alas, to hold you,
     No siren voice, no charm that lovers praise.Yet, in the midst of grief and desolation,
     Solace I my despairing soul with this:
   Once, for my life's eternal consolation,
     You lent my lips your loveliness to kiss.I think Love's very essence
     Distilled itself from out my joy and pain,
   Like tropical trees, whose fervid inflorescence
     Glows, gleams, and dies, never to bloom again.Often I marvel how I met the morning
     With living eyes after that night with you,
   Ah, how I cursed the wan, white light for dawning,
     And mourned the paling stars, as each withdrew!Yet I, even I, who am less than dust before you,
     Less than the lowest lintel of your door,
   Was given one breathless midnight, to adore you.Fate, having granted this, can give no more!Afridi Love

   Since, Oh, Beloved, you are not even faithful
     To me, who loved you so, for one short night,
   For one brief space of darkness, though my absence
     Did but endure until the dawning light;

   Since all your beauty--which was _mine_--you squandered
     On _that_ which now lies dead across your door;
   See here this knife, made keen and bright to kill you.You shall not see the sun rise any more.In all the empty village
     Who is there left to hear or heed your cry?All are gone to labour in the valley,
     Who will return before your time to die?No use to struggle; when I found you sleeping,
     I took your hands and bound them to your side,
   And both these slender feet, too apt at straying,
     Down to the cot on which you lie are tied.Lie still, Beloved; that dead thing lying yonder,
     I hated and I killed, but love is sweet,
   And you are more than sweet to me, who love you,
     Who decked my eyes with dust from off your feet.Give me your lips; Ah, lovely and disloyal
     Give me yourself again; before you go
   Down through the darkness of the Great, Blind Portal,
     All of life's best and basest you must know.Erstwhile Beloved, you were so young and fragile
     I held you gently, as one holds a flower:
   But now, God knows, what use to still be tender
     To one whose life is done within an hour?Death will not hurt you, dearest,
     As you hurt me, for just a single night,
   You call me cruel, who laid my life in ruins
     To gain one little moment of delight.Look up, look out, across the open doorway
     The sunlight streams.Look at the pale, pink peach trees in our garden,
     Sweet fruit will come of them;--but not for you.The fair, far snow, upon those jagged mountains
     That gnaw against the hard blue Afghan sky
   Will soon descend, set free by summer sunshine.You will not see those torrents sweeping by.From this day forward,
     You must lie still alone; who would not lie
   Alone for one night only, though returning
     I was, when earliest dawn should break the sky.There lies my lute, and many strings are broken,
     Some one was playing it, and some one tore
   The silken tassels round my Hookah woven;
     Some one who plays, and smokes, and loves, no more!Some one who took last night his fill of pleasure,
     As I took mine at dawn!The knife went home
   Straight through his heart!God only knows my rapture
     Bathing my chill hands in the warm red foam.This is only loving,
     Wait till I kill you!Surely the fault was mine, to love and leave you
     Even a single night, you are so fair.Cold steel is very cooling to the fervour
     Of over passionate ones, Beloved, like you.Not quite unlovely
     They are as yet, as yet, though quite untrue.What will your brother say, to-night returning
     With laden camels homewards to the hills,
   Finding you dead, and me asleep beside you,
     Will he awake me first before he kills?Here on the cot beside you
     When you, my Heart's Delight, are cold in death.When your young heart and restless lips are silent,
     Grown chilly, even beneath my burning breath.When I have slowly drawn my knife across you,
     Taking my pleasure as I see you swoon,
   I shall sleep sound, worn out by love's last fervour,
     And then, God grant your kinsmen kill me soon!Yasmini

   At night, when Passion's ebbing tide
     Left bare the Sands of Truth,
   Yasmini, resting by my side,
     Spoke softly of her youth."And one" she said "was tall and slim,
     Two crimson rose leaves made his mouth,
   And I was fain to follow him
     Down to his village in the South."He was to build a hut hard by
     The stream where palms were growing,
   We were to live, and love, and lie,
     And watch the water flowing."Ah, dear, delusive, distant shore,
     By dreams of futile fancy gilt!The riverside we never saw,
     The palm leaf hut was never built!"One had a Tope of Mangoe trees,
     Where early morning, noon and late,
   The Persian wheels, with patient ease,
     Brought up their liquid, silver freight."And he was fain to rise and reach
     That garden sloping to the sea,
   Whose groves along the wave-swept beach
     Should shelter him and love and me."Doubtless, upon that western shore
     With ripe fruit falling to the ground,
   There dwells the Peace he hungered for,
     The lovely Peace we never found."Then there came one with eager eyes
     And keen sword, ready for the fray.He missed the storms of Northern skies,
     The reckless raid and skirmish gay!"He rose from dreams of war's alarms,
     To make his daggers keen and bright,
   Desiring, in my very arms,
     The fiercer rapture of the fight!"He left me soon; too soon, and sought
     The stronger, earlier love again.News reached me from the Cabul Court,
     Afterwards nothing; doubtless slain."Doubtless his brilliant, haggard eyes,
     Long since took leave of life and light,
   And those lithe limbs I used to prize
     Feasted the jackal and the kite.his sixteen years
     Shone in his cheeks' transparent red.My kisses were his first: my tears
     Fell on his face when he was dead."He died, he died, I speak the truth,
     Though light love leave his memory dim,
   He was the Lover of my Youth
     And all my youth went down with him."For passion ebbs and passion flows,
     But under every new caress
   The riven heart more keenly knows
     Its own inviolate faithfulness."Our Gods are kind and still deem fit
     As in old days, with those to lie,
   Whose silent hearths are yet unlit
     By the soft light of infancy."Therefore, one strange, mysterious night
     Alone within the Temple shade,
   Recipient of a God's delight
     I lay enraptured, unafraid."Also to me the boon was given,
     But mourning quickly followed mirth,
   My son, whose father stooped from Heaven,
     Died in the moment of his birth."When from the war beyond the seas
     The reckless Lancers home returned,
   Their spoils were laid across my knees
     About my lips their kisses burned."Back from the Comradeship of Death,
     Free from the Friendship of the Sword,
   With brilliant eyes and famished breath
     They came to me for their reward."Why do I tell you all these things,
     Baring my life to you, unsought?When Passion folds his wearied wings
     Sleep should be follower, never Thought.The window pane
     Grows pale against the purple sky.The dawn is with us once again,
     The dawn; which always means good-bye."Within her little trellised room, beside the palm-fringed sea,
   She wakeful in the scented gloom, spoke of her youth to me.Ojira, to Her Lover

   I am waiting in the desert, looking out towards the sunset,
   And counting every moment till we meet.I am waiting by the marshes and I tremble and I listen
   Till the soft sands thrill beneath your coming feet.Till I see you, tall and slender, standing clear against the skyline
   A graceful shade across the lingering red,
   While your hair the breezes ruffle, turns to silver in the twilight,
   And makes a fair faint aureole round your head.Far away towards the sunset I can see a narrow river,
   That unwinds itself in red tranquillity;
   I can hear its rippled meeting, and the gurgle of its greeting,
   As it mingles with the loved and long sought sea.In the purple sky above me showing dark against the starlight,
   Long wavering flights of homeward birds fly low,
   They cry each one to the other, and their weird and wistful calling,
   Makes most melancholy music as they go.Oh, my dearest hasten, hasten!Already
   Have I heard the jackals' first assembling cry,
   And among the purple shadows of the mangroves and the marshes
   Fitful echoes of their footfalls passing by.my arms are empty, and so weary for your beauty,
   I am thirsty for the music of your voice.Come to make the marshes joyous with the sweetness of your presence,
   Let your nearing feet bid all the sands rejoice!My hands, my lips are feverish with the longing and the waiting
   And no softness of the twilight soothes their heat,
   Till I see your radiant eyes, shining stars beneath the starlight,
   Till I kiss the slender coolness of your feet.Ah, loveliest, most reluctant, when you lay yourself beside me
   All the planets reel around me--fade away,
   And the sands grow dim, uncertain,--I stretch out my hands towards you
   While I try to speak but know not what I say!I am faint with love and longing, and my burning eyes are gazing
   Where the furtive Jackals wage their famished strife,
   Oh, your shadow on the mangroves!and your step upon the sandhills,--
   This is the loveliest evening of my Life!Thoughts: Mahomed Akram

   If some day this body of mine were burned
   (It found no favour alas!with you)
   And the ashes scattered abroad, unurned,
   Would Love die also, would Thought die too?But who can answer, or who can trust,
       No dreams would harry the windblown dust?Were I laid away in the furrows deep
   Secure from jackal and passing plough,
   Would your eyes not follow me still through sleep
   Torment me then as they torture now?Would you ever have loved me, Golden Eyes,
       Had I done aught better or otherwise?Was I overspeechful, or did you yearn
   When I sat silent, for songs or speech?Ah, Beloved, I had been so apt to learn,
   So apt, had you only cared to teach.But time for silence and song is done,
       You wanted nothing, my Golden Sun!That drifts in its lonely orbit far
   Away from your soft, effulgent light
   In outer planes of Eternal night?Prayer

   You are all that is lovely and light,
     Aziza whom I adore,
   And, waking, after the night,
     I am weary with dreams of you.Every nerve in my heart is tense and sore
     As I rise to another morning apart from you.I dream of your luminous eyes,
     Aziza whom I adore!Of the ruffled silk of your hair,
   I dream, and the dreams are lies.But I love them, knowing no more
     Will ever be mine of you
   Aziza, my life's despair.I would burn for a thousand days,
   Aziza whom I adore,
   Be tortured, slain, in unheard of ways
     If you pitied the pain I bore.Your bright eyes, fastened on other things,
   Are keener to sting my soul, than scorpion stings!You are all that is lovely to me,
     All that is light,
   One white rose in a Desert of weariness.I only live in the night,
   The night, with its fair false dreams of you,
     You and your loveliness.Give me your love for a day,
             A night, an hour:
           If the wages of sin are Death
             I am willing to pay.What is my life but a breath
       Of passion burning away?O Aziza whom I adore,
     Aziza my one delight,
       Only one night, I will die before day,
     And trouble your life no more.The Aloe

   My life was like an Aloe flower, beneath an orient sky,
   Your sunshine touched it for an hour; it blossomed but to die.Torn up, cast out, on rubbish heaps where red flames work their will
   Each atom of the Aloe keeps the flower-time fragrance still.Memory

   How I loved you in your sleep,
   With the starlight on your hair!The touch of your lips was sweet,
     Aziza whom I adore,
   I lay at your slender feet,
     And against their soft palms pressed,
   I fitted my face to rest.As winds blow over the sea
     From Citron gardens ashore,
   Came, through your scented hair,
     The breeze of the night to me.My lips grew arid and dry,
     My nerves were tense,
   Though your beauty soothe the eye
     It maddens the sense.Every curve of that beauty is known to me,
   Every tint of that delicate roseleaf skin,
     And these are printed on every atom of me,
   Burnt in on every fibre until I die.And for this, my sin,
   I doubt if ever, though dust I be,
   The dust will lose the desire,
   The torment and hidden fire,
   Of my passionate love for you.Aziza whom I adore,
   My dust will be full of your beauty, as is the blue
   And infinite ocean full of the azure sky.In the light that waxed and waned
   Playing about your slumber in silver bars,
   As the palm trees swung their feathery fronds athwart the stars,
   How quiet and young you were,
   Pale as the Champa flowers, violet veined,
   That, sweet and fading, lay in your loosened hair.How sweet you were in your sleep,
   With the starlight on your hair!Your throat thrown backwards, bare,
   And touched with circling moonbeams, silver white
     On the couch's sombre shade.O Aziza my one delight,
   When Youth's passionate pulses fade,
   And his golden heart beats slow,
   When across the infinite sky
   I see the roseate glow
   Of my last, last sunset flare,
   I shall send my thoughts to this night
   And remember you as I die,
   The one thing, among all the things of this earth, found fair.How sweet you were in your sleep,
   With the starlight, silver and sable, across your hair!The First Lover

   As o'er the vessel's side she leant,
     She saw the swimmer in the sea
   With eager eyes on her intent,
     "Come down, come down and swim with me."So weary was she of her lot,
     Tired of the ship's monotony,
   She straightway all the world forgot
     Save the young swimmer in the sea

   So when the dusky, dying light
     Left all the water dark and dim,
   She softly, in the friendly night,
     Slipped down the vessel's side to him.Intent and brilliant, brightly dark,
     She saw his burning, eager eyes,
   And many a phosphorescent spark
     About his shoulders fall and rise.As through the hushed and Eastern night
     They swam together, hand in hand,
   Or lay and laughed in sheer delight
     Full length upon the level sand."Ah, soft, delusive, purple night
     Whose darkness knew no vexing moon!Ah, cruel, needless, dawning light
     That trembled in the sky too soon!"Khan Zada's Song on the Hillside

   The fires that burn on all the hills
     Light up the landscape grey,
   The arid desert land distills
     The fervours of the day.The clear white moon sails through the skies
     And silvers all the night,
   I see the brilliance of your eyes
     And need no other light.The death sighs of a thousand flowers
     The fervent day has slain
   Are wafted through the twilight hours,
     And perfume all the plain.My senses strain, and try to clasp
     Their sweetness in the air,
   In vain, in vain; they only grasp
     The fragrance of your hair.The plain is endless space expressed;
     Vast is the sky above,
   I only feel, against your breast,
     Infinities of love.Deserted Gipsy's Song: Hillside Camp

   She is glad to receive your turquoise ring,
         Dear and dark-eyed Lover of mine!I, to have given you everything:
         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine."She is proud to have held aloof her charms,
         Slender, dark-eyed Lover of mine!But I, of the night you lay in my arms:
         Beauty maddens the sense like Wine!"She triumphs to think that your heart is won,
         Stately, dark-eyed Lover of mine!I had not a thought of myself, not one:
         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"She will speak you softly, while skies are blue,
         Dear, deluded Lover of mine!I would lose both body and soul for you:
         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"While the ways are fair she will love you well,
         Dear, disdainful Lover of mine!But I would have followed you down to Hell:
         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine!"Though you lay at her feet the days to be,
         Now no longer Lover of mine!You can give her naught that you gave not me:
         Beauty maddened my soul like Wine!"When the years have shown what is false or true:
         Beauty maddens the sight like Wine!You will understand how I cared for you,
         First and only Lover of mine!"The Plains

               How one loves them
   These wide horizons; whether Desert or Sea,--
          Vague and vast and infinite; faintly clear--
   Surely, hid in the far away, unknown "There,"
          Lie the things so longed for and found not, found not, Here.Only where some passionate, level land
          Stretches itself in reaches of golden sand,
   Only where the sea line is joined to the sky-line, clear,
          Beyond the curve of ripple or white foamed crest,--
                         Shall the weary eyes
             Distressed by the broken skies,--
             Broken by Minaret, mountain, or towering tree,--
          Shall the weary eyes be assuaged,--be assuaged,--and rest."Lost Delight"

   After the Hazara War

   I lie alone beneath the Almond blossoms,
        Where we two lay together in the spring,
   And now, as then, the mountain snows are melting,
        This year, as last, the water-courses sing.That was another spring, and other flowers,
        Hung, pink and fragile, on the leafless tree,
   The land rejoiced in other running water,
        And I rejoiced, because you were with me.You, with your soft eyes, darkly lashed and shaded,
        Your red lips like a living, laughing rose,
   Your restless, amber limbs so lithe and slender
        Now lost to me.You lay beside me singing in the sunshine;
        The rough, white fur, unloosened at the neck,
   Showed the smooth skin, fair as the Almond blossoms,
        On which the sun could find no flaw or fleck.I lie alone, beneath the Almond flowers,
        I hated them to touch you as they fell.worse, Ah, worse, who loves you?(My soul is burning as men burn in Hell.)How I have sought you in the crowded cities!I have been mad, they say, for many days.I know not how I came here, to the valley,
        What fate has led me, through what doubtful ways.Somewhere I see my sword has done good service,
        Some one I killed, who, smiling, used your name,
   But in what country?Nay, I have forgotten,
        All thought is shrivelled in my heart's hot flame.Where are you now, Delight, and where your beauty,
        Your subtle curls, and laughing, changeful face?Bound, bruised and naked (dear God, grant me patience),
        And sold in Cabul in the market-place.Among so many captured, sold, or slain,
   What fate was yours?(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,
        My heart is burnt, is burnt, with fire and pain.)my heart is almost breaking,
        My sword is broken and my feet are sore,
   The people look at me and say in passing,
        "He will not leave the village any more."For as the evening falls, the fever rises,
        With frantic thoughts careering through the brain,
   Wild thoughts of you.(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,
        My soul is hurt beyond all men call pain.)I lie alone, beneath the Almond blossoms,
        And see the white snow melting on the hills
   Till Khorassan is gay with water-courses,
        Glad with the tinkling sound of running rills,

   And well I know that when the fragile petals
        Fall softly, ere the first green leaves appear,
   (Ah, for these last few days, God, grant me patience,)
        Since Delight is not, I shall not be, here!Unforgotten

   Do you ever think of me?you who died
       Ere our Youth's first fervour chilled,
   With your soft eyes and your pulses stilled
       Lying alone, aside,
   Do you ever think of me, left in the light,
   From the endless calm of your dawnless night?I am faithful always: I do not say
       That the lips which thrilled to your lips of old
   To lesser kisses are always cold;
       Had you wished for this in its narrow sense
       Our love perhaps had been less intense;
   But as we held faithfulness, you and I,
       I am faithful always, as you who lie,
       Asleep for ever, beneath the grass,
       While the days and nights and the seasons pass,--
           Pass away.I keep your memory near my heart,
       My brilliant, beautiful guiding Star,
   Till long live over, I too depart
       To the infinite night where perhaps you are.I would rather know you alive in Hell
   Than think your beauty is nothing now,
   With its deep dark eyes and tranquil brow
   Where the hair fell softly.Can this be true
   That nothing, nowhere, exists of you?Nothing, nowhere, oh, loved so well
       I have _never_ forgotten.Do you still keep
   Thoughts of me through your dreamless sleep?lost in Eternal Night,
       Lost Star of light,
   Risen splendidly, set so soon,
       Through the weariness of life's afternoon
             I dream of your memory yet.My loved and lost, whom I could not save,
   My youth went down with you to the grave,
   Though other planets and stars may rise,
   I dream of your soft and sorrowful eyes
           And I cannot forget.Song of Faiz Ulla

   Just at the time when Jasmins bloom, most sweetly in the summer weather,
   Lost in the scented Jungle gloom, one sultry night we spent together
   We, Love and Night, together blent, a Trinity of tranced content.Yet, while your lips were wholly mine, to kiss, to drink from, to caress,
   We heard some far-off faint distress; harsh drop of poison in sweet wine
   Lessening the fulness of delight,--
            Some quivering note of human pain,
   Which rose and fell and rose again, in plaintive sobs throughout the night,

   Spoiling the perfumed, moonless hours
   We spent among the Jasmin flowers.Story of Lilavanti

   They lay the slender body down
     With all its wealth of wetted hair,
   Only a daughter of the town,
     But very young and slight and fair.The eyes, whose light one cannot see,
     Are sombre doubtless, like the tresses,
   The mouth's soft curvings seem to be
     A roseate series of caresses.And where the skin has all but dried
     (The air is sultry in the room)
   Upon her breast and either side,
     It shows a soft and amber bloom.By women here, who knew her life,
     A leper husband, I am told,
   Took all this loveliness to wife
     When it was barely ten years old.And when the child in shocked dismay
     Fled from the hated husband's care
   He caught and tied her, so they say,
     Down to his bedside by her hair.To some low quarter of the town,
     Escaped a second time, she flew;
   Her beauty brought her great renown
     And many lovers here she knew,

   When, as the mystic Eastern night
     With purple shadow filled the air,
   Behind her window framed in light,
     She sat with jasmin in her hair.At last she loved a youth, who chose
     To keep this wild flower for his own,
   He in his garden set his rose
     Where it might bloom for him alone.Cholera came; her lover died,
     Want drove her to the streets again,
   And women found her there, who tried
     To turn her beauty into gain.But she who in those garden ways
     Had learnt of Love, would now no more
   Be bartered in the market place
     For silver, as in days before.That former life she strove to change;
     She sold the silver off her arms,
   While all the world grew cold and strange
     To broken health and fading charms.Till, finding lovers, but no friend,
     Nor any place to rest or hide,
   She grew despairing at the end,
     Slipped softly down a well and died.And yet, how short, when all is said,
     This little life of love and tears!Her age, they say, beside her bed,
     To-day is only fifteen years.The Garden by the Bridge

   The Desert sands are heated, parched and dreary,
     The tigers rend alive their quivering prey
   In the near Jungle; here the kites rise, weary,
     Too gorged with living food to fly away.All night the hungry jackals howl together
     Over the carrion in the river bed,
   Or seize some small soft thing of fur or feather
     Whose dying shrieks on the night air are shed.I hear from yonder Temple in the distance
     Whose roof with obscene carven Gods is piled,
   Reiterated with a sad insistence
     Sobs of, perhaps, some immolated child.Strange rites here, where the archway's shade is deeper,
     Are consummated in the river bed;
   Parias steal the rotten railway sleeper
     To burn the bodies of their cholera dead.But yet, their lust, their hunger, cannot shame them
     Goaded by fierce desire, that flays and stings;
   Poor beasts, and poorer men.Blame the Inherent Cruelty of Things.The world is horrible and I am lonely,
     Let me rest here where yellow roses bloom
   And find forgetfulness, remembering only
     Your face beside me in the scented gloom.I am not here for passion,
     I crave no love, only a little rest,
   Although I would my face lay, lover's fashion,
     Against the tender coolness of your breast.I am so weary of the Curse of Living
     The endless, aimless torture, tumult, fears.Surely, if life were any God's free giving,
     He, seeing His gift, long since went blind with tears.Seeing us; our fruitless strife, our futile praying,
     Our luckless Present and our bloodstained Past.Poor players, who make a trick or two in playing,
     But know that death _must_ win the game at last.As round the Fowler, red with feathered slaughter,
     The little joyous lark, unconscious, sings,--
   As the pink Lotus floats on azure water,
     Innocent of the mud from whence it springs.You walk through life, unheeding all the sorrow,
     The fear and pain set close around your way,
   Meeting with hopeful eyes each gay to-morrow,
     Living with joy each hour of glad to-day.I love to have you thus (nay, dear, lie quiet,
     How should these reverent fingers wrong your hair?)So calmly careless of the rush and riot
     That rages round is seething everywhere.You think your beauty
     Does but inflame my senses to desire,
   Till all you hold as loyalty and duty,
     Is shrunk and shrivelled in the ardent fire.You wrong me, wearied out with thought and grieving
     As though the whole world's sorrow eat my heart,
   I come to gaze upon your face believing
     Its beauty is as ointment to the smart.Lie still and let me in my desolation
     Caress the soft loose hair a moment's span.Since Loveliness is Life's one Consolation,
     And love the only Lethe left to man.Ah, give me here beneath the trees in flower,
     Beside the river where the fireflies pass,
   One little dusky, all consoling hour
     Lost in the shadow of the long grown grass

   Give me, oh you whose arms are soft and slender,
     Whose eyes are nothing but one long caress,
   Against your heart, so innocent and tender,
     A little Love and some Forgetfulness.Fate Knows no Tears

   Just as the dawn of Love was breaking
          Across the weary world of grey,
   Just as my life once more was waking
          As roses waken late in May,
   Fate, blindly cruel and havoc-making,
          Stepped in and carried you away.Memories have I none in keeping
          Of times I held you near my heart,
   Of dreams when we were near to weeping
          That dawn should bid us rise and part;
   Never, alas, I saw you sleeping
          With soft closed eyes and lips apart,

   Breathing my name still through your dreaming.--
          Ah!But Fate, unheeding human scheming,
          Serenely reckless came between--
   Fate with her cold eyes hard and gleaming
          Unseared by all the sorrow seen.well-beloved, I never told you,
          I did not show in speech or song,
   How at the end I longed to fold you
          Close in my arms; so fierce and strong
   The longing grew to have and hold you,
          You, and you only, all life long.They who know nothing call me fickle,
          Keen to pursue and loth to keep.Ah, could they see these tears that trickle
          From eyes erstwhile too proud to weep.Could see me, prone, beneath the sickle,
          While pain and sorrow stand and reap!Unopened scarce, yet overblown, lie
          The hopes that rose-like round me grew,
   The lights are low, and more than lonely
          This life I lead apart from you.I want you only,
          And you who loved me never knew.You loved me, pleaded for compassion
          On all the pain I would not share;
   And I in weary, halting fashion
          Was loth to listen, long to care;
   But now, dear God!I faint with passion
          For your far eyes and distant hair.Yes, I am faint with love, and broken
          With sleepless nights and empty days;
   I want your soft words fiercely spoken,
          Your tender looks and wayward ways--
   Want that strange smile that gave me token
          Of many things that no man says.Cold was I, weary, slow to waken
          Till, startled by your ardent eyes,
   I felt the soul within me shaken
          And long-forgotten senses rise;
   But in that moment you were taken,
          And thus we lost our Paradise!Farewell, we may not now recover
          That golden "Then" misspent, passed by,
   We shall not meet as loved and lover
          Here, or hereafter, you and I.
   My time for loving you is over,
          Love has no future, but to die.And thus we part, with no believing
          In any chance of future years.We have no idle self-deceiving,
          No half-consoling hopes and fears;
   We know the Gods grant no retrieving
          A wasted chance.Verses: Faiz Ulla

   Just in the hush before dawn
   A little wistful wind is born.A little chilly errant breeze,
   That thrills the grasses, stirs the trees.And, as it wanders on its way,
   While yet the night is cool and dark,
   The first carol of the lark,--
   Its plaintive murmurs seem to say
   "I wait the sorrows of the day."Two Songs by Sitara, of Kashmir

   Beloved!your hair was golden
   As tender tints of sunrise,
   As corn beside the River
         In softly varying hues.I loved you for your slightness,
   Your melancholy sweetness,
   Your changeful eyes, that promised
         What your lips would still refuse.You came to me, and loved me,
   Were mine upon the River,
   The azure water saw us
         And the blue transparent sky;
   The Lotus flowers knew it,
   Our happiness together,
   While life was only River,
         Only love, and you and I.

   Love wakened on the River,
   To sounds of running water,
   With silver Stars for witness
         And reflected Stars for light;
   Awakened to existence,
   With ripples for first music
   And sunlight on the River
         For earliest sense of sight.Love grew upon the River
   Among the scented flowers,
   The open rosy flowers
         Of the Lotus buds in bloom--
   Love, brilliant as the Morning,
   More fervent than the Noon-day,
   And tender as the Twilight
         In its blue transparent gloom.Cold snow upon the mountains,
   The Lotus leaves turned yellow
         And the water very grey.Our kisses faint and falter,
   The clinging hands unfasten,
   The golden time is over
         And our passion dies away.To be forgotten,
           A ripple on the River,
           That flashes in the sunset,
           That flashed,--and died away.Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan

                            Throb, throb, throb,
   Far away in the blue transparent Night,
   On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,
   She hears the sound of her lover's nearing boat
               Afar, afloat
   On the river's loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;
      Hear the sound of the straining wood
          Like a broken sob
          Of a heart's distress,
      Loving misunderstood.She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,
   On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,
   Every cell of her brain is latent fire,
   Every fibre tense with restrained desire.And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,
          The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;
        "How to wait through the moments' space
        Till I see the light of my lover's face?"Throb, throb, throb,
   The sound dies down the stream
   Till it only clings at the senses' edge
   Like a half-remembered dream.Doubtless, he in the silence lies,
         His fair face turned to the tender skies,
         Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.While his boat caught in the thickset sedge
   And the waters round it gurgle and sob,
         Or floats set free on the river's tide,
                                  Oars laid aside.She is awake and knows no rest,
   Passion dies and is dispossessed
          Of his brief, despotic power.But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire
   Were the whole world pasture to its desire,
   And all of love, in a single hour,--
   A single wine cup, filled to the brim,
                              Given to slake its thirst.Some there are who are thus-wise cursed
         Times that follow fulfilled desire
         Are of all their hours the worst.They find no Respite and reach no Rest,
   Though passion fail and desire grow dim,
         No assuagement comes from the thing possessed
                      For possession feeds the fire."Oh, for the life of the bright hued things
          Whose marriage and death are one,
        A floating fusion on golden wings."But we who re-marry a thousand times,
          As the spirit or senses will,
        In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,
          We remain unsatisfied still."As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,
   With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,
   Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,
   And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on
   Till the light of another day, serene and wan,
                              Pierces the eastern skies.Palm Trees by the Sea

   Love, let me thank you for this!Now we have drifted apart,
   Wandered away from the sea,--
     For the fresh touch of your kiss,
   For the young warmth of your heart,
     For your youth given to me.Thanks: for the curls of your hair,
     Softer than silk to the hand,
   For the clear gaze of your eyes.For yourself: delicate, fair,
   Seen as you lay on the sand,
     Under the violet skies.Thanks: for the words that you said,--
     Secretly, tenderly sweet,
   All through the tropical day,
     Till, when the sunset was red,
   I, who lay still at your feet,
     Felt my life ebbing away,

   Weary and worn with desire,
     Only yourself could console.For that fierce fervour and fire
   Burnt through my lips to my soul
     From the white heat of your kiss!You were the essence of Spring,
     Wayward and bright as a flame:
   Though we have drifted apart,
     Still how the syllables sing
   Mixed in your musical name,
     Deep in the well of my heart!Once in the lingering light,
     Thrown from the west on the Sea,
   Laid you your garments aside,
     Slender and goldenly bright,
   Glimmered your beauty, set free,
     Bright as a pearl in the tide.Once, ere the thrill of the dawn
     Silvered the edge of the sea,
   I, who lay watching you rest,--
     Pale in the chill of the morn
   Found you still dreaming of me
     Stilled by love's fancies possessed.Fallen on sorrowful days,
     Love, let me thank you for this,
   You were so happy with me!Wrapped in Youth's roseate haze,
   Wanting no more than my kiss
     By the blue edge of the sea!Ah, for those nights on the sand
     Under the palms by the sea,
   For the strange dream of those days
     Spent in the passionate land,
   For your youth given to me,
     I am your debtor always!Song by Gulbaz

   "Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes
   No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?"Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,
   Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented."Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,
   What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?"But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,
   Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,
   Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,
   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song

   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,
     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins
     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
   I would have rather felt you round my throat,
     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian

   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,
   Faintly the lingering light touches the edge of the sea,
   Sadly the Music of Waves, drifts, faint as an Anthem's insistence,
   Heard in the aisles of a dream, over the sandhills, to me.Now that the Lights are reversed, and the Singing changed into sighing,
   Now that the wings of our fierce, fugitive passion are furled,
   Take I unto myself, all alone in the light that is dying,
   Much of the sorrow that lies hid at the Heart of the World.Sad am I, sad for your loss: for failing the charm of your presence,
   Even the sunshine has paled, leaving the Zenith less blue.Even the ocean lessens the light of its green opalescence,
   Since, to my sorrow I loved, loved and grew weary of, you.Why was our passion so fleeting, why had the flush of your beauty
   Only so slender a spell, only so futile a power?Yet, even thus ever is life, save when long custom or duty
   Moulds into sober fruit Love's fragile and fugitive flower.Fain would my soul have been faithful; never an alien pleasure
   Lured me away from the light lit in your luminous eyes,
   But we have altered the World as pitiful man has leisure
   To criticise, balance, take counsel, assuredly lies.All through the centuries Man has gathered his flower, and fenced it,
   --Infinite strife to attain; infinite struggle to keep,--
   Holding his treasure awhile, all Fate and all forces against it,
   Knowing it his no more, if ever his vigilance sleep.But we have altered the World as pitiful man has grown stronger,
   So that the things we love are as easily kept as won,
   Therefore the ancient fight can engage and detain us no longer,
   And all too swiftly, alas, passion is over and done.Far too speedily now we can gather the coveted treasure,
   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;
   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,
   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour
   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,
   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,
   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,
   Even as Love's own fervour has faded away from me,
   Leaving the weariness, the monotonous Weight of Existence,--
   All the farewells in the world weep in the sound of the sea.Sunstroke

   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,
            Across green fields, the blue green sea,
   You knew the little weary feet
            Of my child bride that was to be!Her people brought her from the shore
            One golden day in sultry June,
   And I stood, waiting, at the door,
            Praying my eyes might see her soon.With eager arms, wide open thrown,
            Now never to be satisfied!Ere I could make my love my own
            She closed her amber eyes and died.they took no heed
            How frail she was, my little one,
   But brought her here with cruel speed
            Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.We laid her on the marriage bed
            The bridal flowers in her hand,
   A maiden from the ocean led
            Only, alas!I walk alone; the air is sweet,
            The white road wanders to the sea,
   I dream of those two little feet
            That grew so tired in reaching me.Adoration

   Who does not feel desire unending
     To solace through his daily strife,
   With some mysterious Mental Blending,
     The hungry loneliness of life?Until, by sudden passion shaken,
     As terriers shake a rat at play,
   He finds, all blindly, he has taken
     The old, Hereditary way.Yet, in the moment of communion,
     The very heart of passion's fire,
   His spirit spurns the mortal union,
     "Not this, not this, the Soul's desire!"*        *        *        *

   Oh You, by whom my life is riven,
     And reft away from my control,
   Take back the hours of passion given!Although I once, in ardent fashion,
     Implored you long to give me this;
   (In hopes to stem, or stifle, passion)
     Your hair to touch, your lips to kiss

   Now that your gracious self has granted
     The loveliness you hold as naught,
   I find, alas!not that I wanted--
     Possession has not stifled Thought.Desire its aim has only shifted,--
     Built hopes upon another plan,
   And I in love for you have drifted
     Beyond all passion known to man.Beyond all dreams of soft caresses
     The solacing of any kiss,--
   Beyond the fragrance of your tresses
     (Once I had sold my soul for this!)But now I crave no mortal union
     (Thanks for that sweetness in the past);
   I need some subtle, strange communion,
     Some sense that _I_ join _you_, at last.Long past the pulse and pain of passion,
     Long left the limits of all love,--
   I crave some nearer, fuller fashion,
     Some unknown way, beyond, above,--

   Some infinitely inner fusion,
     As Wave with Water; Flame with Fire,--
   Let me dream once the dear delusion
     That I am You, Oh, Heart's Desire!Your kindness lent to my caresses
     That beauty you so lightly prize,--
   The midnight of your sable tresses,
     The twilight of your shadowed eyes.Ah, for that gift all thanks are given!Yet, Oh, adored, beyond control,
   Count all the passionate past forgiven
     And love me once, once, from your soul.Three Songs of Zahir-u-Din

   The tropic day's redundant charms
     Cool twilight soothes away,
   The sun slips down behind the palms
     And leaves the landscape grey.I want to take you in my arms
           And kiss your lips away!I wake with sunshine in my eyes
     And find the morning blue,
   A night of dreams behind me lies
     And all were dreams of you!Ah, how I wish the while I rise,
           That what I dream were true.The weary day's laborious pace,
     I hasten and beguile
   By fancies, which I backwards trace
     To things I loved erstwhile;
           The weary sweetness of your face,
           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your hair
     Where faint bronze shadows are,
   Your strangely slight and youthful air,
     No passions seem to mar,--
           Oh, why, since Fate has made you fair,
           Must Fortune keep you far?Thus spent, the day so long and bright
     Less hot and brilliant seems,
   Till in a final flare of light
     The sun withdraws his beams.Then, in the coolness of the night,
           I meet you in my dreams!Second Song

   How much I loved that way you had
   Of smiling most, when very sad,
   A smile which carried tender hints
       Of delicate tints
       And warbling birds,
       Of sun and spring,
   And yet, more than all other thing,
   Of Weariness beyond all Words!None other ever smiled that way,
       None that I know,--
   The essence of all Gaiety lay,
   Of all mad mirth that men may know,
   In that sad smile, serene and slow,
   That on your lips was wont to play.It needed many delicate lines
   And subtle curves and roseate tints
   To make that weary radiant smile;
   It flickered, as beneath the vines
   The sunshine through green shadow glints
   On the pale path that lies below,
   Flickered and flashed, and died away,
   But the strange thoughts it woke meanwhile
       Were wont to stay.Thoughts of Strange Things you used to know
   In dim, dead lives, lived long ago,
   Some madly mirthful Merriment
   Whose lingering light is yet unspent,--
   Some unimaginable Woe,--
   Your strange, sad smile forgets these not,
   Though you, yourself, long since, forgot!Third Song, written during Fever

   To-night the clouds hang very low,
       They take the Hill-tops to their breast,
       And lay their arms about the fields.The wind that fans me lying low,
       Restless with great desire for rest,
       No cooling touch of freshness yields.I, sleepless through the stifling heat,
       Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow
       Between the wide set open doors.I lie and long amidst the heat,--
       The fever that my senses know,
       For that cool slenderness of yours.A roseleaf that has lain in snow,
       A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.You do not know, so young you are,
       How Fever fans the senses' glow
       To uncontrollable desire!And fills the spaces of the night
       With furious and frantic thought,
       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night
       These visions would be turned to naught,
       These hateful dreams be held at bay!But you are far, and Loneliness
       My only lover through the night;
       And not for any word or prayer
   Would you console my loneliness
       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,
       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,
       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn
       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you
       As dying men in deserts turn
       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,
       Unceasing and unsatisfied,
       Until the night is burnt away
   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,
       And, through the open doorways, glide
       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks

   This man has taken my Husband's life
     And laid my Brethren low,
   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,
     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim
     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him
     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone
     And the slender wrists are bound,
   So young!and yet he has overthrown
     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,
     To whom it were right and meet
   To wash the stains of the War away,
     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls
     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,
     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone
     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,
     Unknown!how I wish you lay,
   Alone in my silken tent to-night
     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,
     I would bathe your wounds with wine,
   And setting your feet against my head
     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,
     The Jewels weigh on my breast,
   All I would leave, with delight, to share
     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,
     Lips murmur below their breath,
   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,
     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din

   Alas!this wasted Night
   With all its Jasmin-scented air,
   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!I lie alone, and long for you,
   Long for your Champa-scented hair,
   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;

   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips
   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--
   Here, where the slender fountain drips,
   Here, where the yellow roses glow,
   Pale in the tender silver shine
   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--
   Despite their praiseful litany,
   His season is not all delights
   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--
   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,
   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,
   The baffled senses almost deem
   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,
   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;
   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet
   Of sweeter singers went his way;
   Inhale warm breezes from the South,
   Yet never fed his fancy stray.From some near Village I can hear
   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,
   Now softly distant, now more near;
   And in an almost human fashion,
   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come
   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,

   To mock me, lying here alone
   Among the thousand useless flowers
   Upon the fountain's border-stone--
   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie
   Counting the slowly passing hours
   By the white spangles in the sky.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,
   Where, close together, side by side,
   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state
   With lips serene and downcast eyes,
   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,
   While round them songs and laughter rise.They are together; Why are we
   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze
   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers
   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;
   A little gurgle of the spray
   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,
   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone
   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree
   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst
   For all to me this night denied
   And drunk with longing, and accurst
   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,
   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,
   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,
   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,
   Sad for my empty arms, so hot
   And fevered, even the chilly stone
   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--
   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,
   You bring me not my Life's Delight,
   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,
   Pass on, most false and futile night,
   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song

   Death and Famine on every side
       And never a sign of rain,
   The bones of those who have starved and died
       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,
   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,
       And the brave red blood set free,
   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--
       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright
       And your blood is red like wine,
   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,
       Like softly pattering rain,
   I see the fever, folly, and fears
       Fulfilling man's tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,
       I revel beneath its shine,
   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,
       That I do not stop to think
   For all the pleasure this Life may hold
       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul's delight,
       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night
       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send
       I may carry quietly through,
   And pray for grace when I reach the end,
       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,
       Without a sorrowful sign,
   Because I sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,
       To bury what dead we may,
   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done
       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight
       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour

   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand
     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,
   Tired of the green caresses of the land,
     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn
     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,
   While little winds blow here and there forlorn
     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,
     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,
   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;
     And looking out across the window sill

   See, from the upper window's vantage ground,
     Mankind slip into harness once again,
   And wearily resume his daily round
     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:
     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,
     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat
     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--
   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,
     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,
     The only immortality we know,--
   Even if from the flower of our embrace
     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,

   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,
     That we should cause another You or Me,--
   Another life, from our light passion lit,
     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs
     In a closed circle.All we know or see
   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,
     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,
     And the past night of passion worse than waste,
   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,
     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn
     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn
     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border

   The tremulous morning is breaking
     Against the white waste of the sky,
   And hundreds of birds are awaking
     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,
     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,
   The sound of that iron desolation,
     The train that will bear me from you.'T will carry me under your casement,
     You'll feel in your dreams as you lie
   The quiver, from gable to basement,
     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--
     Your dear, unforgettable door,
   'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it
     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,
     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,
   I'll look at the tinsel-edged curtain
     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty
     Alone in the chill and the gloom,
   My eyes are still full of the beauty
     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses
     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses
     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated
     You're now and for ever set free,
   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,
     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won't find a trace, when you waken,
     Of me or my love of the past,
   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken
     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence
     You never need suffer again,
   Nor even perceive in the distance
     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din

   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate
                        The Night slips quietly through,
   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,
                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble
                        Light over lovers thrown,--
   Her hush and mystery know no history
                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,
   But things that are done by Night remain
                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, 'neath a thousand skies,
                        Night has brought men love;
   Therefore the old, old longings rise
                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,
                        And the mists weird and white,
   While Time is scented with musk and rose;
                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,
                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,
   Softly, as lovers have always come
                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song

   Against the planks of the cabin side,
       (So slight a thing between them and me,)
   The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
       The great green waves of the Indian sea!Your face was white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
   I would we had steamed and reached that night
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world.The wind blew in through the open port,
       So freshly joyous and salt and free,
   Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,
       And then swept back to the open sea.The engines throbbed with their constant beat;
       Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;
   Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,
       While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.So straight you lay in your narrow berth,
       Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be
   Essence of all that is sweet on earth,
       Of all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world!'T is eight miles out and eight miles in,
        Just at the break of morn.'T is ice without and flame within,
        To gain a kiss at dawn!Far, where the Lilac Hills arise
        Soft from the misty plain,
   A lone enchanted hollow lies
        Where I at last drew rein.Midwinter grips this lonely land,
        This stony, treeless waste,
   Where East, due East, across the sand,
        We fly in fevered haste.the East will soon be red,
        The wild duck westward fly,
   And make above my anxious head,
        Triangles in the sky.Like wind we go; we both are still
        So young; all thanks to Fate!(It cuts like knives, this air so chill,)
        Dear God!Behind us, wrapped in mist and sleep
        The Ruined City lies,
   (Although we race, we seem to creep!)Eight miles out only, eight miles in,
        Good going all the way;
   But more and more the clouds begin
        To redden into day.And every snow-tipped peak grows pink
        An iridescent gem!My heart beats quick, with joy, to think
        How I am nearing them!As mile on mile behind us falls,
        Till, Oh, delight!I see
   My Heart's Desire, who softly calls
        Across the gloom to me.The utter joy of that First Love
        No later love has given,
   When, while the skies grew light above,
        We entered into Heaven.Till I Wake

   When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly,
     Stoop, as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South.So I may, when I wake, if there be an Awakening,
     Keep, what lulled me to sleep, the touch of your lips on my mouth.His Rubies: Told by Valgovind

   Along the hot and endless road,
     Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,
   The prisoner bore his fetters' load
     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,
     Without a hope, without a friend,
   He, under escort, onward went,
     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay
     On either side, and in the heat
   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day
     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell
     And tender colours touched the sky,
   He still felt youth within him dwell
     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit
     And casting fitful light around,
   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit
     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,
     Were resting, when a group of girls
   Across the small encampment passed,
     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes
     A sudden light lit up once more,
   The women saw him with surprise,
     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime
     If young and fair the criminal be
   Here in this tropic, amorous clime
     Where love is still untamed and free.And one there was, she walked less fast,
     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled
   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,
     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,
     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,
     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom
     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)
   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,
     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,
     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:
     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine
     Would live his life, and see the sun
   Across these fields of poppies shine,
     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,
     Leaving a little life behind,
   You, were you kind to me to-night,
     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you
     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,
     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,
     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.From behind the Rover expedition a cry arose,
telling that more of the natives were coming from that direction."We are being hemmed in," said Dick Chester nervously."No, let us make a stand," came from Rand."I think a concerted
volley from our pistols and guns will check their movements."It was decided to await the closer approach of the Bumwos, and
each of the party improved the next minute in seeing to it that
his weapon was ready for use.Suddenly a blood-curdling yell arose on the sultry air, and the
Bumwos were seen to be approaching from two directions, at right
angles to each other.cried Dick Rover, and began to fire at one
of the approaching forces.The fight that followed was, however, short and full of
consternation to the Africans.One of the parties was led by King
Susko himself, and the chief had covered less than half the
distance to where the Americans stood when a bullet from Tom
Rover's pistol reached him, wounding him in the thigh and causing
him to pitch headlong on the grass.The fall of the leader made the Africans set up a howl of dismay,
and instead of keeping up the fight they gathered around their
leader.Then, as the Americans continued to fire, they picked
King Susko up and ran off with him.A few spears were hurled at
our friends, but the whole battle, to use Sam's way of summing up
afterward, was a regular "two-for-a-cent affair."Soon the Bumwos
were out of sight down the mountain side.The first work of our friends after they had made certain that the
Africans had really retreated, was to attend to Tom's wound and
the bruise Randolph Rover had received from the stone.Fortunately
neither man nor boy was seriously hurt, although Tom carries the
mark of the spear's thrust to this day."But I don't care," said Tom."I hit old King Susko, and that was
worth a good deal, for it stopped the battle.If the fight had
kept on there is no telling how many of us might have been
killed."While the party was deliberating about what to do next, Cujo
reappeared."I go deep into de cabe when foah Bumwos come on me from behind,"
he explained."Da fight an' fight an' knock me down an' tie me wid vines, an'
den run away.But I broke loose from de vines an' cum just as
quick as could run.Werry big cabe dat, an' strange waterfall in
de back.""Let us explore the cave," said Dick."Somebody can remain on
guard outside."Some demurred to this, but the Rover boys could, not be held back,
and on they went, with Aleck with them.Soon Randolph Rover
hobbled after them, leaving Cujo and the college students to
remain on the watch.The cave proved to be a large affair, running all of half a mile
under the mountain.There were numerous holes in the roof,
through which the sun shone down, making the use of torches
unnecessary.To one side was a deep and swiftly flowing stream,
coming from the waterfall Cujo had mentioned, and disappearing
under the rocks near the entrance to the cavern.shouted Dick, as he gazed on the walls of the
cave."You are, Dick; this is a regular cave of gold, and no mistake.No wonder King Susko wanted to keep us away!"It was a fascinating scene to
watch the sparkling sheet as it thundered downward a distance of
fully a hundred feet.At the bottom was a pool where the water
was lashed into a milky foam which went swirling round and round.suddenly cried Sam, and pointed into
the falling water."Oh, Uncle Randolph, did you ever see anything
like it?""There are no such things as ghosts, Sam," replied his uncle."Stand here and look," answered Sam, and his uncle did as
requested.Presently from out of the mist came the form of a man--the
likeness of Randolph Rover himself!"It is nothing but an optical illusion, Sam, such as are produced
by some magicians on the theater stage.The sun comes down
through yonder hole and reflects your image on the wet rock, which
in turn reflects the form on the sheet of water."And that must be the ghost the natives believe in,"
answered Sam.I can tell you I was
startled.""Here is a path leading up past the waterfall," said Dick, who had
been making an investigation."Take care of where you go," warned Randolph Rover."There may be
some nasty pitfall there.""I'll keep my eyes open," responded Dick.He ascended the rocks, followed by Sam, while the others brought
up in the rear.Up over the waterfall was another cave, long and
narrow.There was now but little light from overhead, but far in
the distance could be seen a long, narrow opening, as if the
mountain top had been, by some convulsion of nature, split in
half."We are coming into the outer world again!"For beyond the opening was a small plain, covered with short grass
and surrounded on every side by jagged rocks which arose to the
height of fifty or sixty feet.In the center of the plain were a
number of native huts, of logs thatched with palm.CHAPTER XXX

FINDING THE LONG-LOST


"A village!""There are several women and children," returned Tom, pointing to
one of the huts."I guess the men went away to fight us."Let us investigate, but with
caution."As they advanced, the women and children set up a cry of alarm,
which was quickly taken up in several of the other huts."Go away, white men; don't touch us!"cried a voice in the purest
English.came from the three Rover boys, and they rushed off in
all haste toward the nut from which the welcome cry had proceeded.Anderson Rover was found in the center of the hut, bound fast by a
heavy iron chain to a post set deeply into the ground.His face
was haggard and thin and his beard was all of a foot and a half
long, while his hair fell thickly over his shoulders.He was
dressed in the merest rags, and had evidently suffered much from
starvation and from other cruel treatment."Do I see aright, or
is it only another of those wild dreams that have entered my brain
lately?"burst out Dick, and hugged his parent
around the neck."It's no dream, father; we are really here," put in Tom, as he
caught one of the slender hands, while Sam caught the other.And then he added tenderly: "But
we'll take good care of you, now we have found you."murmured Anderson Rover, as the brother came up.and the tears began to
flow down his cheeks.Many a time I
thought to give up in despair!""We came as soon as we got that message you sent," answered Dick."But that was long after you had sent it.""And is the sailor, Converse, safe?""Too bad--he was the one friend I had here.""And King Susko has kept you a prisoner all this while?""Yes; and he has treated me shamefully in the bargain.He
imagined I knew all of the secrets of this mountain, of a gold
mine of great riches, and he would not let me go; but, instead,
tried to wring the supposed secret from me by torture.""We will settle accounts with him some day," muttered Dick."It's
a pity Tom didn't kill him."The native women and children were looking in at the doorway
curiously, not knowing what to say or do.Turning swiftly, Dick
caught one by the arm."The key to the lock," he demanded, pointing to the lock on the
iron chain which bound Anderson Rover.But the woman shook her head, and pointed off in the distance."King Susko has the key," explained Anderson Rover."You will
have to break the chain,"  And this was at last done, although not
without great difficulty.In the meantime the natives were ordered to prepare a meal for
Anderson Rover and all of the others, and Cujo was called that he
might question the Africans in their own language.The meal was soon forthcoming, the Bumwo women fearing that they
would be slaughtered if they did not comply with the demands of
the whites.To make sure that the food had not been poisoned,
Dick made several of the natives eat portions of each dish."Um know a good deal," he remarked."Cujo was goin' to tell Dick to do dat.""I am glad the women and children are here," said Randolph Rover."We can take them with us when we leave and warn King Susko that
if he attacks us we will kill them.I think he will rather let us
go than see all of the women and children slaughtered."While they ate, Anderson Rover told his story, which is far too
long to insert here.He had found a gold mine further up the
country and also this mountain of gold, but had been unable to do
anything since King Susko had made him and the sailor prisoners.During his captivity he had suffered untold cruelties, but all
this was now forgotten in the joy of the reunion with his brother
and his three sons.It was decided that the party should leave the mountain without
delay, and Cujo told the female natives to get ready to move.At
this they set up a loud protest, but it availed them nothing, and
they soon quieted down when assured that no harm would befall them
if they behaved.CHAPTER XXXI

HOME AGAIN--CONCLUSION


Nightfall found the entire expedition, including the women and
children, on the mountain side below the caves.As the party went
down the mountain a strict watch was kept for the Bumwo warriors,
and just as the sun was setting, they were discovered in camp on
the trail to the northwest."We will send out a flag of truce," said Randolph Rover.This was done, and presently a tall Bumwo under chief came out in
a plain to hold a mujobo, or "law talk."In a few words Cujo explained the situation, stating that they now
held in bondage eighteen women and children, including King
Susko's favorite wife Afgona.If the whites were allowed to pass
through the country unharmed until they, reached the village of
Kwa, where the Kassai River joins the Congo, they would release
all of the women and children at that point and they could go back
to rejoin their husbands and fathers.If, on the other hand, the
expedition was attacked the whites would put all of those in
bondage to instant death.It is not likely that this horrible threat would have been put
into execution.As Dick said when relating the particulars of the
affair afterward."We couldn't have done such a terrible thing,
for it would not have been human."But the threat had the desired
effect, and in the morning King Susko, who was now on a sick bed,
sent word that they should go through unmolested.And go through they did, through jungles and over plains, across
rivers and lakes and treacherous swamps, watching continually for
their enemies, and bringing down many a savage beast that showed
itself.On the return they fell in with Mortimer Blaze, and he,
being a crack shot, added much to the strength of their command.At last Kwa was reached, and here they found themselves under the
protection of several European military organizations.The native
women and children were released, much to their joy, and my
readers can rest assured that these Africans lost no time in
getting back to that portion of the Dark Continent which they
called home.From Kwa to Boma the journey was comparatively easy.At Stanley
Pool they rested for a week, and all in the party felt the better
for it."Some day I will go back and open up the mines I have discovered,"
said Anderson Rover.I want to see my own dear
native land first."Josiah Crabtree had turned up and been
joined by Dan Baxter, and both had left for parts unknown."I hope we never see them again," said Dick, and his brothers said
the same.An American ship was in port, bound for Baltimore, and all of our
party, including the Yale students, succeeded in obtaining passage
on her for home.The trip was a most delightful one, and no days
could have been happier than those which the Rover boys spent
grouped around their lather listening to all he had to tell of the
numerous adventures which had befallen him since he had left home.A long letter was written to Captain Townsend, telling of the
finding of Anderson Rover, and the master of the Rosabel was,
later on, sent a gift of one hundred dollars for his goodness to
the Rovers.Of course Anderson Rover was greatly interested in what his sons
had been doing and was glad to learn that they were progressing so
finely at Putnam Hall."We will let Arnold Baxter drop," he said."He is our enemy, I know; but just now we will let the law take
its course for the rascality he practiced in Albany.""We can afford to let him
drop, seeing how well things have terminated for ourselves.""And how happy we are going to be," chimed in Sam."And how rich--when father settles up that mining claim in the
West," put in Tom.Here I must bring to a finish the story of the Rover boys'
adventures in the jungles of Africa.They had started out to find
their father, and they had found him, and for the time being all
went well.The home-coming of the Rovers was the occasion of a regular
celebration at Valley Brook farm.The neighbors came in from far
and wide and with them several people from the city who in former
years had known Anderson Rover well.It was a time never to be forgotten, and the celebration was kept
up for several days.Captain Putnam was there, and with him came
Frank, Fred, Larry, and several others.The captain apologized
handsomely to Aleck for the way he had treated the <DW52> man."I wish I had been with you," said Fred."You Rover boys are
wonders for getting around."I think we'll go West next," answered Dick."Father wants to
look up his mining interests, you know.We are going to ask him
to take us along."They did go west, and what adventures they had
will be related in a new volume, entitled "The Rover Boys Out West;
or, The Search for a Lost Mine.""But we are coming back to Putnam Hall first," added Tom.I thought of it even in the heart of Africa!""And so did I," put in Sam."I'll tell you, fellows, it's good
enough to roam around, but, after all, there is no place like
home."And with this truthful remark from the youngest Rover, let us
close this volume, kind reader, hoping that all of us may meet
again in the next book of the series, to be entitled, "The Rover
Boys Out West; or, The Search for a Lost Mine."In this story all
of our friends will once more play important parts, and we will
learn what the Baxters, father and son, did toward wresting the
Rover Boys' valuable mining property from them.But for the time
being all went well, and so good-by.Wainwright, Joseph, Corbar, Buxton, Derbyshire.Clark, A. H., Moulton Eaugate, Spalding, Lincs.Freshney, T.

the prizes at the Shire Horse Show have, to a great extent, fixed the
type to find favour at other important shows.Very often the same
judges have officiated at several important exhibitions during the
same season, which has tended towards uniformity in prize-winning
Shires.On looking down the list, it will be seen that four judges
were appointed till 1895, while the custom of the Society to get its
Council from as many counties as possible has not been followed in
the matter of judges’ selection.For instance, Warwickshire--a great
county for Shire breeding--has only provided two judges in twenty-six
years, and one of them--Mr.Potter--had recently come from Lockington
Grounds, Derby, where he bred the renowned Prince William.For many
years Hertfordshire has provided a string of winners, yet no judge has
hailed from that county, or from Surrey, which contains quite a number
of breeders of Shire horses.No fault whatever is being found with the
way the judging has been carried out.It is no light task, and nobody
but an expert could, or should, undertake it; but it is only fair to
point out that high-class Shires are, and have been, bred in Cornwall,
and Devonshire, Kent, and every other county, while the entries at the
show of 1914 included a stallion bred in the Isle of Man.In 1890, as elsewhere stated, the membership of the Society was 1615,
whereas the number of members given in the 1914 volume of the Stud Book
is 4200.The aim of each and all is “to improve the Old English breed
of Cart Horses,” many of which may now be truthfully described by their
old title of “War Horses.”




CHAPTER XIV

THE EXPORT TRADE


Among the first to recognize the enormous power and possibilities of
the Shire were the Americans.Very few London shows had been held
before they were looking out for fully-registered specimens to take
across the Atlantic.Towards the close of the ’eighties a great export
trade was done, the climax being reached in 1889, when the Shire Horse
Society granted 1264 export certificates.A society to safeguard the
interests of the breed was formed in America, these being the remarks
of Mr.A. Galbraith (President of the American Shire Horse Society) in
his introductory essay: “At no time in the history of the breed have
first-class animals been so valuable as now, the praiseworthy endeavour
to secure the best specimens of the breed having the natural effect of
enhancing prices all round.Breeders of Shire horses both in England
and America have a hopeful and brilliant future before them, and by
exercising good judgment in their selections, and giving due regard to
pedigree and soundness, as well as individual merit, they will not only
reap a rich pecuniary reward, but prove a blessing and a benefit to
this country.”

From the day that the Shire Horse Society was incorporated, on June
3, 1878, until now, America has been Britain’s best overseas customer
for Shire horses, a good second being our own colony, the Dominion of
Canada.Another stockbreeding country to make an early discovery of the
merits of “The Great Horse” was Argentina, to which destination many
good Shires have gone.In 1906 the number given in the Stud Book was
118.So much importance is attached to the breed both in the United
States and in the Argentine Republic that English judges have travelled
to each of those country’s shows to award the prizes in the Shire
Classes.Another great country with which a good and growing trade has been done
is Russia.In 1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had increased to
fifty-two, so there is evidently a market there which is certain to be
extended when peace has been restored and our powerful ally sets about
the stupendous, if peaceful, task of replenishing her horse stock.Our other allies have their own breeds of draught horses, therefore
they have not been customers for Shires, but with war raging in their
breeding grounds, the numbers must necessarily be reduced almost to
extinction, consequently the help of the Shire may be sought for
building up their breeds in days to come.German buyers have not fancied Shire horses to any extent--British-bred
re-mounts have been more in their line.In 1905, however, Germany was the destination of thirty-one.By 1910
the number had declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore, if
the export of trade in Shires to “The Fatherland” is altogether lost,
English breeders will scarcely feel it.Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are parts of the British
Empire to which Shires have been shipped for several years.Substantial
prizes in the shape of Cups and Medals are now given by the Shire
Horse Society to the best specimens of the breed exhibited at Foreign
and Colonial Shows.ENCOURAGING THE EXPORT OF SHIRES

The following is reprinted from the “Farmer and Stockbreeder Year Book”
for 1906, and was written by S. H. L.(J. A. Frost):--

    “The Old English breed of cart horse, or ‘Shire,’ is
    universally admitted to be the best and most valuable animal
    for draught purposes in the world, and a visitor from America,
    Mr.Morrow, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
    speaking at Mr.John Rowell’s sale of Shires in 1889, said,
    ‘Great as had been the business done in Shire horses in
    America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the more Shire
    horses became known, and the more they came into competition
    with other breeds, the more their merits for all heavy draught
    purposes were appreciated.’

    “These remarks are true to-day, for although sixteen years have
    elapsed since they were made (1906), the massive Shire has more
    than held his own, but in the interests of the breed, and of
    the nearly four thousand members of the Shire Horse Society,
    it is still doubtful whether the true worth of the Shire
    horse is properly known and appreciated in foreign countries
    and towns needing heavy horses, and whether the export trade
    in this essentially British breed is not capable of further
    development.The number of export certificates granted by the
    Shire Horse Society in 1889 was 1264, which takes a good deal
    of beating, but it must be remembered that since then Shire
    horse breeding at home has progressed by leaps and bounds,
    and tenant farmers, who could only look on in those days,
    are now members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society and
    owners of breeding studs, and such prices as 800 guineas for a
    two-year-old filly and 230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt,
    are less frequently obtainable than they were then; therefore,
    an increase in the demand from other countries would find more
    Shire breeders ready to supply it, although up to the present
    the home demand has been and is very good, and weighty geldings
    continue to be scarce and dear.”


THE NUMBER EXPORTED

“It may be true that the number of horses exported during the last year
or two has been higher than ever, but when the average value of those
that go to ‘other countries’ than Holland, Belgium, and France, is
worked out, it does not allow of such specimens as would excite the
admiration of a foreign merchant or Colonial farmer being exported,
except in very isolated instances; then the tendency of American buyers
is to give preference to stallions which are on the quality rather than
on the weighty side, and as the mares to which they are eventually put
are also light boned, the typical English dray horse is not produced.“During the past year (1905) foreign buyers have been giving very
high prices for Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the same
spirited manner at the Shire sales, a much more creditable animal
could be obtained for shipment.As an advertisement for the Shire
it is obviously beneficial that the Shire Horse Society--which is
unquestionably the most successful breed society in existence--gives
prizes for breeding stock and also geldings at a few of the most
important horse shows in the United States.This tends to bring the
breed into prominence abroad, and it is certain that many Colonial
farmers would rejoice at being able to breed working geldings of a
similar type to those which may be seen shunting trucks on any large
railway station in England, or walking smartly along in front of a
binder in harvest.The writer has a relative farming in the North-West
Territory of Canada, and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in
the stock line that there is much money in now is horses; they are
keeping high, and seem likely to for years, as so many new settlers are
coming in all the time, and others do not seem able to raise enough
for their own needs’; and it may be mentioned that almost the only
kind of stallions available there are of the Percheron breed, which
is certainly not calculated to improve the size, or substance, of the
native draught horse stock.THE COST OF SHIPPING

“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool to New York is about £11,
which is not prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as the Shire
horse, and if such specimens of the breed as the medal winners at shows
like Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught horse classes at
the best horse shows of America, it is more than probable that at least
some of the visitors would be impressed with their appearance, and an
increase in the export trade in Shires might thereby be brought about.“A few years ago the price of high-class Shire stallions ran upwards of
a thousand pounds, which placed them beyond the reach of exporters;
but the reign of what may be called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be
over, at least for a time, seeing that the general sale averages have
declined since that of Lord Llangattock in October, 1900, when the
record average of £226 1_s._ 8_d._ was made, although the best general
average for the sales of any single year was obtained in 1901, viz.£112 5_s._ 10_d._ for 633 animals, and it was during that year that the
highest price for Shires was obtained at an auction sale, the sum being
1550 guineas, given by Mr.Leopold Salomons, for the stallion Hendre
Champion, at the late Mr.Crisp’s sale at Girton.Other high-priced
stallions purchased by auction include Marmion II., 1400 guineas, and
Chancellor, 1100 guineas, both by Mr.Waresley Premier Duke,
1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases
of Mr.These figures show that the
worth of a really good Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and
it is certain that the market for this particular class of animal is
by no means glutted, but rather the reverse, as the number of males
offered at the stud sales is always limited, which proves that there
is ‘room on the top’ for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in
view and the possible chance of an increased foreign trade in stallions
it behoves British breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no
falling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’ to use the American
word, but rather that a continual improvement is aimed at, so that
visitors from horse-breeding countries may find what they want if they
come to ‘the stud farm of the world.’

“The need to keep to the right lines and breed from good old stock
which has produced real stock-getting stallions cannot be too strongly
emphasised, for the reason that there is a possibility of the British
market being overstocked with females, with a corresponding dearth of
males, both stallions and geldings, and although this is a matter which
breeders cannot control they can at least patronise a strain of blood
famous for its males.The group of Premier--Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,
Northwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich Topsman--may be quoted as
showing the advisability of continuing to use the same horse year after
year if colt foals are bred, and wanted, and the sire is a horse of
merit.“With the number of breeders of Shire horses and the plentiful supply
of mares, together with the facilities offered by local stallion-hiring
societies, it ought not to be impossible to breed enough high-grade
sires to meet the home demand and leave a surplus for export as well,
and the latter of the class that will speak for themselves in other
countries, and lead to enquiries for more of the same sort.FEW HIGH PRICES FROM EXPORTERS

“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the high prices obtained for
Shires at public sales have come from exporters or buyers from abroad,
but from lovers of the heavy breed in England, who have been either
forming or replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty dollar’ has not
been responsible for the figures above quoted.Still it is probable
that with the opening up of the agricultural industry in Western
Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere, Shire stallions will be needed to
help the Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses which will be
useful for both tillage and haulage purposes.“The adaptability of the Shire horse to climate and country is well
known, and it is satisfactory for home breeders to hear that Mr.Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten Shires, bred in Argentina, at an
average of £223 2_s._ 6_d._, one, a three-year-old, making £525.“Meanwhile it might be a good investment if a syndicate of British
breeders placed a group of typical Shire horses in a few of the biggest
fairs or shows in countries where weighty horses are wanted, and thus
further the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist in developing the
export trade.”

It may be added that during the summer of 1906, H.M.King Edward and
Lord Rothschild sent a consignment of Shires to the United States of
America for exhibition.CHAPTER XV

PROMINENT PRESENT-DAY STUDS


Seeing that Lord Rothschild has won the greatest number of challenge
cups and holds the record for having made the highest price, his name
is mentioned first among owners of famous studs.He joined the Shire Horse Society in February, 1891, and at the show
of 1892 made five entries for the London Show at which he purchased
the second prize three-year-old stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by
Lincolnshire Lad II.)He is
remembered by the writer as being a wide and weighty horse on short
legs which carried long hair in attendance, and this type has been
found at Tring Park ever since.In 1895 his lordship won first and
third with two chestnut fillies--Vulcan’s Flower by the Champion Vulcan
and Walkern Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).The former won the
Filly Cup and was subsequently sold to help to found the famous stud
of Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park, Surrey, the sum given being a
very high one for those days.The first championship was obtained with the mare Alston Rose in 1901,
which won like honours for Mr.R. W. Hudson in 1902, after costing him
750 guineas at the second sale at Tring Park, January 15, 1902.Solace, bred by King Edward, was the next champion mare from Lord
Rothschild’s stud.Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge Cup in
1905, was included in a select shipment of Shires sent to America (as
models of the breed) by our late lamented King and Lord Rothschild in
1906.Princess Beryl, Belle Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win
highest honours for the stud, while a young mare which passed through
Lord Rothschild’s hands, and realized a four-figure sum for him as
a two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts, Messrs.W. and H.
Whitley, is Lorna Doone, the Champion mare of 1914.Champion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker, has been mentioned,
so we can now refer to the successful stud of which he is the central
figure, viz.that owned by Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,
Woldingham, Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good filly from the
Tring Stud in 1895, the year in which he became a member of the Shire
Horse Society.At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in 1898, he purchased
Windley Lily for 430 guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old
filly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the best.At the
Tandridge dispersion sale he gave over a thousand pounds for the
Lockinge Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and her foal.Sir
Walpole was one of the first to profit by the Lockinge Forest King
blood, his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having been a winner at
the Royal of 1908, while her daughter, Marden Constance, has had a
brilliant show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased from Mr.T.
Ewart as a yearling, twice London Champion mare.No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments have been sold at
Peterborough, so that the prefix is frequently met with.The stud owner who is willing to give £4305 for a two-year-old colt
deserves success.THE PRIMLEY STUD

At the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907, Mr.W. Whitley purchased
Dunsmore Fuchsia (by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905 and 1906,
for 520 guineas, also Quality by the same sire, and these two won
second and third for him in London the same month, this being the first
show at which the Primley shires took honours.The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the Champion stallion of 1908, by
Messrs.W. and H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700 guineas
created quite a sensation, as it was an outstanding record, it stood so
for nearly four years.One of the most successful show mares in this--or any--stud is
Mollington Movement by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning queen is
Lorna Doone, the London and Peterborough Champion of 1914, purchased
privately from the Tring Park Stud.Another built on the same lines
is Sussex Pride with which a Bucks tenant farmer, Mr.R. H. Keene,
won first and reserve champion at the London Show of 1913, afterwards
selling her to Messrs.Whitley, who again won with her in 1914.With
such animals as these Devonshire is likely to hold its own with Shires,
although they do not come from the district known to the law makers of
old as the breeding ground of “the Great Horse.”


THE PENDLEY FEMALES

One of the most successful exhibitors of mares, fillies, and foals, at
the shows of the past few seasons has been Mr.J. G. Williams, Pendley
Manor, Tring.Like other exhibitors already mentioned, the one under
notice owes much of his success to Lockinge Forest King.In 1908 Lord
Egerton’s Tatton May Queen was purchased for 420 guineas, she having
been first in London as a yearling and two-year-old; Bardon Forest
Princess, a reserve London Champion, and Barnfields Forest Queen, Cup
winner there, made a splendid team of winners by the sire named.At the
Tring Park sale of 1913 Mr.Williams gave the highest price made by
a female, 825 guineas, for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch Forest
King.She won the Royal Championship at Bristol for him.One of the
later acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King, Cup winner and
reserve Champion in London, 1914, as a three-year-old, first at the
Royal, and reserve Champion at Peterborough.Williams joined the
Shire Horse Society in 1906, since when he has won all but the London
Championship with his mares and fillies.A NEW STUD

After Champion’s Goalkeeper was knocked down Mr.Beck announced that
the disappointed bidder was Mr.C. R. H. Gresson, acting for the
Edgcote Shorthorn Company, Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission
to the Shire Horse Society being during that same month, February,
1913.Having failed to get the popular colt, his stable companion and
half brother, Stockman III., was purchased for 540 guineas, and shown
in London just after, where he won fourth prize.From this single entry
in 1913 the foundation of the stud was so rapid that seven entries
were made at the 1914 London Show.Fine Feathers was the first prize
yearling filly, Blackthorn Betty the second prize two-year-old filly,
the own bred Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling colt.After the show Lord Rothschild’s first prize two-year colt, Orfold
Blue Blood, was bought, together with Normandy Jessie, the third prize
yearling colt; so with these two, Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill
Forest Queen, and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn Co.,
Ltd., took a leading place at the shows of 1914.In future Edgcote
promises to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto been for its
Shorthorns.DUCAL STUDS

A very successful exhibitor of the past season has been his Grace
the Duke of Westminster, who owns a very good young sire in Eaton
Nunsuch--so good that he has been hired by the Peterborough Society.Shires have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for many years, and the
stud contains many promising animals now.Mention must be made of the great interest taken in Shires by the Duke
of Devonshire who, as the Hon.Victor Cavendish, kept a first-class
stud at Holker, Lancs.At the Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker
Mars was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton Draughtsman winning the
Norwich Royal Championship, and also that of the London Show of 1912
for his popular owner.OTHER STUDS

Among those who have done much to promote the breeding of the Old
English type of cart-horse, the name of Mr.Clement Keevil deserves
a foremost place.At Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number of
stud sales in the eighties and nineties, to which buyers went for
massive-limbed Shires of the good old strains; those with a pedigree
which traced back to Honest Tom (_alias_ Little David), foaled in the
year 1769, to Wiseman’s Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson a sire
weighing 1 ton 8 cwt.Later he had a stud at Billington, Beds, where
several sales were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr.Everard gave
860 guineas for the stallion, Lockinge Blagdon.Shortly before that he
sold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.The prefix “Birdsall” has been seen in show catalogues for a number of
years, which mean that the animals holding it were bred, or owned, by
Lord Middleton, at Birdsall, York, he being one of the first noblemen
to found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential Chair of the
Shire Horse Society.As long ago as the 1892 London Show there were two
entries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton’s own sire, Northwood, to which
reference is made elsewhere.Another notable sire purchased by his lordship was Menestrel, first in
London, 1900 (by Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being Birdsall
Menestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild
as a yearling.As a two-year-old this colt was Cup winner and reserve
Champion, and at four he was Challenge Cup winner.A good bidder at
Shire sales, the breeder of a champion, and a consistent supporter of
the Shire breeding industry since 1883, it is regrettable that champion
honours have not fallen to Lord Middleton himself.Another stud, which was founded near Leeds, by Mr.A. Grandage, has
now been removed to Cheshire.Joining the Shire Horse Society in 1892,
his first entry in London was made in 1893, and four years later, in
1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won the mare Championship for Mr.In 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion, Gaer Conqueror, of
Lincolnshire Lad descent, was bought from Mr.Edward Green for 825
guineas, which proved to be a real good investment for Mr.Grandage,
seeing that he won the championship of the Shire Horse Show for the two
following years, 1910 and 1911.Candidates from the Bramhope Stud, Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are
likely to give a very good account of themselves in the days to come.Among those who will have the best Shires is Sir Arthur Nicholson,
Highfield, Leek, Staffs.His first London success was third prize with
Rokeby Friar (by Harold) as a two-year-old in 1893, since which date he
has taken a keen personal interest in the breeding of Shire horses, and
has the honour of having purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced
mare yet sold by auction.At the Tring sale of 1913 he gave the second
highest price of that day, viz., 1750 guineas for the three-year-old
stallion, Blacklands Kingmaker, who won first prize for him in London
ten days after, but, alas, was taken ill during his season, for the
Winslow Shire Horse Society, and died.Another bad loss to Sir Arthur
and to Shire breeders generally was the death of Redlynch Forest King,
seeing that he promised to rival his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest
King, for begetting show animals.Among the many good ones recently exhibited from the stud may be
mentioned Leek Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek Challenger,
first as a yearling, second as a two-year-old, both of these being by
Redlynch Forest King.With such as these coming on there is a future
before the Shires of Sir Arthur Nicholson.The name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire breeders owing to the fame
achieved by the late Sir P. Albert Muntz.F. E. Muntz,
of Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire, a nephew of the Dunsmore
Baronet, joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since been President.Quite a good share of prizes have fallen to him, including the Cup for
the best old stallion in London both in 1913 and 1914.The winner,
Danesfield Stonewall, was reserved for the absolute championship on
both occasions, and this typical “Old English Black” had a host of
admirers, while Jones--the Umberslade stud groom--will never forget his
parade before His Majesty King George at the 1913 show.It used to be said that Shires did not flourish south of London, but
Mr.Leopold Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped to prove
otherwise.Beginning with one entry at the 1899 Show, he has entered
quite a string for several years, and the stud contains a number of
high-class stallions, notably Norbury Menestrel, winner of many prizes,
and a particularly well-bred and promising sire, and King of Tandridge
(by Lockinge Forest King), purchased by Mr.Salomons at the Tandridge
dispersion sale for 1600 guineas.At the sale during the London Show of
1914 Mr.Salomons realized the highest price with his own bred Norbury
Coronation, by Norbury Menestrel, who, after winning third prize in his
class, cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas, Norbury George,
by the same sire, winning fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both
being three years old.This is the kind of advertisement for a stud,
no matter where its situation.Another Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who
has been a member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903.He purchased
Danesfield Stonewall from Mr.R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes
before re-selling him to Mr.His stud horses now includes
Marathon II., champion at the Oxford County Show of 1910.Mares and
fillies have also been successfully shown at the Royal Counties, and
other meetings in the south of England from the Fan Court establishment.A fine lot of Shires have been got together, at Tarnacre House,
Garstang, and the first prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,
King’s Choice, was bred by Messrs.J. E. and A. W. Potter, who also won
first with Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr.John Ferneyhough
took first prize as a three-year-old.With stallions of his type and
mares as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion’s Choice (by Childwick
Champion), Shires full of character should be forthcoming from these
Lancashire breeders.The Carlton Stud continues to flourish, although its founder, the late
Mr.James Forshaw, departed this life in 1908.His business abilities
and keen judgment have been inherited by his sons, one of whom judged
in London last year (1914), as his father did in 1900.This being a
record in Shire Horse history for father and son to judge at the great
Show of the breed.Carlton has always been famous for its stallions.It has furnished
London winners from the first, including the Champions Stroxton Tom
(1902 and 1903), Present King II.(1906), and Stolen Duchess, the
Challenge Cup winning mare of 1907.Forshaw and his sons are too numerous
to mention in detail.Another very
impressive stallion was What’s Wanted, the sire of Mr.A. C. Duncombe’s
Premier (also mentioned in another chapter), and a large family of
celebrated sons.His great grandsire was (Dack’s) Matchless 1509, a
great sire in the Fen country, which travelled through Moulton Eaugate
for thirteen consecutive seasons.Forshaw’s opinion
of him is given on another page.One of the most successful Carlton
sires of recent years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son, Tatton Dray
King, won highest honours in London, and realized 3700 guineas when
sold.Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions from this stud
through several decades of last century, and that a large number have
been travelled each season since, while a very large export trade has
been done by Messrs.Forshaw and Sons, it need hardly be said that the
influence of this stud has been world-wide.It is impossible to mention all the existing studs in a little book
like this, but three others will be now mentioned for the reason that
they are carried on by those who formerly managed successful studs,
therefore they have “kept the ball rolling,” viz.Thomas
Ewart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on his own behalf when the stud
of the late Sir P. A. Muntz--which he had managed for so long--was
dispersed, and has since brought out many winners, the most famous of
which is Dunsmore Chessie.R. H. Keene, under whose care the Shires
of Mr.R. W. Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse Society) at
Danesfield attained to such prominence, although not actually taking
over the prefix, took a large portion of the land, and carries on Shire
breeding quite successfully on his own account.The other of this class to be named is Mr.C. E. McKenna, who took over
the Bardon stud from Mr.B. N. Everard when the latter decided to let
the Leicestershire stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent his last
and worthiest years.Such enterprise gives farmers and men of moderate
means faith in the great and growing industry of Shire Horse breeding.Of stud owners who have climbed to prominence, although neither
landowners, merchant princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be
mentioned Mr.James Gould, Crouchley Lymm, Cheshire, whose Snowdon
Menestrel was first in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup at
the 1914 London Show; Messrs.E. and J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth,
who won seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in 1910, afterwards
selling him to the Duke of Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree
with him two years later.Henry Mackereth, the new London judge of 1915, entered the
exhibitors’ list at the London Show of 1899.Perhaps his most notable
horse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with which Lord Rothschild won fourth
prize in 1907, he being the sire of Messrs.Potter’s King’s Choice
above mentioned.Many other studs well meriting notice could be dealt with did time and
space permit, including that of a tenant farmer who named one of his
best colts “Sign of Riches,” which must be regarded as an advertisement
for the breed from a farmer’s point of view.Of past studs only one will be mentioned, that of the late Sir Walter
Gilbey, the dispersal having taken place on January 13, 1915.The first
Shire sale at Elsenham was held in 1885--thirty years ago--when the
late Lord Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas, for Glow, by
Spark, the average of £172 4_s._ 6_d._ being unbeaten till the Scawby
sale of 1891 (which was £198 17_s._ 3_d._).Sir Walter has been mentioned as one of the founders of the Shire Horse
Society; his services in aid of horse breeding were recognized by
presenting him with his portrait in oils, the subscribers numbering
1250.The presentation was made by King Edward (then Prince of Wales)
at the London Show of 1891.CHAPTER XVI

THE FUTURE OUTLOOK


This book is written when war, and all that pertains to it, is the
absorbing topic.In fact, no other will be listened to.What is
the good of talking about such a peaceful occupation as that of
agriculture while the nation is fighting for its very existence?To a
certain extent this can be understood, but stock breeding, and more
particularly horse breeding, cannot be suspended for two or three
seasons and then resumed without causing a gap in the supply of horses
coming along for future use.The cry of the army authorities is for “more and more men,” together
with a demand for a constant supply of horses of many types, including
the weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply is used up, with no
provision being made for a quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the
guns or baggage waggons in the days to come, the British Army, and
most others, will be faced with a problem not easily solved.The motor-mad mechanic may think that his chance has come, but generals
who have to lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered
mountains, will demand horses, hitherto--and henceforth--indispensable
for mounting soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into position, or
drawing their food supplies and munitions of war after them.When the mechanic has provided horseless vehicles to do all this,
horse breeding can be ignored by fighting men--not before.But horses,
particularly draft horses, are needed for commercial use.So far, coal
merchants are horse users, while brewers, millers, and other lorry
users have not altogether discarded the horse-drawn vehicle.For taking loads to and from the landing stage at Liverpool heavy
horses will be in great demand after the war--perhaps greater than they
have ever been.The railways will continue to exist, and, while they
do, powerful Shire geldings must be employed; no other can put the
necessary weight into the collar for shunting loaded trucks.During the autumn of 1914 no other kind of advice--although they got
plenty of it--was so freely and so frequently given to farmers as this,
“grow more wheat.”

If this has been acted upon, and there is no doubt that it has, at
least to some extent, it follows, as sure as the night follows the day,
that more horses will be required by those who grow the wheat.The land
has to be ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut, carted home
and delivered to mill, or railway truck, all meaning horse labour.It may happen that large farmers will use motor ploughs or steam
waggons, but these are beyond the reach of the average English farmer.Moreover, when bought they depreciate in value, whether working or
standing idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding or brood mare
does not do.If properly cared for and used they appreciate in value
from the time they are put to work until they are six or seven years
old, and by that age most farmers have sold their non-breeders to make
room for younger animals.Horse power is therefore the cheapest and
most satisfactory power for most farmers to use in front of field
implements and farm waggons, a fact which is bound to tell in favour of
the Shire in the coming times of peace which we anticipate.When awarding prizes for the best managed farm, the judges appointed by
the Royal Agricultural Society of England are instructed to consider--

“General Management with a view to profit,” so that any breed of live
stock which leaves a profit would help a competitor.Only a short time ago a Warwickshire tenant farmer told his landlord
that Shire horses had enabled himself and many others to attend the
rent audit, “with a smile on his face and the rent in his pocket.”

Most landlords are prepared to welcome a tenant in that state,
therefore they should continue to encourage the industry as they have
done during the past twenty-five years.Wars come to an end--the “Thirty Years’ War” did--so let us remember
the Divine promise to Noah after the flood, “While the earth remaineth
seedtime and harvest … shall not cease,” Gen.As long as there is
sowing and reaping to be done horses--Shire horses--will be wanted.“Far back in the ages
      The plough with wreaths was crowned;
    The hands of kings and sages
      Entwined the chaplet round;
    Till men of spoil disdained the toil
      By which the world was nourished,
    And dews of blood enriched the soil
      Where green their laurels flourished:
    Now the world her fault repairs--
      The guilt that stains her story;
    And weeps; her crimes amid the cares
      That formed her earliest glory.The glory, earned in deadly fray,
      Shall fade, decay and perish.Honour waits, o’er all the Earth
      Through endless generations,
    The art that calls her harvests forth
      And feeds the expectant nations.”

VINTON & COMPANY, LTD., 8, BREAM’S BUILDINGS, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON, E.C.Now, she looked better than ever; and she always sang at her work,
just as she used to do.Then one Sunday afternoon, the father and son went out to see how
things were getting on in the fields.Arne ran about, shooting with a
bow and arrows, which the father had himself made for him.Thus, they
went on straight towards the road which led past the church, and down
to the place which was called the broad valley.When they came there,
Nils sat down on a stone and fell into a reverie, while Arne went on
shooting, and running for his arrows along the road in the direction
of the church."Only not too far away," Nils said.Just as Arne was
at the height of his play, he stopped, listening, and called out,
"Father, I hear music."Nils, too, listened; and they heard the sound
of violins, sometimes drowned by loud, wild shouts, while above all
rose the rattling of wheels, and the trampling of horses' hoofs: it
was a bridal train coming home from the church."Come here, lad," the
father said, in a tone which made Arne feel he must come quickly.The
father had risen hastily, and now stood hidden behind a large tree.Arne followed till the father called out, "Not here, but go yonder!"Then the boy ran behind an elm-copse.The train of carriages had
already turned the corner of the birch-wood; the horses, white with
foam, galloping at a furious rate, while drunken people shouted and
hallooed.The father and Arne counted the carriages one after
another: there were fourteen.In the first, two fiddlers were
sitting; and the wedding tune sounded merrily through the clear air:
a lad stood behind driving.In the next carriage sat the bride, with
her crown and ornaments glittering in the sunshine.She was tall, and
when she smiled her mouth drew a little to one side; with her sat a
mild-looking man, dressed in blue.Then came the rest of the
carriages, the men sitting on the women's laps, and little boys
behind; drunken men riding six together in a one-horse carriage;
while in the last sat the purveyor of the feast, with a cask of
brandy in his arms.They drove rapidly past Nils and Arne, shouting
and singing down the hill; while behind them the breeze bore upwards,
through a cloud of dust, the sound of the violins, the cries, and the
rattling of the wheels, at first loud, then fainter and fainter, till
at last it died away in the distance.Nils remained standing
motionless till he heard a little rustling behind him; then he turned
round: it was Arne stealing forth from his hiding-place.he asked; but then he started back a little,
for Nils' face had an evil look.The boy stood silently, waiting for
an answer; but he got none; and at last, becoming impatient, he
ventured to ask, "Are we going now?"Nils was still standing
motionless, looking dreamily in the direction where the bridal train
had gone; then he collected himself, and walked homewards.Arne
followed, and once more began to shoot and to run after his arrows."Don't trample down the meadow," said Nils abruptly.The boy let the
arrow lie and came back; but soon he forgot the warning, and, while
the father once more stood still, he lay down to make somersaults."Don't trample down the meadow, I say," repeated Nils, seizing his
arm and snatching him up by it almost violently enough to sprain it.At the door Margit stood waiting for them.She had just come from the
cow-house, where it seemed she had been working hard, for her hair
was rough, her linen soiled, and her dress untidy; but she stood in
the doorway smiling."Red-side has calved," she said; "and never in
all my life did I see such a great calf.""I think you might make yourself a little tidy of a Sunday," said
Nils as he went past her into the room."Yes, now the work's done, there'll be time for dressing," answered
Margit, following him: and she began to dress, singing meanwhile.Margit now sang very well, though sometimes her voice was a little
hoarse."Leave off that screaming," said Nils, throwing himself upon the bed.Then the boy came bustling in, all out of breath."The calf, the calf's got red marks on each side and a spot on the
forehead, just like his mother."cried Nils, putting down one of his feet
from the bed, and stamping on the floor."The deuce is in that
bustling boy," he growled out, drawing up his foot again."You can see very well father's out of spirits to-day," the mother
said to Arne, by way of warning."Shouldn't you like some strong
coffee with treacle?"she then said, turning to Nils, trying to drive
away his ill-temper.Coffee with treacle had been a favorite drink
with the grandmother and Margit, and Arne liked it too.But Nils
never liked it, though he used to take it with the others."Shouldn't
you like some strong coffee with treacle?"Margit asked again, for he
did not answer the first time.Now, he raised himself on his elbows,
and cried in a loud, harsh voice, "Do you think I'll guzzle that
filthy stuff?"Margit was thunder-struck; and she went out, taking the boy with her.They had several things to do out-doors, and they did not come in
till supper-time; then Nils had gone.Arne was sent out into the
field to call him, but could not find him anywhere.They waited till
the supper was nearly cold; but Nils had not come even when it was
finished.Then Margit grew fidgety, sent Arne to bed, and sat down,
waiting."Where have you been,
dear?""That's no business of yours," he answered, seating himself slowly on
the bench.From that time he often went out into the parish; and he was always
drunk when he came back."I can't bear stopping at home with you," he
once said when he came in.She gently tried to plead her cause; but
he stamped on the floor, and bade her be silent.Was he drunk, then
it was her fault; was he wicked, that was her fault, too; had he
become a <DW36> and an unlucky man for all his life, then, again,
she and that cursed boy of hers were the cause of it."Why were you
always dangling after me?"Margit answered, "was it I that ran after
you?""Yes, that you did," he cried, raising himself; and, still
blubbering, he continued, "Now, at last, it has turned out just as
you would have it: I drag along here day after day--every day looking
on my own grave.But I might have lived in splendor with the first
girl in the parish; I might have travelled as far as the sun; if you
and that cursed boy of yours hadn't put yourselves in my way."Again she tried to defend herself: "It isn't the boy's fault, at any
rate.""Hold your tongue, or I'll strike you!"The next day, when he had slept himself sober, he felt ashamed, and
would especially be kind to the boy.But he was soon drunk again; and
then he beat Margit.At last he beat her almost every time he was
drunk; Arne then cried and fretted, and so he beat him, too; but
often he was so miserable afterwards that he felt obliged to go out
again and take some more spirits.At this time, too, he began once
more to set his mind on going to dancing-parties.He played at them
just as he used to do before his illness; and he took Arne with him
to carry the fiddle-case.At these parties the child saw and heard
much which was not good for him; and the mother often wept because he
was taken there: still she dared not say anything to the father about
it.But to the child she often imploringly said, with many caresses,
"Keep close to God, and don't learn anything wicked."But at the
dancing-parties there was very much to amuse him, while at home with
the mother there was very little; and so he turned more and more away
from her to the father: she saw it, but was silent.He learned many
songs at these parties, and he used to sing them to the father, who
felt amused, and laughed now and then at them.This flattered the boy
so much that he set himself to learn as many songs as he could; and
soon he found out what it was that the father liked, and that made
him laugh.When there was nothing of this kind in the songs, the boy
would himself put something in as well as he could; and thus he early
acquired facility in setting words to music.But lampoons and
disgusting stories about people who had risen to wealth and
influence, were the things which the father liked best, and which the
boy sang.The mother always wished him to go with her in the cow-house to tend
the cattle in the evening.He used to find all sorts of excuses to
avoid going; but it was of no use; she was resolved he should go.There she talked to him about God and good things, and generally
ended by pressing him to her heart, imploring him, with many tears,
not to become a bad man.She helped him, too, in his reading-lessons.He was extremely
quick in learning; and the father felt proud of him, and told
him--especially when he was drunk--that he had _his_ cleverness.At dancing-parties, when the father was drunk, he used often to ask
Arne to sing to the people; and then he would sing song after song,
amidst their loud laughter and applause.This pleased him even more
than it pleased his father; and at last he used to sing songs without
number.Some anxious mothers who heard this, came to Margit and told
her about it, because the subjects of the songs were not such as they
ought to have been.Then she called the boy to her side, and forbade
him, in the name of God and all that was good, to sing such songs any
more.And now it seemed to him that she was always opposed to what
gave him pleasure; and, for the first time in his life, he told the
father what she had said; and when he was again drunk she had to
suffer for it severely: till then he had not spoken of it.Then Arne
saw clearly how wrong a thing he had done, and in the depths of his
soul he asked God and her to forgive him; but he could not ask it in
words.She continued to show him the same kindness as before, and it
pierced his heart.Once, however, in spite of all, he again wronged
her.He had a talent for mimicking people, especially in their
speaking and singing; and one evening, while he was amusing the
father in this way, the mother entered, and, when she was going away,
the father took it into his head to ask him to mimic her.At first he
refused; but the father, who lay on the bed laughing till he shook,
insisted upon his doing it."She's gone," the boy thought, "and can't
hear me;" and he mimicked her singing, just as it was when her voice
was hoarse and obstructed by tears.The father laughed till the boy
grew quite frightened and at once left off.Then the mother came in
from the kitchen, looked at Arne long and mournfully, went over to
the shelf, took down a milk-dish and carried it away.He felt burning hot all over: she had heard it all.He jumped down
from the table where he had been sitting, went out, threw himself on
the ground, and wished to hide himself for ever in the earth.He
could not rest, and he rose and went farther from the house.Passing
by the barn, he there saw his mother sitting, making a new fine shirt
for him.It was her usual habit to sing a hymn while sewing: now,
however, she was silent.Then Arne could bear it no longer; he threw
himself on the grass at her feet, looked up in her face, and wept and
sobbed bitterly.Margit let fall her work, and took his head between
her hands.she said, putting her face down to his.He did not try
to say a word, but wept as he had never wept before."I knew you were
good at heart," she said, stroking his head."Mother, you mustn't refuse what I am now going to ask," were the
first words he was able to utter."You know I never do refuse you," answered she.He tried to stop his tears, and then, with his face still in her
lap, he stammered out, "Do sing a little for me, mother.""You know I can't do it," she said, in a low voice."Sing something for me, mother," implored the boy; "or I shall never
have courage to look you in the face again."She went on stroking his
hair, but was silent."Do sing, mother dear," he implored again; "or
I shall go far away, and never come back any more."Though he was now
almost fifteen years old, he lay there with his head in his mother's
lap, and she began to sing:

   "Merciful Father, take in thy care
      The child as he plays by the shore;
    Send him Thy Holy Spirit there,
      And leave him alone no more.Slipp'ry's the way, and high is the tide;
    Still if Thou keepest close by his side
    He never will drown, but live for Thee,
    And then at the last Thy heaven will see.Wondering where her child is astray,
      The mother stands at the cottage door,
    Calls him a hundred times i' the day,
      And fears he will come no more.But then she thinks, whatever betide,
    The Spirit of God will be his Guide,
    And Christ the blessed, his little Brother,
    Will carry him back to his longing mother."Arne lay still; a blessed peace came over
him, and under its soothing influence he slept.The last word he
heard distinctly was, "Christ;" it transported him into regions of
light; and he fancied that he listened to a chorus of voices, but his
mother's voice was clearer than all.Sweeter tones he had never
heard, and he prayed to be allowed to sing in like manner; and then
at once he began, gently and softly, and still more softly, until
his bliss became rapture, and then suddenly all disappeared.He
awoke, looked about him, listened attentively, but heard nothing save
the little rivulet which flowed past the barn with a low and constant
murmur.The mother was gone; but she had placed the half-made shirt
and his jacket under his head.When now the time of year came for the cattle to be sent into the
wood, Arne wished to go to tend them.But the father opposed him:
indeed, he had never gone before, though he was now in his fifteenth
year.But he pleaded so well, that his wish was at last complied
with; and so during the spring, summer, and autumn, he passed the
whole day alone in the wood, and only came home to sleep.He took his books up there, and read, carved letters in the bark of
the trees, thought, longed, and sang.But when in the evening he came
home and found the father often drunk and beating the mother, cursing
her and the whole parish, and saying how once he might have gone far
away, then a longing for travelling arose in the lad's mind.There
was no comfort for him at home; and his books made his thoughts
travel; nay, it seemed sometimes as if the very breeze bore them on
its wings far away.Then, about midsummer, he met with Christian, the Captain's eldest
son, who one day came to the wood with the servant boy, to catch the
horses, and to ride them home.He was a few years older than Arne,
light-hearted and jolly, restless in mind, but nevertheless strong in
purpose; he spoke fast and abruptly, and generally about two things
at once; shot birds in their flight; rode bare-backed horses;
went fly-fishing; and altogether seemed to Arne the paragon of
perfection.He, too, had set his mind upon travelling, and he talked
to Arne about foreign countries till they shone like fairy-lands.He
found out Arne's love for reading, and he carried up to him all the
books he had read himself; on Sundays he taught him geography from
maps: and during the whole of that summer Arne read till he became
pale and thin.Even when the winter came, he was permitted to read at home; partly
because he was going to be confirmed the next year, and partly
because he always knew how to manage with his father.He also began
to go to school; but while there it seemed to him he never got on so
well as when he shut his eyes and thought over the things in his
books at home: and he no longer had any companions among the boys of
the parish.The father's bodily infirmity, as well as his passion for drinking,
increased with his years; and he treated his wife worse and worse.And while Arne sat at home trying to amuse him, and often, merely to
keep peace for the mother, telling things which he now despised, a
hatred of his father grew up in his heart.But there he kept it
secretly, just as he kept his love for his mother.Even when he
happened to meet Christian, he said nothing to him about home
affairs; but all their talk ran upon their books and their intended
travels.But often when, after those wide roaming conversations, he
was returning home alone, thinking of what he perhaps would have to
see when he arrived there, he wept and prayed that God would take
care he might soon be allowed to go away.In the summer he and Christian were confirmed: and soon afterwards
the latter carried out his purpose of travelling.At last, he
prevailed upon his father to let him be a sailor; and he went far
away; first giving Arne his books, and promising to write often to
him.About this time a wish to make songs awoke again in his mind; and now
he no longer patched old songs, but made new ones for himself, and
said in them whatever most pained him.But soon his heart became too heavy to let him make songs any more.He lay sleepless whole nights, feeling that he could not bear to stay
at home any longer, and that he must go far away, find out Christian,
and--not say a word about it to any one.But when he thought of the
mother, and what would become of her, he could scarcely look her in
the face; and his love made him linger still.One evening when it was growing late, Arne sat reading: indeed, when
he felt more sad than usual he always took refuge in his books;
little understanding that they only increased his burden.The father
had gone to a wedding party, but was expected home that evening; the
mother, weary and afraid of him, had gone to bed.Then Arne was
startled by the sound of a heavy fall in the passage, and of
something hard pushing against the door.It was the father, just
coming home.he muttered; "come and help your father
to get up."Arne helped him up, and brought him to the bench; then
carried in the violin-case after him, and shut the door."Well, look
at me, you clever boy; I don't look very handsome now; Nils, the
tailor's no longer the man he used to be.One thing I--tell--you--you
shall never drink spirits; they're--the devil, the world, and the
flesh.... 'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.'He sat silent for a while, and then sang in a tearful voice,

   "Merciful Lord, I come to Thee;
    Help, if there can be help for me;
    Though by the mire of sin defiled,
    I'm still Thine own dear ransomed child.""'Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof; but
speak the word only....'" He threw himself forward, hid his face in
his hands, and sobbed violently.Then, after lying thus a long while,
he said, word for word out of the Scriptures, just as he had learned
it more than twenty years ago, "'But he answered and said, I am not
sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.Then came she
and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.But he answered and said,
It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
from their master's table.'"Then he was silent, and his weeping became subdued and calm.The mother had been long awake, without looking up; but now when she
heard him weeping thus like one who is saved, she raised herself on
her elbows, and gazed earnestly at him.But scarcely did Nils perceive her before he called out, "Are you
looking up, you ugly vixen!I suppose you would like to see what a
state you have brought me to.... He rose;
and she hid herself under the fur coverlet."Nay, don't hide, I'm
sure to find you," he said, stretching out his right hand and
fumbling with his forefinger on the bed-clothes, "Tickle, tickle," he
said, turning aside the fur coverlet, and putting his forefinger on
her throat."How shrivelled and thin you've become already, there's no depth of
flesh here!"She writhed beneath his touch, and seized his hand with
both hers, but could not free herself.How she wriggles, the ugly thing!Can't
you scream to make believe I am beating you?I only
want to take away your breath."Arne said once more, running to the corner of the room, and
snatching up an axe which stood there."Is it only out of perverseness, you don't scream?you had better
beware; for I've taken such a strange fancy into my head.Now I think I shall soon get rid of that screaming of yours."Arne shouted, rushing towards him with the axe uplifted.But before Arne could reach him, he started up with a piercing cry,
laid his hand upon his heart, and fell heavily down.Arne stood as if rooted in the ground, and gradually lowered the axe.He grew dizzy and bewildered, and scarcely knew where he was.Then
the mother began to move to and fro in the bed, and to breathe
heavily, as if oppressed by some great weight lying upon her.Arne
saw that she needed help; but yet he felt unable to render it.At
last she raised herself a little, and saw the father lying stretched
on the floor, and Arne standing beside him with the axe."Merciful Lord, what have you done?"she cried, springing out of the
bed, putting on her skirt and coming nearer."He fell down himself," said Arne, at last regaining power to speak."Arne, Arne, I don't believe you," said the mother in a stern
reproachful voice: "now Jesus help you!"And she threw herself upon
the dead man with loud wailing.But the boy awoke from his stupor, dropped the axe and fell down on
his knees: "As true as I hope for mercy from God, I've not done it.I
almost thought of doing it; I was so bewildered; but then he fell
down himself; and here I've been standing ever since."The mother looked at him, and believed him."Then our Lord has been
here Himself," she said quietly, sitting down on the floor and gazing
before her.Nils lay quite stiff, with open eyes and mouth, and hands drawn near
together, as though he had at the last moment tried to fold them, but
had been unable to do so.The first thing the mother now did was to
fold them."Let us look closer at him," she said then, going over to
the fireplace, where the fire was almost out.Arne followed her, for
he felt afraid of standing alone.She gave him a lighted fir-splinter
to hold; then she once more went over to the dead body and stood by
one side of it, while the son stood at the other, letting the light
fall upon it."Yes, he's quite gone," she said; and then, after a little while, she
continued, "and gone in an evil hour, I'm afraid."Arne's hands trembled so much that the burning ashes of the splinter
fell upon the father's clothes and set them on fire; but the boy did
not perceive it, neither did the mother at first, for she was
weeping.But soon she became aware of it through the bad smell, and
she cried out in fear.When now the boy looked, it seemed to him as
though the father himself was burning, and he dropped the splinter
upon him, sinking down in a swoon.Up and down, and round and round,
the room moved with him; the table moved, the bed moved; the axe
hewed; the father rose and came to him; and then all of them came
rolling upon him.Then he felt as if a soft cooling breeze passed
over his face; and he cried out and awoke.The first thing he did was
to look at the father, to assure himself that he still lay quietly.And a feeling of inexpressible happiness came over the boy's mind
when he saw that the father was dead--really dead; and he rose as
though he were entering upon a new life.The mother had extinguished the burning clothes, and began to lay out
the body.She made the bed, and then said to Arne, "Take hold of your
father, you're so strong, and help me to lay him nicely."They laid
him on the bed, and Margit shut his eyes and mouth, stretched his
limbs, and folded his hands once more.It was only a little past
midnight, and they had to stay there with him till morning.Arne made
a good fire, and the mother sat down by it.While sitting there, she
looked back upon the many miserable days she had passed with Nils,
and she thanked God for taking him away."But still I had some happy
days with him, too," she said after a while.Arne took a seat opposite her; and, turning to him, she went on, "And
to think that he should have such an end as this!even if he has not
lived as he ought, truly he has suffered for it."She wept, looked
over to the dead man, and continued, "But now God grant I may be
repaid for all I have gone through with him.Arne, you must remember
it was for your sake I suffered it all.""Therefore, you must never leave me," she sobbed; "you are now my
only comfort.""I never will leave you; that I promise before God," the boy said, as
earnestly as if he had thought of saying it for years.He felt a
longing to go over to her; yet he could not.She grew calmer, and, looking kindly over at the dead man, she said,
"After all, there was a great deal of good in him; but the world
dealt hardly by him.... But now he's gone to our Lord, and He'll be
kinder to him, I'm sure."Then, as if she had been following out this
thought within herself, she added, "We must pray for him.If I could,
I would sing over him; but you, Arne, have such a fine voice, you
must go and sing to your father."Arne fetched the hymn-book and lighted a fir-splinter; and, holding
it in one hand and the book in the other, he went to the head of the
bed and sang in a clear voice Kingo's 127th hymn:

   "Regard us again in mercy, O God!And turn Thou aside Thy terrible rod,
    That now in Thy wrath laid on us we see
    To chasten us sore for sin against Thee.""HE HAD IN HIS MIND A SONG."Yet he continued tending the
cattle upon the mountains in the summer, while in the winter he
remained at home studying.About this time the clergyman sent a message, asking him to become
the parish schoolmaster, and saying his gifts and knowledge might
thus be made useful to his neighbors.Arne sent no answer; but the
next day, while he was driving his flock, he made the following
verses:

   "O, my pet lamb, lift your head,
    Though a stony path you tread,
    Over all the lonely fells,
    Only follow still your bells.O, my pet lamb, walk with care;
    Lest you spoil your wool, beware:
    Mother now must soon be sewing
    New lamb-skins, for summer's going.O, my pet lamb, try to grow
    Fat and fine where'er you go:
    Know you not, my little sweeting,
    A spring-lamb is dainty eating?"One day he happened to overhear a conversation between his mother and
the late owner of the place: they were at odds about the horse of
which they were joint-owners."I must wait and hear what Arne says,"
interposed the mother.the man exclaimed; "he would
like the horse to ramble about in the wood, just as he does himself."Then the mother became silent, though before she had been pleading
her cause well.That his mother had to bear people's jeers on
his account, never before occurred to him, and, "Perhaps she had
borne many," he thought."But why had she not told him of it?"He turned the matter over, and then it came into his mind that the
mother scarcely ever talked to him at all.But, then, he scarcely
ever talked to her either.But, after all, whom did he talk much to?Often on Sundays, when he was sitting quietly at home, he would have
liked to read the sermon to his mother, whose eyes were weak, for she
had wept too much in her time.Often, too,
on weekdays, when she was sitting down, and he thought the time might
hang heavy, he would have liked to offer to read some of his own
books to her: still, he did not."Well, never mind," thought he: "I'll soon leave off tending the
cattle on the mountains; and then I'll be more with mother."He let
this resolve ripen within him for several days: meanwhile he drove
his cattle far about in the wood, and made the following verses:

   "The vale is full of trouble, but here sweet Peace may reign;
    Within this quiet forest no bailiffs may distrain;
    None fight, like all in the vale, in the Blessed Church's name;
    But still if a church were here, perhaps 'twould be just the same.Here all are at peace--true, the hawk is rather unkind;
    I fear he is looking now the plumpest sparrow to find;
    I fear yon eagle is coming to rob the kid of his breath;
    But still if he lived very long he might be tired to death.The woodman fells one tree, and another rots away:
    The red fox killed the lambkin at sunset yesterday;
    But the wolf killed the fox; and the wolf, too, had to die,
    For Arne shot him down to-day before the dew was dry.Back I'll go to the valley: the forest is just as bad--
    I must take heed, however, or thinking will drive me mad--
    I saw a boy in my dreams, though where I cannot tell--
    But I know he had killed his father, and I think it was in hell."Then he went home and told the mother she might send for a lad to
tend the cattle on the mountains; and that he would himself manage
the farm: and so it was arranged.But the mother was constantly
hovering about him, warning him not to work too hard.Then, too, she
used to get him such nice meals that he often felt quite ashamed to
take them; yet he said nothing.He had in his mind a song having for its burden, "Over the mountains
high;" but he never could complete it, principally because he always
tried to bring the burden in every alternate line; so afterwards he
gave this up.But several of his songs became known, and were much liked; and many
people, especially those who had known him from his childhood, were
fond of talking to him.But he was shy to all whom he did not know,
and he thought ill of them, mainly because he fancied they thought
ill of him.In the next field to his own worked a middle-aged man named
Opplands-Knut, who used sometimes to sing, but always the same song.After Arne had heard him singing it for several months, he thought he
would ask him whether he did not know any others.Then after a few more days, when he was again singing his
song, Arne asked him, "How came you to learn that one song?"it happened thus----" and then he said no more.Arne went away from him straight indoors; and there he found his
mother weeping; a thing he had not seen her do ever since the
father's death.He turned back again, just as though he did not
notice it; but he felt the mother was looking sorrowfully after him,
and he was obliged to stop.She did not answer, and
all was silent in the room.Then his words came back to him again,
and he felt they had not been spoken so kindly as they ought; and
once more, in a gentler tone, he asked, "What are you crying for,
mother?""Ah, I hardly know," she said, weeping still more.He stood silent a
while; but at last mustered courage to say, "Still, there must be
some reason why you are crying."Again there was silence; but although the mother had not said one
word of blame, he felt he was very guilty towards her."Well it just
came over me," she said after a while; and in a few moments she
added, "but really, I'm very happy;" and then she began weeping
again.Arne hurried out, away to the ravine; and while he sat there looking
into it, he, too, began weeping."If I only knew what I am crying
for," he said.Then he heard Opplands-Knut singing in the fields above him:

   "Ingerid Sletten of Willow-pool
      Had no costly trinkets to wear;
      But a cap she had that was far more fair,
    Although 'twas only of wool.It had no trimming, and now was old;
      But her mother, who long had gone,
      Had given it her, and so it shone
    To Ingerid more than gold.For twenty years she laid it aside,
      That it might not be worn away:
      'My cap I'll wear on that blissful day
    When I shall become a bride.'For thirty years she laid it aside
      Lest the colors might fade away:
      'My cap I'll wear when to God I pray,
    A happy and grateful bride.'For forty years she laid it aside,
      Still holding her mother as dear:
      'My little cap, I certainly fear
    I never shall be a bride.'She went to look for the cap one day
      In the chest where it long had lain;
      But, ah!her looking was all in vain:
    The cap had mouldered away."Arne listened, and the words seemed to him like music playing far
away over the mountains.He went up to Knut and asked him, "Have you
a mother?""Ah, yes; it's long since.""You haven't many, I dare say, who love you?""Haven't you any at all then who love you?""Ah, no; I haven't any."But Arne walked away with his heart so full of love to his mother
that it seemed as if it would burst; and all around him grew bright.He felt he must go in again, if only for the sake of looking at her.As he walked on the thought struck him, "What if I were to lose her?""Almighty God, what would then become of me?"Then he felt as if some dreadful accident was happening at home, and
he hurried onwards, cold drops bursting from his brow, and his feet
hardly touching the ground.He threw open the outer door, and came at
once into an atmosphere of peace.Then he gently opened the door of
the inner room.The mother had gone to bed, and lay sleeping as
calmly as a child, with the moonbeams shining full on her face.A few days after, the mother and son agreed on going together to the
wedding of some relations in one of the neighboring places.The
mother had not been to a party ever since she was a girl; and both
she and Arne knew but very little of the people living around, save
their names.Arne felt uncomfortable at this party, however, for he fancied
everybody was staring at him: and once, as he was passing through the
passage, he believed he heard something said about him, the mere
thought of which made every drop of blood rush into his face.He kept going about looking after the man who had said it, and at
last he took a seat next him.When they were at dinner, the man said, "Well, now, I shall tell you
a story which proves nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't
one day be brought to light;" and Arne fancied he looked at him all
the time he was saying this.He was an ugly-looking man, with scanty
red hair, hanging about a wide, round forehead, small, deep-set eyes,
a little snub-nose, and a large mouth, with pale out-turned lips,
which showed both his gums when he laughed.His hands were resting on
the table; they were large and coarse, but the wrists were slender.He had a fierce look; and he spoke quickly, but with difficulty.The
people called him "Bragger;" and Arne knew that in bygone days, Nils,
the tailor, had treated him badly."Yes," continued the man, "there is indeed, a great deal of sin in
the world; and it sits nearer to us than we think.... But never mind;
I'll tell you now of a foul deed.Those of you who are old will
remember Alf--Alf, the pedlar.'I'll call again,' Alf used to say:
and he has left that saying behind him.When he had struck a
bargain--and what a fellow for trade he was!--he would take up his
bundle, and say, 'I'll call again.'A devil of a fellow, proud
fellow, brave fellow, was he, Alf, the pedlar!"Well he and Big Lazy-bones, Big Lazy-bones--well, you know Big
Lazy-bones?--big he was, and lazy he was, too.He took a fancy to a
coal-black horse that Alf, the pedlar, used to drive, and had trained
to hop like a summer frog.And almost before Big Lazy-bones knew what
he was about, he paid fifty dollars for this horse!Then Big
Lazy-bones, tall as he was, got into a carriage, meaning to drive
about like a king with his fifty-dollar-horse; but, though he whipped
and swore like a devil, the horse kept running against all the doors
and windows; for it was stone-blind!"Afterwards, whenever Alf and Big Lazy-bones came across each other,
they used to quarrel and fight about this horse like two dogs.Big
Lazy-bones said he would have his money back; but he could not get a
farthing of it: and Alf drubbed him till the bristles flew.'I'll
call again,' said Alf.A devil of a fellow, proud fellow, brave
fellow that Alf--Alf, the pedlar!"Well, after that some years passed away without his being seen
again."Then, in about ten years or so, a call for him was published on the
church-hill,[2] for a great fortune had been left him.'Ah,' said he, 'I well knew it must be
money, and not men, that called out for Alf, the pedlar.'[2] In Norway, certain public announcements are made before the
 church door on Sundays after service.--Translators."Now, there was a good deal of talk one way and another about Alf;
and at last it seemed to be pretty clearly made out that he had been
seen for the last time on _this_ side of the ledge, and not on the
other.Well, you remember the road over the ledge--the old road?"Of late, Big Lazy-bones had got quite a great man, and he owned both
houses and land.Then, too, he had taken to being religious; and
that, everybody knew, he didn't take to for nothing--nobody does."Just at this time the road over the ledge had to be altered.Folks
in bygone days had a great fancy for going straight onwards; and so
the old road ran straight over the ledge; but now-a-days we like to
have things smooth and easy; and so the new road was made to run down
along the river.While they were making it, there was digging and
mining enough to bring down the whole mountain about their ears; and
the magistrates and all the officers who have to do with that sort of
thing were there.One day while the men were digging deep in the
stony ground, one of them took up something which he thought was a
stone; but it turned out to be the bones of a man's hand instead; and
a wonderfully strong hand it seemed to be, for the man who got it
fell flat down directly.The magistrate
was just strolling about round there, and they fetched him to the
place; and then all the bones belonging to a whole man were dug out.The Doctor, too, was fetched; and he put them all together so
cleverly that nothing was wanting but the flesh.And then it struck
some of the people that the skeleton was just about the same size
and make as Alf, the pedlar.'I'll call again,' Alf used to say."And then it struck somebody else, that it was a very queer thing a
dead hand should have made a great fellow like Big Lazy-bones fall
flat down like that: and the magistrate accused him straight of
having had more to do with that dead hand than he ought--of course,
when nobody else was by.But then Big Lazy-bones foreswore it with
such fearful oaths that the magistrate turned quite giddy.'Well,'
said the magistrate, 'if you didn't do it, I dare say you're a
fellow, now, who would not mind sleeping with the skeleton
to-night?'--'No; I shouldn't mind a bit,--not I,' said Big
Lazy-bones.So the Doctor tied the joints of the skeleton together,
and laid it in one of the beds in the barracks; and put another bed
close by it for Big Lazy-bones.The magistrate wrapped himself in his
cloak, and lay down close to the door outside.When night came on,
and Big Lazy-bones had to go in to his bedfellow, the door shut
behind him as though of itself, and he stood in the dark.But then
Big Lazy-bones set off singing psalms, for he had a mighty voice.'May be the bells were never tolled for him,' answered Big
Lazy-bones.Then he began praying out loud, as earnestly as ever he
could.asked the magistrate from outside the
wall.'No doubt, he has been a great sinner,' answered Big
Lazy-bones.Then a time after, all got so still that the magistrate
might have gone to sleep.But then came a shrieking that made the
very barracks shake: 'I'll call again!'--Then came a hellish noise
and crash: 'Out with that fifty dollars of mine!'roared Big
Lazy-bones: and the shrieking and crashing came again.Then the
magistrate burst open the door; the people rushed in with poles and
firebrands; and there lay Big Lazy-bones on the floor, with the
skeleton on the top of him."There was a deep silence all round the table.At last a man who was
lighting his clay-pipe said, "Didn't he go mad from that very time?"Arne fancied everybody was looking at him, and he dared not raise his
eyes."I say, as I said before," continued the man who had told the
tale, "nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't one day be
brought to light.""Well, now I'll tell you about a son who beat his own father," said a
fair stout man with a round face.Arne no longer knew where he was
sitting."This son was a great fellow, almost a giant, belonging to a tall
family in Hardanger; and he was always at odds with somebody or
other.He and his father were always quarrelling about the yearly
allowance; and so he had no peace either at home or out."This made him grow more and more wicked; and the father persecuted
him.'I won't be put down by anybody,' the son said.'Yes, you'll be
put down by me so long as I live,' the father answered.'If you don't
hold your tongue,' said the son, rising, 'I'll strike you.'--'Well,
do if you dare; and never in this world will you have luck again,'
answered the father, rising also.--'Do you mean to say that?'said
the son; and he rushed upon him and knocked him down.But the father
didn't try to help himself: he folded his arms and let the son do
just as he liked with him.Then he knocked him about, rolled him over
and over, and dragged him towards the door by his white hair.'I'll
have peace in my own house, at any rate,' said he.But when they had
come to the door, the father raised himself a little and cried out,
'Not beyond the door, for so far I dragged my own father.'The son
didn't heed it, but dragged the old man's head over the threshold.And the old man rose, knocked down the
son and beat him as one would beat a child.""Ah, that's a sad story," several said.Then Arne fancied he heard
some one saying, "It's a wicked thing to strike one's father;" and he
rose, turning deadly pale."Now I'll tell _you_ something," he said; but he hardly knew what he
was going to say: words seemed flying around him like large
snowflakes."I'll catch them at random," he said and began:--

"A troll once met a lad walking along the road weeping.'Whom are
you most afraid of?'asked the troll, 'yourself or others?'Now,
the boy was weeping because he had dreamed last night he had killed
his wicked father; and so he answered, 'I'm most afraid of
myself.'--'Then fear yourself no longer, and never weep again; for
henceforward you shall only have strife with others.'But the first whom the lad met jeered at him; and so
the lad jeered at him again.The second he met beat him; and so he
beat him again.The third he met tried to kill him; and so the lad
killed him.Then all the people spoke ill of the lad; and so he spoke
ill again of all the people.They shut the doors against him, and
kept all their things away from him; so he stole what he wanted; and
he even took his night's rest by stealth.As now they wouldn't let
him come to do anything good, he only did what was bad; and all that
was bad in other people, they let him suffer for.And the people in
the place wept because of the mischief done by the lad; but he did
not weep himself, for he could not.Then all the people met together
and said, 'Let's go and drown him, for with him we drown all the
evil that is in the place.'So they drowned him forthwith; but
afterwards they thought the well where he was drowned gave forth a
mighty odor."The lad himself didn't at all know he had done anything wrong; and
so after his death he came drifting in to our Lord.There, sitting on
a bench, he saw his father, whom he had not killed, after all; and
opposite the father, on another bench, sat the one whom he had jeered
at, the one he had beaten, the one he had killed, and all those whom
he had stolen from, and those whom he had otherwise wronged."'Whom are you afraid of,' our Lord asked, 'of your father, or of
those on the long bench?'"'Sit down then by your father,' said our Lord; and the lad went to
sit down.But then the father fell down from the bench with a large
axe-cut in his neck.In his seat, came one in the likeness of the lad
himself, but with a thin and ghastly pale face; another with a
drunkard's face, matted hair, and drooping limbs; and one more with
an insane face, torn clothes, and frightful laughter."'So it might have happened to you,' said our Lord.said the boy, catching hold of the Lord's coat."Then both the benches fell down from heaven; but the boy remained
standing near the Lord rejoicing."'Remember this when you awake,' said our Lord; and the boy awoke."The boy who dreamed so is I; those who tempted him by thinking him
bad are you.I am no longer afraid of myself, but I am afraid of you.Do not force me to evil; for it is uncertain if I get hold of the
Lord's coat."He ran out: the men looked at each other.THE SOLILOQUY IN THE BARN.On the evening of the day after this, Arne was lying in a barn
belonging to the same house.For the first time in his life he had
become drunk, and he had been lying there for the last twenty-four
hours.Now he sat up, resting upon his elbows, and talked with
himself:

"... Everything I look at turns to cowardice.It was cowardice that
hindered me from running away while a boy; cowardice that made me
listen to father more than to mother; cowardice also made me sing
the wicked songs to him.I began tending the cattle through
cowardice,--to read--well, that, too, was through cowardice: I
wished to get away from myself.When, though a grown up lad, yet
I didn't help mother against father--cowardice; that I didn't that
night--ugh!--cowardice!I might perhaps have waited till she was
killed!... I couldn't bear to stay at home afterwards--cowardice;
still I didn't go away--cowardice; I did nothing, I tended cattle...
cowardice.'Tis true I promised mother to stay at home; still I
should have been cowardly enough to break my promise if I hadn't been
afraid of mixing among people.For I'm afraid of people, mainly
because I think they see how bad I am; and because I'm afraid of
them, I speak ill of them--a curse upon my cowardice!I'm afraid of thinking bravely about my own
affairs, and so I turn aside and think about other people's; and
making verses is just that."I've cause enough to weep till the hills turned to lakes, but
instead of that I say to myself, 'Hush, hush,' and begin rocking.And
even my songs are cowardly; for if they were bold they would be
better.I'm afraid of strong thoughts; afraid of anything that's
strong; and if ever I rise into it, it's in a passion, and passion is
cowardice.I'm more clever and know more than I seem; I'm better than
my words, but my cowardice makes me afraid of showing myself in my
true colors.I drank that spirits through cowardice;
I wanted to deaden my pain--shame upon me!I felt miserable all
the while I was drinking it, yet I drank; drank my father's
heart's-blood, and still I drank!In fact there's no end to my
cowardice; and the most cowardly thing is, that I can sit and tell
myself all this!I am a vast deal too cowardly for that.Then, too, I believe a little in God... yes, I believe in God.I
would fain go to Him; but cowardice keeps me from going: it would be
such a great change that a coward shrinks from it.But if I were to
put forth what power I have?Thou wouldst
cure me in such a way as my milky spirit can bear; wouldst lead me
gently; for I have no bones in me, nor even gristle--nothing but
jelly.If I tried... with good, gentle books,--I'm afraid of the
strong ones--; with pleasant tales, stories, all that is mild, and
then a sermon every Sunday, and a prayer every evening.If I tried to
clear a field within me for religion; and worked in good earnest, for
one cannot sow in laziness.If I tried; dear mild God of my
childhood, if I tried!"But then the barn-door was opened, and the mother came rushing across
the floor.Her face was deadly pale, though the perspiration dropped
from it like great tears.For the last twenty-four hours she had
been rushing hither and thither, seeking her son, calling his name,
and scarcely pausing even to listen, until now when he answered from
the barn.Then she gave a loud cry, jumped upon the hay-mow more
lightly than a boy, and threw herself upon Arne's breast....

... "Arne, Arne are you here?At last I've found you; I've been
looking for you ever since yesterday; I've been looking for you all
night long!I saw they worried you, and I wanted to
come to speak to you and comfort you, but really I'm always afraid!"... "Arne, I saw you drinking spirits!Almighty God, may I never see
it again!It was some minutes
before she was able to speak again."Christ have mercy upon you, my
boy, I saw you drinking spirits!... You were gone all at once, drunk
and crushed by grief as you were!I ran all over the place; I went
far into the fields; but I couldn't find you: I looked in every
copse; I questioned everybody; I came here, too; but you didn't
answer.... Arne, Arne, I went along the river; but it seemed nowhere
to be deep enough...." She pressed herself closer to him."Then it came into my mind all at once that you might have gone home;
and I'm sure I was only a quarter of an hour going there.I opened
the outer-door and looked in every room; and then, for the first
time, I remembered that the house had been locked up, and I myself
had the key; and that you could not have come in, after all.Arne,
last night I looked all along both sides of the road: I dared not go
to the edge of the ravine.... I don't know how it was I came here
again; nobody told me; it must have been the Lord himself who put it
into my mind that you might be here!"She paused and lay for a while with her head upon his breast."Arne, you'll never drink spirits again, I'm sure?""No; you may be sure I never will.""I believe they were very hard upon you?"No; it was I who was _cowardly_," he answered, laying a great stress
upon the word."I can't understand how they could behave badly to you.But, tell me,
what did they do?you never will tell me anything;" and once more she
began weeping."But you never tell me anything, either," he said in a low gentle
voice."Yet you're the most in fault, Arne: I've been so long used to
be silent through your father; you ought to have led me on a
little.--Good Lord!we've only each other; and we've suffered so
much together.""Well, we must try to manage better," Arne whispered.... "Next Sunday I'll read the sermon to you.""I've greatly sinned against you; I've done something very wrong.""Indeed, I have; but I couldn't help doing it."But I'm sure you've never done anything wrong to me.""Indeed, I have: and my very love to you made me do it.But you must
forgive me; will you?""And then another time I'll tell you all about it... but you must
forgive me!""And don't you see the reason why I couldn't talk much to you was,
that I had this on my mind?"Pray don't talk so, mother!""Well, I'm glad I've said what I have.""And, mother, we'll talk more together, we two.""Yes, that we will; and then you'll read the sermon to me?""I think we both had better go home now.""Yes; your father once lay weeping in this barn.""You're looking all round, Arne?""It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      No rest indoors could I find;
    So I strolled to the wood, and down I lay,
      And rocked what came in my mind:
    But there the emmets crawled on the ground,
    And wasps and gnats were stinging around.'Won't you go out-doors this fine day, dear?'said mother, as she sat
in the porch, spinning.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      No rest indoors could I find;
    So I went in the birk, and down I lay,
      And sang what came in my mind:
    But snakes crept out to bask in the sun--
    Snakes five feet long, so, away I run.'In such beautiful weather one may go barefoot,' said mother, taking
off her stockings.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      Indoors I could not abide;
    So I went in a boat, and down I lay,
      And floated away with the tide:
    But the sun-beams burned till my nose was sore;
    So I turned my boat again to the shore.'This is, indeed, good weather to dry the hay,' said mother, putting
her rake into a swath.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      In the house I could not be;
    And so from the heat I climbed away
      In the boughs of a shady tree:
    But caterpillars dropped on my face,
    So down I jumped and ran from the place.'Well, if the cow doesn't get on to-day, she never will get on,' said
mother, glancing up towards the <DW72>.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      Indoors I could not remain:
    And so for quiet I rowed away
      To the waterfall amain:
    But there I drowned while bright was the sky:
    If you made this, it cannot be I.'Only three more such sunny days, and we shall get in all the hay,'
said mother, as she went to make my bed."Arne when a child had not cared much for fairy-tales; but now he
began to love them, and they led him to the sagas and old ballads.He
also read sermons and other religious books; and he was gentle and
kind to all around him.But in his mind arose a strange deep longing:
he made no more songs; but walked often alone, not knowing what was
within him.Many of the places around, which formerly he had not even noticed,
now appeared to him wondrously beautiful.At the time he and his
schoolfellows had to go to the Clergyman to be prepared for
confirmation, they used to play near a lake lying just below the
parsonage, and called the Swart-water because it lay deep and dark
between the mountains.He now often thought of this place; and one
evening he went thither.He sat down behind a grove close to the parsonage, which was built on
a steep hill-side, rising high above till it became a mountain.High
mountains rose likewise on the opposite shore, so that broad deep
shadows fell upon both sides of the lake, but in the middle ran a
stripe of bright silvery water.It was a calm evening near sunset,
and not a sound was heard save the tinkling of the cattle-bells from
the opposite shore.Arne at first did not look straight before him,
but downwards along the lake, where the sun was sprinkling burning
red ere it sank to rest.There, at the end, the mountains gave way,
and between them lay a long low valley, against which the lake beat;
but they seemed to run gradually towards each other, and to hold the
valley in a great swing.Houses lay thickly scattered all along, the
smoke rose and curled away, the fields lay green and reeking, and
boats laden with hay were anchored by the shore.Arne saw many people
going to and fro, but he heard no noise.Thence his eye went along
the shore towards God's dark wood upon the mountain-sides.Through
it, man had made his way, and its course was indicated by a winding
stripe of dust.This, Arne's eye followed to opposite where he was
sitting: there, the wood ended, the mountains opened, and houses lay
scattered all over the valley.They were nearer and looked larger
than those in the other valley; and they were red-painted, and their
large windows glowed in the sunbeams.The fields and meadows stood in
strong light, and the smallest child playing in them was clearly
seen; glittering white sands lay dry upon the shore, and some dogs
and puppies were running there.But suddenly all became sunless and
gloomy: the houses looked dark red, the meadows dull green, the sand
greyish white, and the children little clumps: a cloud of mist had
risen over the mountains, taking away the sunlight.Arne looked down
into the water, and there he found all once more: the fields lay
rocking, the wood silently drew near, the houses stood looking down,
the doors were open, and children went out and in.Fairy-tales and
childish things came rushing into his mind, as little fishes come to
a bait, swim away, come once more and play round, and again swim
away."Let's sit down here till your mother comes; I suppose the
Clergyman's lady will have finished sometime or other."Arne was
startled: some one had been sitting a little way behind him."If I might but stay this one night more," said an imploring voice,
half smothered by tears: it seemed to be that of a girl not quite
grown up."Now don't cry any more; it's wrong to cry because you're going home
to your mother," was slowly said by a gentle voice, which was
evidently that of a man."It's not that, I am crying for.""Because I shall not live any longer with Mathilde."This was the name of the Clergyman's only daughter; and Arne
remembered that a peasant-girl had been brought up with her."Still, that couldn't go on for ever.""Well, but only one day more father, dear!""No, it's better we take you home now; perhaps, indeed, it's already
too late.""You were born a peasant, and a peasant you shall be; we can't afford
to keep a lady.""But I might remain a peasant all the same if I stayed there.""I've always worn my peasant's dress.""Clothes have nothing to do with it.""I've spun, and woven, and done cooking.""I can speak just as you and mother speak.""Well, then, I really don't know what it is," the girl said,
laughing."Time will show; but I'm afraid you've already got too many
thoughts."so you always say; I have no thoughts;" and she
wept."Ah, you're a wind-mill, that you are.""No; but now _I_ say it."Now the girl laughed; but after a while she said gravely, "It's wrong
of you to say I'm nothing.""Dear me, when you said so yourself!""Nay; I won't be nothing."Again she laughed; but after a while she said in a sad tone, "The
Clergyman never used to make a fool of me in this way.""No; but he _did_ make a fool of you."well, you've never been so kind to me as he was.""No; and if I had I should have spoiled you.""Well, sour milk can never become sweet.""It may when it is boiled to whey.""Such a long-winded woman as that Clergyman's lady, I never met with
in all my live-long days," interposed a sharp quick voice."Now, make
haste, Baard; get up and push off the boat, or we sha'n't get home
to-night.The lady wished me to take care that Eli's feet were kept
dry.Dear me, she must attend to that herself!Then she said Eli must
take a walk every morning for the sake of her health!Well, get up, Baard, and push off the boat;
I have to make the dough this evening.""The chest hasn't come yet," he said, without rising."But the chest isn't to come; it's to be left there till next Sunday.Well, Eli, get up; take your bundle, and come on.Away she went, followed by the girl.Arne then heard the same voice say from the shore
below."Have you looked after the plug in the boat?""Yes, it's put in;" and then Arne heard her drive it in with a scoop."But do get up, Baard; I suppose we're not going to stay here all
night?"But bless you, dear, haven't I told you it's to be left there till
next Sunday?""Here it comes," Baard said, as the rattling of a cart was heard."Why, I said it was to be left till next Sunday.""I said we were to take it with us."Away went the wife to the cart, and carried the bundle and other
small things down into the boat.Then Baard rose, went up, and took
down the chest himself.But a girl with streaming hair, and a straw bonnet came running after
the cart: it was the Clergyman's daughter."Mathilde, Mathilde," was answered; and the two girls ran towards
each other.They met on the hill, embraced each other and wept.Then
Mathilde took out something which she had set down on the grass: it
was a bird in a cage."You shall have Narrifas," she said; "mamma wishes you to have it
too; you shall have Narrifas... you really shall--and then you'll
think of me--and very often row over to me;" and again they wept
much.Arne heard the mother
say from the shore below."But I'll go with you," said Mathilde.and, with their arms round each other's neck, they ran
down to the landing-place.In a few minutes Arne saw the boat on the water, Eli standing high in
the stern, holding the bird-cage, and waving her hand; while Mathilde
sat alone on the stones of the landing-place weeping.She remained sitting there watching the boat as long as it was on the
water; and so did Arne.The distance across the lake to the red
houses was but short; the boat soon passed into the dark shadows, and
he saw it come ashore.Then he saw in the water the reflections of
the three who had just landed, and in it he followed them on their
way to the red houses till they reached the finest of them; there he
saw them go in; the mother first, next, the father, and last, the
daughter.But soon the daughter came out again, and seated herself
before the storehouse; perhaps to look across to the parsonage, over
which the sun was laying its last rays.But Mathilde had already
gone, and it was only Arne who was sitting there looking at Eli in
the water."I wonder whether she sees me," he thought....

He rose and went away.The sun had set, but the summer night was
light and the sky clear blue.The mist from the lake and the valleys
rose, and lay along the mountain-sides, but their peaks were left
clear, and stood looking over to each other.He went higher: the
water lay black and deep below; the distant valley shortened and drew
nearer the lake; the mountains came nearer the eye and gathered in
clumps; the sky itself was lower; and all things became friendly and
familiar."Fair Venevill bounded on lithesome feet
            Her lover to meet.He sang till it sounded afar away,
            'Good-day, good-day,'
    While blithesome birds were singing on every blooming spray.On Midsummer-day
            There is dancing and play;
    But now I know not whether she weaves her wreath or nay."She wove him a wreath of corn-flowers blue:
            'Mine eyes so true.'He took it, but soon away it was flung:
            'Farewell!'he sung;
    And still with merry singing across the fields he sprung.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a chain: 'Oh keep it with care;
            'Tis made of my hair.'She yielded him then, in an hour of bliss,
            Her pure first kiss;
    But he blushed as deeply as she the while her lips met his
            On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a wreath with a lily-band:
            'My true right hand.'She wove him another with roses aglow:
            'My left hand now.'He took them gently from her, but blushes dyed his brow.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a wreath of all flowers round:
            'All I have found.'She wept, but she gathered and wove on still:
            'Take all you will.'Without a word he took it, and fled across the hill.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove on bewildered and out of breath:
            'My bridal wreath.'She wove till her fingers aweary had grown:
            'Now put it on:'
    But when she turned to see him, she found that he had gone.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove on in haste, as for life or death,
            Her bridal wreath;
        But the Midsummer sun no longer shone,
            And the flowers were gone;
    But though she had no flowers, wild fancy still wove on.On Midsummer-day
            There is dancing and play;
    But now I know not whether she weaves her wreath or nay."Arne had of late been happier, both when at home and when out among
people.In the winter, when he had not work enough on his own place,
he went out in the parish and did carpentry; but every Saturday night
he came home to the mother; and went with her to church on Sunday, or
read the sermon to her; and then returned in the evening to his place
of work.But soon, through going more among people, his wish to
travel awoke within him again; and just after his merriest moods, he
would often lie trying to finish his song, "Over the mountains high,"
and altering it for about the twentieth time.He often thought of
Christian, who seemed to have so utterly forgotten him, and who, in
spite of his promise, had not sent him even a single letter.Once,
the remembrance of Christian came upon him so powerfully that he
thoughtlessly spoke of him to the mother; she gave no answer, but
turned away and went out.There was living in the parish a jolly man named Ejnar Aasen.When he
was twenty years old he broke his leg, and from that time he had
walked with the support of a stick; but wherever he appeared limping
along on that stick, there was always merriment going on.The man was
rich, and he used the greater part of his wealth in doing good; but
he did it all so quietly that few people knew anything about it.There was a large nut-wood on his property; and on one of the
brightest mornings in harvest-time, he always had a nutting-party of
merry girls at his house, where he had abundance of good cheer for
them all day, and a dance in the evening.He was the godfather of
most of the girls; for he was the godfather of half of the parish.All the children called him Godfather, and from them everybody else
had learned to call him so, too.He and Arne knew each other well; and he liked Arne for the sake of
his songs.Now he invited him to the nutting-party; but Arne
declined: he was not used to girls' company, he said."Then you had
better get used to it," answered Godfather.So Arne came to the party, and was nearly the only young man among
the many girls.Such fun as was there, Arne had never seen before in
all his life; and one thing which especially astonished him was, that
the girls laughed for nothing at all: if three laughed, then five
would laugh just because those three laughed.Altogether, they
behaved as if they had lived with each other all their lives; and yet
there were several of them who had never met before that very day.When they caught the bough which they jumped after, they laughed, and
when they did not catch it they laughed also; when they did not find
any nuts, they laughed because they found none; and when they did
find some, they also laughed.They fought for the nutting-hook: those
who got it laughed, and those who did not get it laughed also.Godfather limped after them, trying to beat them with his stick, and
making all the mischief he was good for; those he hit, laughed
because he hit them, and those he missed, laughed because he missed
them.But the whole lot laughed at Arne because he was so grave; and
when at last he could not help laughing, they all laughed again
because he laughed.Then the whole party seated themselves on a large hill; the girls in
a circle, and Godfather in the middle.The sun was scorching hot, but
they did not care the least for it, but sat cracking nuts, giving
Godfather the kernels, and throwing the shells and husks at each
other.Godfather'sh'shed at them, and, as far as he could reach,
beat them with his stick; for he wanted to make them be quiet and
tell tales.But to stop their noise seemed just about as easy as to
stop a carriage running down a hill.Godfather began to tell a tale,
however.At first many of them would not listen; they knew his
stories already; but soon they all listened attentively; and before
they thought of it, they set off tale-telling themselves at full
gallop.Though they had just been so noisy, their tales, to Arne's
great surprise, were very earnest: they ran principally upon love."You, Aasa, know a good tale, I remember from last year," said
Godfather, turning to a plump girl with a round, good-natured face,
who sat plaiting the hair of a younger sister, whose head lay in her
lap."But perhaps several know it already," answered Aasa."Never mind, tell it," they begged."Very well, I'll tell it without any more persuading," she answered;
and then, plaiting her sister's hair all the while, she told and
sang:--

"There was once a grown-up lad who tended cattle, and who often drove
them upwards near a broad stream.On one side was a high steep cliff,
jutting out so far over the stream that when he was upon it he could
talk to any one on the opposite side; and all day he could see a girl
over there tending cattle, but he couldn't go to her.'Now, tell me thy name, thou girl that art sitting
    Up there with thy sheep, so busily knitting,'

he asked over and over for many days, till one day at last there came
an answer:--

   'My name floats about like a duck in wet weather;
    Come over, thou boy in the cap of brown leather.'"This left the lad no wiser than he was before; and he thought he
wouldn't mind her any further.This, however, was much more easily
thought than done, for drive his cattle whichever way he would, it
always, somehow or other, led to that same high steep cliff.Then the
lad grew frightened; and he called over to her--

   'Well, who is your father, and where are you biding?On the road to the church I have ne'er seen you riding.'"The lad asked this because he half believed she was a huldre.[3]

 [3] "Over the whole of Norway, the tradition is current of a
 supernatural being that dwells in the forests and mountains, called
 Huldre or Hulla.She appears like a beautiful woman, and is usually
 clad in a blue petticoat and a white snood; but unfortunately has a
 long tail, which she anxiously tries to conceal when she is among
 people.She is fond of cattle, particularly brindled, of which she
 possesses a beautiful and thriving stock.She was once at a merrymaking, where every one was desirous of
 dancing with the handsome, strange damsel; but in the midst of the
 mirth, a young man, who had just begun a dance with her, happened
 to cast his eye on her tail.Immediately guessing whom he had got
 for a partner, he was not a little terrified; but, collecting
 himself, and unwilling to betray her, he merely said to her when
 the dance was over, 'Fair maid, you will lose your garter.'She
 instantly vanished, but afterwards rewarded the silent and
 considerate youth with beautiful presents and a good breed of
 cattle.The idea entertained of this being is not everywhere the
 same, but varies considerably in different parts of Norway.In some
 places she is described as a handsome female when seen in front,
 but is hollow behind, or else blue; while in others she is known by
 the name of Skogmerte, and is said to be blue, but clad in a green
 petticoat, and probably corresponds to the Swedish Skogsnyfoor.Her
 song--a sound often heard among the mountains--is said to be hollow
 and mournful, differing therein from the music of the subterranean
 beings, which is described by earwitnesses as cheerful and
 fascinating.But she is not everywhere regarded as a solitary wood
 nymph.Huldremen and Huldrefolk are also spoken of, who live
 together in the mountains, and are almost identical with the
 subterranean people.In Hardanger the Huldre people are always clad
 in green, but their cattle are blue, and may be taken when a
 grown-up person casts his belt over them.The Huldres take possession of the forsaken pasture-spots in
 the mountains, and invite people into their mounds, where
 delightful music is to be heard."--_Thorpe's Northern Mythology._

   'My house is burned down, and my father is drowned,
    And the road to the church-hill I never have found.'"This again left the lad no wiser than he was before.In the daytime
he kept hovering about the cliff; and at night he dreamed she danced
with him, and lashed him with a big cow's tail whenever he tried to
catch her.Soon he could neither sleep nor work; and altogether the
lad got in a very poor way.Then once more he called from the cliff--

   'If thou art a huldre, then pray do not spell me;
    If thou art a maiden, then hasten to tell me.'"But there came no answer; and so he was sure she was a huldre.He
gave up tending cattle; but it was all the same; wherever he went,
and whatever he did, he was all the while thinking of the beautiful
huldre who blew on the horn.Soon he could bear it no longer; and one
moonlight evening when all were asleep, he stole away into the
forest, which stood there all dark at the bottom, but with its
tree-tops bright in the moonbeams.He sat down on the cliff, and
called--

   'Run forward, my huldre; my love has o'ercome me;
    My life is a burden; no longer hide from me.'"The lad looked and looked; but she didn't appear.Then he heard
something moving behind him; he turned round and saw a big black
bear, which came forward, squatted on the ground and looked at him.But he ran away from the cliff and through the forest as fast as his
legs could carry him: if the bear followed him, he didn't know, for
he didn't turn round till he lay safely in bed."'It was one of her herd,' the lad thought; 'it isn't worth while to
go there any more;' and he didn't go."Then, one day, while he was chopping wood, a girl came across the
yard who was the living picture of the huldre: but when she drew
nearer, he saw it wasn't she.Then he saw
the girl coming back, and again while she was at a distance she
seemed to be the huldre, and he ran to meet her; but as soon as he
came near, he saw it wasn't she."After this, wherever the lad was--at church at dances, or any other
parties--the girl was, too; and still when at a distance she seemed
to be the huldre, and when near she was somebody else.Then he asked
her whether she was the huldre or not, but she only laughed at him.'One may as well leap into it as creep into it,' the lad thought; and
so he married the girl."But the lad had hardly done this before he ceased to like the girl:
when he was away from her he longed for her; but when he was with her
he yearned for some one he did not see.So the lad behaved very badly
to his wife; but she suffered in silence."Then one day when he was out looking for his horses, he came again
to the cliff; and he sat down and called out--

   'Like fairy moonlight, to me thou seemest;
    Like Midsummer-fires, from afar thou gleamest.'"He felt that it did him good to sit there; and afterwards he went
whenever things were wrong at home."But one day when he was sitting there, he saw the huldre sitting all
alive on the other side blowing her horn.He called over--

   'Ah, dear, art thou come!"Then she answered--

   'Away from thy mind the dreams I am blowing;
    Thy rye is all rotting for want of mowing.'"But then the lad felt frightened and went home again.Ere long,
however, he grew so tired of his wife that he was obliged to go to
the forest again, and he sat down on the cliff.Then was sung over to
him--

   'I dreamed thou wast here; ho, hasten to bind me!No; not over there, but behind you will find me.'"The lad jumped up and looked around him, and caught a glimpse of a
green petticoat just slipping away between the shrubs.He followed,
and it came to a hunting all through the forest.So swift-footed as
that huldre, no human creature could be: he flung steel over her
again and again, but still she ran on just as well as ever.But soon
the lad saw, by her pace, that she was beginning to grow tired,
though he saw, too, by her shape, that she could be no other than the
huldre.'Now,' he thought, you'll be mine easily;' and he caught hold
on her so suddenly and roughly that they both fell, and rolled down
the hills a long way before they could stop themselves.Then the
huldre laughed till it seemed to the lad the mountains sang again.He
took her upon his knee; and so beautiful she was, that never in all
his life he had seen any one like her: exactly like her, he thought
his wife should have been.'Ah, who are you who are so beautiful?'he
asked, stroking her cheek.'I'm your wife,' she
answered."The girls laughed much at that tale, and ridiculed the lad.But
Godfather asked Arne if he had listened well to it."Well, now I'll tell you something," said a little girl with a little
round face, and a very little nose:--

"Once there was a little lad who wished very much to woo a little
girl.They were both grown up; but yet they were very little.And the
lad couldn't in any way muster courage to ask her to have him.He
kept close to her when they came home from church; but, somehow or
other, their chat was always about the weather.He went over to her
at the dancing-parties, and nearly danced her to death; but still he
couldn't bring himself to say what he wanted.'You must learn to
write,' he said to himself; 'then you'll manage matters.'And the lad
set to writing; but he thought it could never be done well enough;
and so he wrote a whole year round before he dared do his letter.Now, the thing was to get it given to her without anybody seeing.He
waited till one day when they were standing all by themselves behind
the church.'I've got a letter for you,' said the lad.'But I can't
read writing,' the girl answered."Then he went to service at the girl's father's house; and he used to
keep hovering round her all day long.Once he had nearly brought
himself to speak; in fact, he had already opened his mouth; but then
a big fly flew in it.'Well, I hope, at any rate, nobody else will
come to take her away,' the lad thought; but nobody came to take her,
because she was so very little."By-and-by, however, some one _did_ come, and he, too, was little.The lad could see very well what he wanted; and when he and the girl
went up-stairs together, the lad placed himself at the key-hole.Then
he who was inside made his offer.'Bad luck to me, I, codfish, who
didn't make haste!'He who was inside kissed the
girl just on her lips----.'No doubt that tasted nice,' the lad
thought.But he who was inside took the girl on his lap.Then the
girl heard him and went to the door.'What do you want, you nasty
boy?'said she, 'why can't you leave me alone?'--'I?I only wanted to
ask you to have me for your bridesman.'--'No; that, my brother's
going to be,' the girl answered, banging the door to.The girls laughed very much at this tale, and afterwards pelted each
other with husks.Then Godfather wished Eli Boeen to tell something."Well, she might tell what she had told him on the hill, the last
time he came to see her parents, when she gave him the new garters.Eli laughed very much; and it was some time before she would tell it:
however, she did at last,--

"A lad and a girl were once walking together on a road.'Ah, look at
that thrush that follows us!''It follows _me_,' said
the lad.'It's just as likely to be _me_,' the girl answered.'That,
we'll soon find out,' said the lad; 'you go that way, while I go
this, and we'll meet up yonder.''Well, didn't it follow
me?''No; it followed me,' answered the
girl.They went together again for some
distance, but then there was only one thrush; and the lad thought it
flew on his side, but the girl thought it flew on hers.'Devil a bit,
I care for that thrush,' said the lad."But no sooner had they said this, than the thrush flew away.'It was
on _your_ side, it was,' said the lad.'Thank you,' answered the
girl; 'but I clearly saw it was on _your_ side.--But see!'Indeed, it's on _my_ side,' the lad exclaimed.Then
the girl got angry: 'Ah, well, I wish I may never stir if I go with
you any longer!'"Then the thrush, too, left the lad; and he felt so dull that he
called out to the girl, 'Is the thrush with you?'--'No; isn't it with
you?'--'Ah, no; you must come here again, and then perhaps it will
follow you.'"The girl came; and she and the lad walked on together, hand in
hand.'Quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on the girl's side;
'quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on the lad's side; 'quitt,
quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on every side; and when they looked
there were a hundred thousand million thrushes all round them.said the girl, looking up at the lad.All the girls thought this was such a nice tale.Then Godfather said they must tell what they had dreamed last night,
and he would decide who had dreamed the nicest things.And then there was no end of tittering and whispering.But soon one
after another began to think she had such a nice dream last night;
and then others thought it could not possibly be so nice as what they
had dreamed; and at last they all got a great mind for telling their
dreams.Yet they must not be told aloud, but to one only, and that
one must by no means be Godfather.Arne had all this time been
sitting quietly a little lower down the hill, and so the girls
thought they dared tell their dreams to him.Then Arne seated himself under a hazel-bush; and Aasa, the girl who
had told the first tale, came over to him.She hesitated a while, but
then began,--

"I dreamed I was standing by a large lake.Then I saw one walking on
the water, and it was one whose name I will not say.He stepped into
a large water-lily, and sat there singing.But I launched out upon
one of the large leaves of the lily which lay floating on the water;
for on it I would row over to him.But no sooner had I come upon the
leaf than it began to sink with me, and I became much frightened, and
I wept.Then he came rowing along in the water-lily, and lifted me
up to him; and we rowed all over the whole lake.Next came the little girl who had told the tale about the little
lad,--

"I dreamed I had caught a little bird, and I was so pleased with it,
and I thought I wouldn't let it loose till I came home in our room.But there I dared not let it loose, for I was afraid father and
mother might tell me to let it go again.So I took it up-stairs; but
I could not let it loose there, either, for the cat was lurking
about.Then I didn't know what in the world to do; yet I took it into
the barn.Dear me, there were so many cracks, I was afraid it might
go away!Well, then I went down again into the yard; and there, it
seemed to me some one was standing whose name I will not say.He
stood playing with a big, big dog.'I would rather play with that
bird of yours,' he said, and drew very near to me.But then it seemed
to me I began running away; and both he and the big dog ran after me
all round the yard; but then mother opened the front door, pulled me
hastily in, and banged the door after me.The lad, however, stood
laughing outside, with his face against the window-pane.'Look,
here's the bird,' he said; and, only think, he had my bird out there!Then came the girl who had told about the thrushes--Eli, they called
her.She was laughing so much that she could not speak for some time;
but at last she began,--

"I had been looking forward with very much pleasure to our nutting in
the wood to-day; and so last night I dreamed I was sitting here on
the hill.The sun shone brightly; and I had my lap full of nuts.But
there came a little squirrel among them, and it sat on its hind-legs
and ate them all up.Afterwards some more dreams were told him; and then the girls would
have him say which was the nicest.Of course, he must have plenty of
time for consideration; and meanwhile Godfather and the whole flock
went down to the house, leaving Arne to follow.They skipped down the
hill, and when they came to the plain went all in a row singing
towards the house.Arne sat alone on the hill, listening to the singing.Strong sunlight
fell on the group of girls, and their white bodices shone bright, as
they went dancing over the meadows, every now and then clasping each
other round the waist; while Godfather limped behind, threatening
them with a stick because they trod down his hay.Arne thought no
more of the dreams, and soon he no longer looked after the girls.His
thoughts went floating far away beyond the valley, like the fine
air-threads, while he remained behind on the hill, spinning; and
before he was aware of it he had woven a close web of sadness.More
than ever, he longed to go away.he said to himself; "surely, I've been
lingering long enough now!"He promised himself that he would speak
to the mother about it as soon as he reached home, however it might
turn out.With greater force than ever, his thoughts turned to his song, "Over
the mountains high;" and never before had the words come so swiftly,
or linked themselves into rhyme so easily; they seemed almost like
girls sitting in a circle on the brow of a hill.He had a piece of
paper with him, and placing it upon his knee, he wrote down the
verses as they came.When he had finished the song, he rose like one
freed from a burden.He felt unwilling to see any one, and went
homewards by the way through the wood, though he knew he should then
have to walk during the night.The first time he stopped to rest on
the way, he put his hand to his pocket to take out the song,
intending to sing it aloud to himself through the wood; but he found
he had left it behind at the place where it was composed.One of the girls went on the hill to look for him; she did not find
him, but she found his song.X.

LOOSENING THE WEATHER-VANE.To speak to the mother about going away, was more easily thought of
than done.He spoke again about Christian, and those letters which
had never come; but then the mother went away, and for days
afterwards he thought her eyes looked red and swollen.He noticed,
too, that she then got nicer food for him than usual; and this gave
him another sign of her state of mind with regard to him.One day he went to cut fagots in a wood which bordered upon another
belonging to the parsonage, and through which the road ran.Just
where he was going to cut his fagots, people used to come in autumn
to gather whortleberries.He had laid aside his axe to take off his
jacket, and was just going to begin work, when two girls came walking
along with a basket to gather berries.He used generally to hide
himself rather than meet girls, and he did so now."Well, but, then, don't go any farther; here are many basketfuls.""I thought I heard a rustling among the trees!"The girls rushed towards each other, clasped each other round the
waist, and for a little while stood still, scarcely drawing breath."It's nothing, I dare say; come, let's go on picking.""It was nice you came to the parsonage to-day, Eli.Haven't you
anything to tell me?""Yes; I've been to see Godfather.""Well, you've told me that; but haven't you anything to tell me about
_him_--you know who?""Indeed, he has: father and mother pretended to know nothing of it;
but I went up-stairs and hid myself.""Yes; I believe father told him where I was; he's always so tiresome
now.""And so he came there?--Sit down, sit down; here, near me."Yes; but he didn't say much, for he was so bashful.""Tell me what he said, every word; pray, every word!"'You know what I want to say to you,' he said, sitting down
beside me on the chest.""I wished very much to get loose again; but he wouldn't let me.'Dear
Eli,' he said----" She laughed, and the other one laughed, too.And then both laughed together, "Ha, ha, ha, ha!"At last the laughing came to an end, and they were both quiet for a
while.Then the one who had first spoken asked in a low voice,
"Wasn't it strange he took you round your waist?"Either the other girl did not answer that question, or she answered
in so low a voice that it could not be heard; perhaps she only
answered by a smile."Didn't your father or your mother say anything afterwards?"asked
the first girl, after a pause."Father came up and looked at me; but I turned away from him because
he laughed at me.""No, she didn't say anything; but she wasn't so strict as usual.""Well, you've done with him, I think?""Was it thus he took you round your waist?""Well, then;--it was thus...."

"Eli?""Do you think there will ever be anybody come in that way to me?"Then they laughed again; and there was much whispering and tittering.Soon the girls went away; they had not seen either Arne or the axe
and jacket, and he was glad of it.A few days after, he gave Opplands-Knut a little farm on Kampen."You shall not be lonely any longer," Arne said.That winter Arne went to the parsonage for some time to do carpentry;
and both the girls were often there together.When Arne saw them, he
often wondered who it might be that now came to woo Eli Boeen.One day he had to drive for the clergyman's daughter and Eli; he
could not understand a word they said, though he had very quick ears.Sometimes Mathilde spoke to him; and then Eli always laughed and hid
her face.Mathilde asked him if it was true that he could make
verses."No," he said quickly; then they both laughed; and chattered
and laughed again.He felt vexed; and afterwards when he met them
seemed not to take any notice of them.Once he was sitting in the servants' hall while a dance was going on,
and Mathilde and Eli both came to see it.They stood together in a
corner, disputing about something; Eli would not do it, but Mathilde
would, and she at last gained her point.Then they both came over to
Arne, courtesied, and asked him if he could dance.He said he could
not; and then both turned aside and ran away, laughing.In fact, they
were always laughing, Arne thought; and he became brave.But soon
after, he got the clergyman's foster-son, a boy of about twelve, to
teach him to dance, when no one was by.Eli had a little brother of the same age as the clergyman's
foster-son.These two boys were playfellows; and Arne made sledges,
snow-shoes and snares for them; and often talked to them about their
sisters, especially about Eli.One day Eli's brother brought Arne a
message that he ought to make his hair a little smoother."Eli did; but she told me not to say it was she."A few days after, Arne sent word that Eli ought to laugh a little
less.The boy brought back word that Arne ought by all means to laugh
a little more.Eli's brother once asked Arne to give him something that he had
written.He complied, without thinking any more about the matter.But
in a few days after, the boy, thinking to please Arne, told him that
Eli and Mathilde liked his writing very much."Where, then, have they seen any of it?""Well, it was for them, I asked for some of it the other day."Then Arne asked the boys to bring him something their sisters had
written.They did so; and he corrected the errors in the writing with
his carpenter's pencil, and asked the boys to lay it in some place
where their sisters might easily find it.Soon after, he found the
paper in his jacket pocket; and at the foot was written, "Corrected
by a conceited fellow."The next day, Arne completed his work at the parsonage, and returned
home.So gentle as he was that winter, the mother had never seen him,
since that sad time just after the father's death.He read the sermon
to her, accompanied her to church, and was in every way very kind.But she knew only too well that one great reason for his increased
kindness was, that he meant to go away when spring came.Then one day
a message came from Boeen, asking him to go there to do carpentry.Arne started, and, apparently without thinking of what he said,
replied that he would come.But no sooner had the messenger left than
the mother said, "You may well be astonished!"Well, is there anything strange in that?"Arne asked, without
looking at her."And, why not from Boeen, as well as any other place?""From Boeen and Birgit Boeen!--Baard, who made your father a <DW36>,
and all only for Birgit's sake!"exclaimed Arne; "was that Baard Boeen?"The whole of the father's
life seemed unrolled before them, and at that moment they saw the
black thread which had always run through it.Then they began talking
about those grand days of his, when old Eli Boeen had himself offered
him his daughter Birgit, and he had refused her: they passed on
through his life till the day when his spine had been broken; and
they both agreed that Baard's fault was the less.Still, it was he
who had made the father a <DW36>; he, it was."Have I not even yet done with father?"Arne thought; and determined
at the same moment that he would go to Boeen.As he went walking, with his saw on his shoulder, over the ice
towards Boeen, it seemed to him a beautiful place.The dwelling-house
always seemed as if it was fresh painted; and--perhaps because he
felt a little cold--it just then looked to him very sheltered and
comfortable.He did not, however, go straight in, but went round by
the cattle-house, where a flock of thick-haired goats stood in the
snow, gnawing the bark off some fir twigs.A shepherd's dog ran
backwards and forwards on the barn steps, barking as if the devil was
coming to the house; but when Arne went to him, he wagged his tail
and allowed himself to be patted.The kitchen door at the upper end
of the house was often opened, and Arne looked over there every time;
but he saw no one except the milkmaid, carrying some pails, or the
cook, throwing something to the goats.In the barn the threshers
were hard at work; and to the left, in front of the woodshed, a lad
stood chopping fagots, with many piles of them behind him.Arne laid away his saw and went into the kitchen: the floor was
strewed with white sand and chopped juniper leaves; copper kettles
shone on the walls; china and earthenware stood in rows upon the
shelves; and the servants were preparing the dinner."Step into the sitting-room," said one of the servants,
pointing to an inner door with a brass knob.He went in: the room was
brightly painted--the ceiling, with clusters of roses; the cupboards,
with red, and the names of the owners in black letters; the bedstead,
also with red, bordered with blue stripes.Beside the stove, a
broad-shouldered, mild-looking man, with long light hair, sat hooping
some tubs; and at the large table, a slender, tall woman, in a
close-fitting dress and linen cap, sat sorting some corn into two
heaps: no one else was in the room."Good day, and a blessing on the work," said Arne, taking off his
cap.Both looked up; and the man smiled and asked who it was."I am
he who has come to do carpentry."The man smiled still more, and said, while he leaned forward again to
his work, "Oh, all right, Arne Kampen."exclaimed the wife, staring down at the floor.The man
looked up quickly, and said, smiling once more, "A son of Nils, the
tailor;" and then he began working again.Soon the wife rose, went to the shelf, turned from it to the
cupboard, once more turned away, and, while rummaging for something
in the table drawer, she asked, without looking up, "Is _he_ going to
work _here_?""Yes, that he is," the husband answered, also without looking up."Nobody has asked you to sit down, it seems," he added, turning to
Arne, who then took a seat.The wife went out, and the husband
continued working: and so Arne asked whether he, too, might begin.The wife did not return; but next time the door opened, it was Eli
who entered.At first, she appeared not to see Arne, but when he
rose to meet her she turned half round and gave him her hand; yet
she did not look at him.They exchanged a few words, while the
father worked on.Eli was slender and upright, her hands were small,
with round wrists, her hair was braided, and she wore a dress with a
close-fitting bodice.She laid the table for dinner: the laborers
dined in the next room; but Arne, with the family."No; she's up-stairs, weighing wool.""Yes; but she says she won't have anything.""She wouldn't let me make a fire."After dinner, Arne began to work; and in the evening he again sat
with the family.The wife and Eli sewed, while the husband employed
himself in some trifling work, and Arne helped him.They worked on in
silence above an hour; for Eli, who seemed to be the one who usually
did the talking, now said nothing.Arne thought with dismay how often
it was just so in his own home; and yet he had never felt it till
now.At last, Eli seemed to think she had been silent quite long
enough, and, after drawing a deep breath, she burst out laughing.Then the father laughed; and Arne felt it was ridiculous and began,
too.Afterwards they talked about several things, soon the
conversation was principally between Arne and Eli, the father now and
then putting in a word edgewise.But once after Arne had been
speaking at some length, he looked up, and his eyes met those of the
mother, Birgit, who had laid down her work, and sat gazing at him.Then she went on with her work again; but the next word he spoke made
her look up once more.Bedtime drew near, and they all went to their own rooms.Arne thought
he would take notice of the dream he had the first night in a fresh
place; but he could see no meaning in it.During the whole day he had
talked very little with the husband; yet now in the night he dreamed
of no one in the house but him.The last thing was, that Baard was
sitting playing at cards with Nils, the tailor.The latter looked
very pale and angry; but Baard was smiling, and he took all the
tricks.Arne stayed at Boeen several days; and a great deal was done, but very
little said.Not only the people in the parlor, but also the
servants, the housemen, everybody about the place, even the women,
were silent.In the yard was an old dog which barked whenever a
stranger came near; but if any of the people belonging to the place
heard him, they always said "Hush!"and then he went away, growling,
and lay down.At Arne's own home was a large weather-vane, and here
was one still larger which he particularly noticed because it did not
turn.It shook whenever the wind was high, as though it wished to
turn; and Arne stood looking at it so long that he felt at last he
must climb up to unloose it.It was not frozen fast, as he thought:
but a stick was fixed against it to prevent it from turning.He took
the stick out and threw it down; Baard was just passing below, and it
struck him."Leave it alone; it makes a wailing noise when it turns.""Well, I think even that's better than silence," said Arne, seating
himself astride on the ridge of the roof.Baard looked up at Arne,
and Arne down at Baard.Then Baard smiled and said, "He who must wail
when he speaks had better he silent."Words sometimes haunt us long after they were uttered, especially
when they were last words.So Baard's words followed Arne as he came
down from the roof in the cold, and they were still with him when he
went into the sitting-room in the evening.It was twilight; and Eli
stood at the window, looking away over the ice which lay bright in
the moonlight.Arne went to the other window, and looked out also.Indoors it was warm and quiet; outdoors it was cold, and a sharp wind
swept through the vale, bending the branches of the trees, and making
their shadows creep trembling on the snow.A light shone over from
the parsonage, then vanished, then appeared again, taking various
shapes and colors, as a distant light always seems to do when one
looks at it long and intently.Opposite, the mountain stood dark,
with deep shadow at its foot, where a thousand fairy tales hovered;
but with its snowy upper plains bright in the moonlight.The stars
were shining, and northern lights were flickering in one quarter of
the sky, but they did not spread.A little way from the window, down
towards the water, stood some trees, whose shadows kept stealing over
to each other; but the tall ash stood alone, writing on the snow.All was silent, save now and then, when a long wailing sound was
heard."It's the weather-vane," said Eli; and after a little while she added
in a lower tone, as if to herself, "it must have come unfastened."But Arne had been like one who wished to speak and could not.Now he
said, "Do you remember that tale about the thrushes?""It was you who told it, indeed."I often think there's something that sings when all is still," she
said, in a voice so soft and low that he felt as if he heard it now
for the first time."It is the good within our own souls," he said.She looked at him as if she thought that answer meant too much; and
they both stood silent a few moments.Then she asked, while she wrote
with her finger on the window-pane, "Have you made any songs lately?"He blushed; but she did not see it, and so she asked once more, "How
do you manage to make songs?""I store up the thoughts that other people let slip."She was silent for a long while; perhaps thinking she might have had
some thoughts fit for songs, but had let them slip."How strange it is," she said, at last, as though to herself, and
beginning to write again on the window-pane."I made a song the first time I had seen you.""Behind the parsonage, that evening you went away from there;--I saw
you in the water."She laughed, and was quiet for a while.Arne had never done such a thing before, but he repeated the song
now:

   "Fair Venevill bounded on lithesome feet
        Her lover to meet," &c.[4]

 [4] As on page 68.Eli listened attentively, and stood silent long after he had
finished.At last she exclaimed, "Ah, what a pity for her!""I feel as if I had not made that song myself," he said; and then
stood like her, thinking over it."But that won't be my fate, I hope," she said, after a pause."No; I was thinking rather of myself.""I don't know; I felt so then."The next day, when Arne came into the room to dinner, he went over to
the window.Outdoors it was dull and foggy, but indoors, warm and
comfortable; and on the window-pane was written with a finger, "Arne,
Arne, Arne," and nothing but "Arne," over and over again: it was at
that window, Eli stood the evening before.Next day, Arne came into the room and said he had heard in the yard
that the clergyman's daughter, Mathilde, had just gone to the town;
as she thought, for a few days, but as her parents intended, for a
year or two.Eli had heard nothing of this before, and now she fell
down fainting.Arne had never seen any one faint, and he was much
frightened.He ran for the maids; they ran for the parents, who came
hurrying in; and there was a disturbance all over the house, and the
dog barked on the barn steps.Soon after, when Arne came in again,
the mother was kneeling at the bedside, while the father supported
Eli's drooping head.The maids were running about--one for water,
another for hartshorn which was in the cupboard, while a third
unfastened her jacket.the mother said; "I see it was wrong in us not to
tell her; it was you, Baard, who would have it so; God help you!""I wished to tell her, indeed; but nothing's to
be as I wish; God help you!You're always so harsh with her, Baard;
you don't understand her; you don't know what it is to love anybody,
you don't.""She isn't like some others who can
bear sorrow; it quite puts her down, poor slight thing, as she is.Wake up, my child, and we'll be kind to you!wake up, Eli, my own
darling, and don't grieve us so.""You always either talk too much or too little," Baard said, at last,
looking over to Arne, as though he did not wish him to hear such
things, but to leave the room.As, however, the maid-servants stayed,
Arne thought he, too, might stay; but he went over to the window.Soon the sick girl revived so far as to be able to look round and
recognize those about her; but then also memory returned, and she
called wildly for Mathilde, went into hysterics, and sobbed till it
was painful to be in the room.The mother tried to soothe her, and
the father sat down where she could see him; but she pushed them both
from her.she cried; "I don't like you; go away!""Oh, Eli, how can you say you don't like your own parents?"you're unkind to me, and you take away every pleasure from me!"don't say such hard things," said the mother, imploringly."Yes, mother," she exclaimed; "now I _must_ say it!Yes, mother; you
wish to marry me to that bad man; and I won't have him!You shut me
up here, where I'm never happy save when I'm going out!And you take
away Mathilde from me; the only one in the world I love and long for!Oh, God, what will become of me, now Mathilde is gone!""But you haven't been much with her lately," Baard said."What did that matter, so long as I could look over to her from that
window," the poor girl answered, weeping in a childlike way that Arne
had never before seen in any one."Why, you couldn't see her there," said Baard."Still, I saw the house," she answered; and the mother added
passionately, "You don't understand such things, you don't.""Now, I can never again go to the window," said Eli."When I rose in
the morning, I went there; in the evening I sat there in the
moonlight: I went there when I could go to no one else.She writhed in the bed, and went again into hysterics.Baard sat down on a stool a little way from the bed, and continued
looking at her.But Eli did not recover so soon as they expected.Towards evening
they saw she would have a serious illness, which had probably been
coming upon her for some time; and Arne was called to assist in
carrying her up-stairs to her room.She lay quiet and unconscious,
looking very pale.The mother sat by the side of her bed, the father
stood at the foot, looking at her: afterwards he went to his work.So
did Arne; but that night before he went to sleep, he prayed for her;
prayed that she who was so young and fair might be happy in this
world, and that no one might bar away joy from her.The next day when Arne came in, he found the father and mother
sitting talking together: the mother had been weeping.Arne asked how
Eli was; both expected the other to give an answer, and so for some
time none was given, but at last the father said, "Well, she's very
bad to-day."Afterwards Arne heard that she had been raving all night, or, as the
father said, "talking foolery."She had a violent fever, knew no one,
and would not eat, and the parents were deliberating whether they
should send for a doctor.When afterwards they both went to the
sick-room, leaving Arne behind, he felt as if life and death were
struggling together up there, but he was kept outside.In a few days, however, Eli became a little better.But once when the
father was tending her, she took it into her head to have Narrifas,
the bird which Mathilde had given her, set beside the bed.Then Baard
told her that--as was really the case--in the confusion the bird had
been forgotten, and was starved.The mother was just coming in as
Baard was saying this, and while yet standing in the doorway, she
cried out, "Oh, dear me, what a monster you are, Baard, to tell it to
that poor little thing!See, she's fainting again; God forgive you!"When Eli revived she again asked for the bird; said its death was a
bad omen for Mathilde; and wished to go to her: then she fainted
again.Baard stood looking on till she grew so much worse that he
wanted to help, too, in tending her; but the mother pushed him away,
and said she would do all herself.Then Baard gave a long sad look at
both of them, put his cap straight with both hands, turned aside and
went out.Soon after, the Clergyman and his wife came; for the fever
heightened, and grew so violent that they did not know whether it
would turn to life or death.The Clergyman as well as his wife spoke
to Baard about Eli, and hinted that he was too harsh with her; but
when they heard what he had told her about the bird, the Clergyman
plainly told him it was very rough, and said he would have her taken
to his own house as soon as she was well enough to be moved.The
Clergyman's wife would scarcely look at Baard; she wept, and went to
sit with the sick one; then sent for the doctor, and came several
times a day to carry out his directions.Baard went wandering
restlessly about from one place to another in the yard, going
oftenest to those places where he could be alone.There he would
stand still by the hour together; then, put his cap straight and work
again a little.The mother did not speak to him, and they scarcely looked at each
other.He used to go and see Eli several times in the day; he took
off his shoes before he went up-stairs, left his cap outside, and
opened the door cautiously.When he came in, Birgit would turn her
head, but take no notice of him, and then sit just as before,
stooping forwards, with her head on her hands, looking at Eli, who
lay still and pale, unconscious of all that was passing around her.Baard would stand awhile at the foot of the bed and look at them
both, but say nothing: once when Eli moved as though she were waking,
he stole away directly as quietly as he had come.Arne often thought words had been exchanged between man and wife and
parents and child which had been long gathering, and would be long
remembered.He longed to go away, though he wished to know before he
went what would be the end of Eli's illness; but then he thought he
might always hear about her even after he had left; and so he went to
Baard telling him he wished to go home: the work which he came to do
was completed.Baard was sitting outdoors on a chopping-block,
scratching in the snow with a stick: Arne recognized the stick: it
was the one which had fastened the weather-vane."Well, perhaps it isn't worth your while to stay here now; yet I feel
as if I don't like you to go away, either," said Baard, without
looking up.He said no more; neither did Arne; but after a while he
walked away to do some work, taking for granted that he was to remain
at Boeen.Some time after, when he was called to dinner, he saw Baard still
sitting on the block.He went over to him, and asked how Eli was."I think she's very bad to-day," Baard said.Arne felt as if somebody asked him to sit down, and he seated himself
opposite Baard on the end of a felled tree."I've often thought of your father lately," Baard said so
unexpectedly that Arne did not know how to answer."You know, I suppose, what was between us?""Well, you know, as may be expected, only one half of the story, and
think I'm greatly to blame.""You have, I dare say, settled that affair with your God, as surely
as my father has done so," Arne said, after a pause."Well, some people might think so," Baard answered."When I found
this stick, I felt it was so strange that you should come here and
unloose the weather-vane.He had
taken off his cap, and sat silently looking at it."I was about fourteen years old when I became acquainted with your
father, and he was of the same age.He was very wild, and he couldn't
bear any one to be above him in anything.So he always had a grudge
against me because I stood first, and he, second, when we were
confirmed.He often offered to fight me, but we never came to it;
most likely because neither of us felt sure who would beat.And a
strange thing it is, that although he fought every day, no accident
came from it; while the first time I did, it turned out as badly as
could be; but, it's true, I had been wanting to fight long enough."Nils fluttered about all the girls, and they, about him.There was
only one I would have, and her he took away from me at every dance,
at every wedding, and at every party; it was she who is now my
wife.... Often, as I sat there, I felt a great mind to try my
strength upon him for this thing; but I was afraid I should lose, and
I knew if I did, I should lose her, too.Then, when everybody had
gone, I would lift the weights he had lifted, and kick the beam he
had kicked; but the next time he took the girl from me, I was afraid
to meddle with him, although once, when he was flirting with her just
in my face, I went up to a tall fellow who stood by and threw him
against the beam, as if in fun.And Nils grew pale, too, when he saw
it."Even if he had been kind to her; but he was false to her again and
again.I almost believe, too, she loved him all the more every time.I thought now it must either break or
bear.The Lord, too, would not have him going about any longer; and
so he fell a little more heavily than I meant him to do.They sat silent for a while; then Baard went on:

"I once more made my offer.She said neither yes nor no; but I
thought she would like me better afterwards.The
wedding was kept down in the valley, at the house of one of her
aunts, whose property she inherited.We had plenty when we started,
and it has now increased.Our estates lay side by side, and when we
married they were thrown into one, as I always, from a boy, thought
they might be.But many other things didn't turn out as I expected."He was silent for several minutes; and Arne thought he wept; but he
did not."In the beginning of our married life, she was quiet and very sad.I
had nothing to say to comfort her, and so I was silent.Afterwards,
she began sometimes to take to these fidgeting ways which you have, I
dare say, noticed in her; yet it was a change, and so I said nothing
then, either.But one really happy day, I haven't known ever since I
was married, and that's now twenty years...."

He broke the stick in two pieces; and then sat for a while looking at
them."When Eli grew bigger, I thought she would be happier among strangers
than at home.It was seldom I wished to carry out my own will in
anything, and whenever I did, it generally turned out badly; so it
was in this case.The mother longed after her child, though only the
lake lay between them; and afterwards I saw, too, that Eli's training
at the parsonage was in some ways not the right thing for her; but
then it was too late: now I think she likes neither father nor
mother."He had taken off his cap again; and now his long hair hung down over
his eyes; he stroked it back with both hands, and put on his cap as
if he were going away; but when, as he was about to rise, he turned
towards the house, he checked himself and added, while looking up at
the bed-room window."I thought it better that she and Mathilde shouldn't see each other
to say good-bye: that, too, was wrong.I told her the wee bird was
dead; for it was my fault, and so I thought it better to confess; but
that again was wrong.And so it is with everything: I've always meant
to do for the best, but it has always turned out for the worst; and
now things have come to such a pass that both wife and daughter speak
ill of me, and I'm going here lonely."A servant-girl called out to them that the dinner was becoming cold."I hear the horses neighing; I think somebody has
forgotten them," he said, and went away to the stable to give them
some hay.Arne rose, too; he felt as if he hardly knew whether Baard had been
speaking or not.The mother watched by her night
and day, and never came down-stairs; the father came up as usual,
with his boots off, and leaving his cap outside the door.Arne still
remained at the house.He and the father used to sit together in
the evening; and Arne began to like him much, for Baard was a
well-informed, deep-thinking man, though he seemed afraid of saying
what he knew.In his own way, he, too, enjoyed Arne's company, for
Arne helped his thoughts and told him of things which were new to
him.Eli soon began to sit up part of the day, and as she recovered, she
often took little fancies into her head.Thus, one evening when Arne
was sitting in the room below, singing songs in a clear, loud voice,
the mother came down with a message from Eli, asking him if he would
go up-stairs and sing to her, that she might also hear the words.It
seemed as if he had been singing to Eli all the time, for when the
mother spoke he turned red, and rose as if he would deny having done
so, though no one charged him with it.He soon collected himself,
however, and replied evasively, that he could sing so very little.The mother said it did not seem so when he was alone.He had not seen Eli since the day he helped to
carry her up-stairs; he thought she must be much altered, and he
felt half afraid to see her.But when he gently opened the door and
went in, he found the room quite dark, and he could see no one.He
stopped at the door-way.Eli asked in a clear, low voice."It's Arne Kampen," he said in a gentle, guarded tone, so that his
words might fall softly."It was very kind of you to come.""Won't you sit down, Arne?"she added after a while, and Arne felt
his way to a chair at the foot of the bed."It did me good to hear
you singing; won't you sing a little to me up here?""If I only knew anything you would like."She was silent a while: then she said, "Sing a hymn."And he sang
one: it was the confirmation hymn.When he had finished he heard her
weeping, and so he was afraid to sing again; but in a little while
she said, "Sing one more."And he sang another: it was the one which
is generally sung while the catechumens are standing in the aisle."How many things I've thought over while I've been lying here," Eli
said.He did not know what to answer; and he heard her weeping again
in the dark.A clock that was ticking on the wall warned for
striking, and then struck.Eli breathed deeply several times, as if
she would lighten her breast, and then she said, "One knows so
little; I knew neither father nor mother.I haven't been kind to
them; and now it seems so sad to hear that hymn."When we talk in the darkness, we speak more faithfully than when we
see each other's face; and we also say more."It does one good to hear you talk so," Arne replied, just
remembering what she had said when she was taken ill."If now this had not happened to me,"
she went on, "God only knows how long I might have gone before I
found mother.""She has talked matters over with you lately, then?""Yes, every day; she has done hardly anything else.""Then, I'm sure you've heard many things."They were silent; and Arne had thoughts which he could not utter.Eli
was the first to link their words again."You are said to be like your father.""People say so," he replied evasively.She did not notice the tone of his voice, and so, after a while she
returned to the subject."Sing a song to me... one that you've made yourself.""I have none," he said; for it was not his custom to confess he had
himself composed the songs he sang."I'm sure you have; and I'm sure, too, you'll sing one of them when I
ask you."What he had never done for any one else, he now did for her, as he
sang the following song,--

   "The Tree's early leaf-buds were bursting their brown:
    'Shall I take them away?''No; leave them alone
            Till the blossoms have grown,'
    Prayed the tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown."The Tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung:
    'Shall I take them away?''No; leave them alone
            Till the berries have grown,'
    Said the Tree, while his leaflets quivering hung."The Tree bore his fruit in the Midsummer glow:
    Said the girl, 'May I gather thy berries or no?''Yes; all thou canst see;
            Take them; all are for thee,'
    Said the Tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low."He, too, remained silent after
it, as though he had sung more than he could say.Darkness has a strong influence over those who are sitting in it and
dare not speak: they are never so near each other as then.If she
only turned on the pillow, or moved her hand on the blanket, or
breathed a little more heavily, he heard it."Arne, couldn't you teach me to make songs?""Yes, I have, these last few days; but I can't manage it.""What, then, did you wish to have in them?""Something about my mother, who loved your father so dearly.""Yes, indeed it is; and I have wept over it.""You shouldn't search for subjects; they come of themselves.""Just as other dear things come--unexpectedly.""I wonder, Arne, you're longing to go away;
you who have such a world of beauty within yourself.""Do _you_ know I am longing?"She did not answer, but lay still a few moments as if in thought."Arne, you mustn't go away," she said; and the words came warm to his
heart."Well, sometimes I have less mind to go.""Your mother must love you much, I'm sure."Go over to Kampen, when you're well again."And all at once, he fancied her sitting in the bright room at Kampen,
looking out on the mountains; his chest began to heave, and the blood
rushed to his face."It's warm in here," he said, rising."You must come over to see us oftener; mother's so fond of you.""I should like to come myself, too;... but still I must have some
errand."Eli lay silent for a while, as if she was turning over something in
her mind."I believe," she said, "mother has something to ask you
about."...

They both felt the room was becoming very hot; he wiped his brow, and
he heard her rise in the bed.No sound could be heard either in the
room or down-stairs, save the ticking of the clock on the wall.There
was no moon, and the darkness was deep; when he looked through the
green window, it seemed to him as if he was looking into a wood; when
he looked towards Eli he could see nothing, but his thoughts went
over to her, and then his heart throbbed till he could himself hear
its beating.Before his eyes flickered bright sparks; in his ears
came a rushing sound; still faster throbbed his heart: he felt he
must rise or say something.But then she exclaimed,

"How I wish it were summer!"And he heard again the sound of the
cattle-bells, the horn from the mountains, and the singing from the
valleys; and saw the fresh green foliage, the Swart-water glittering
in the sunbeams, the houses rocking in it, and Eli coming out and
sitting on the shore, just as she did that evening."If it were
summer," she said, "and I were sitting on the hill, I think I could
sing a song."He smiled gladly, and asked, "What would it be about?""About something bright; about--well, I hardly know what myself."He rose in glad excitement; but, on second thoughts,
sat down again."I sang to you when you asked me.""Yes, I know you did; but I can't tell you this; no!"Eli, do you think I would laugh at the little verse you have made?""No, I don't think you would, Arne; but it isn't anything I've made
myself.""Oh, it's by somebody else then?""Then, you can surely say it to me.""No, no, I can't; don't ask me again, Arne!"The last words were almost inaudible; it seemed as if she had hidden
her head under the bedclothes."Eli, now you're not kind to me as I was to you," he said, rising."But, Arne, there's a difference... you don't understand me... but
it was... I don't know... another time... don't be offended with
me, Arne!Though he asked, he did not believe she was.She still wept; he
felt he must draw nearer or go quite away.But he did not know what to say more, and
was silent."It's something--"

His voice trembled, and he stopped."You mustn't refuse... I would ask you...."

"Is it the song?""No... Eli, I wish so much...." He heard her breathing fast and
deeply... "I wish so much... to hold one of your hands."She did not answer; he listened intently--drew nearer, and clasped a
warm little hand which lay on the coverlet.Then steps were heard coming up-stairs; they came nearer and nearer;
the door was opened; and Arne unclasped his hand.It was the mother,
who came in with a light."I think you're sitting too long in the
dark," she said, putting the candlestick on the table.But neither
Eli nor Arne could bear the light; she turned her face to the pillow,
and he shaded his eyes with his hand."Well, it pains a little at
first, but it soon passes off," said the mother.Arne looked on the floor for something which he had not dropped, and
then went down-stairs.The next day, he heard that Eli intended to come down in the
afternoon.He put his tools together, and said good-bye.When she
came down he had gone.MARGIT CONSULTS THE CLERGYMAN.Up between the mountains, the spring comes late.The post, who in
winter passes along the high-road thrice a week, in April passes only
once; and the highlanders know then that outside, the snow is
shovelled away, the ice broken, the steamers are running, and the
plough is struck into the earth.Here, the snow still lies six feet
deep; the cattle low in their stalls; the birds arrive, but feel cold
and hide themselves.Occasionally some traveller arrives, saying he
has left his carriage down in the valley; he brings flowers, which he
examines; he picked them by the wayside.The people watch the advance
of the season, talk over their matters, and look up at the sun and
round about, to see how much he is able to do each day.They scatter
ashes on the snow, and think of those who are now picking flowers.It was at this time of year, old Margit Kampen went one day to the
parsonage, and asked whether she might speak to "father."She was
invited into the study, where the clergyman,--a slender, fair-haired,
gentle-looking man, with large eyes and spectacles,--received her
kindly, recognized her, and asked her to sit down."Is there something the matter with Arne again?"he inquired, as if
Arne had often been a subject of conversation between them.I haven't anything wrong to say about him; but yet
it's so sad," said Margit, looking deeply grieved.I can hardly think he'll even stay with me till
spring comes up here.""But he has promised never to go away from you.""That's true; but, dear me!he must now be his own master; and if his
mind's set upon going away, go, he must."Well, after all, I don't think he will leave you.""Well, perhaps not; but still, if he isn't happy at home?am I then
to have it upon my conscience that I stand in his way?Sometimes I
feel as if I ought even to ask him to leave.""How do you know he is longing now, more than ever?"Since the middle of the winter, he hasn't
worked out in the parish a single day; but he has been to the town
three times, and has stayed a long while each time.He scarcely ever
talks now while he is at work, but he often used to do.He'll sit for
hours alone at the little up-stairs window, looking towards the
ravine, and away over the mountains; he'll sit there all Sunday
afternoon, and often when it's moonlight he sits there till late in
the night.""Yes, of course, he reads and sings to me every Sunday; but he seems
rather in a hurry, save now and then when he gives almost too much of
the thing.""Does he never talk over matters with you then?""Well, yes; but it's so seldom that I sit and weep alone between
whiles.Then I dare say he notices it, for he begins talking, but
it's only about trifles; never about anything serious."The Clergyman walked up and down the room; then he stopped and asked,
"But why, then, don't you talk to him about his matters?"For a long while she gave no answer; she sighed several times, looked
downwards and sideways, doubled up her handkerchief, and at last
said, "I've come here to speak to you, father, about something that's
a great burden on my mind.""Speak freely; it will relieve you.""Yes, I know it will; for I've borne it alone now these many years,
and it grows heavier each year.""Well, what is it, my good Margit?"There was a pause, and then she said, "I've greatly sinned against my
son."The Clergyman came close to her; "Confess it," he
said; "and we will pray together that it may be forgiven."Margit sobbed and wiped her eyes, but began weeping again when she
tried to speak.The Clergyman tried to comfort her, saying she could
not have done anything very sinful, she doubtless was too hard upon
herself, and so on.But Margit continued weeping, and could not begin
her confession till the Clergyman seated himself by her side, and
spoke still more encouragingly to her.Then after a while she began,
"The boy was ill-used when a child; and so he got this mind for
travelling.Then he met with Christian--he who has grown so rich over
there where they dig gold.Christian gave him so many books that he
got quite a scholar; they used to sit together in the long evenings;
and when Christian went away Arne wanted to go after him.But just at
that time, the father died, and the lad promised never to leave me.But I was like a hen that's got a duck's egg to brood; when my
duckling had burst his shell, he would go out on the wide water, and
I was left on the bank, calling after him.If he didn't go away
himself, yet his heart went away in his songs, and every morning I
expected to find his bed empty."Then a letter from foreign parts came for him, and I felt sure it
must be from Christian.God forgive me, but I kept it back!I thought
there would be no more, but another came; and, as I had kept the
first, I thought I must keep the second, too.it seemed
as if they would burn a hole through the box where I had put them;
and my thoughts were there from as soon as I opened my eyes in the
morning till late at night when I shut them.And then,--did you ever
hear of anything worse!--a third letter came.I held it in my hand a
quarter of an hour; I kept it in my bosom three days, weighing in my
mind whether I should give it to him or put it with the others; but
then I thought perhaps it would lure him away from me, and so I
couldn't help putting it with the others.But now I felt miserable
every day, not only about the letters in the box, but also for fear
another might come.I was afraid of everybody who came to the house;
when we were sitting together inside, I trembled whenever I heard the
door go, for fear it might be somebody with a letter, and then he
might get it.When he was away in the parish, I went about at home
thinking he might perhaps get a letter while there, and then it would
tell him about those that had already come.When I saw him coming
home, I used to look at his face while he was yet a long way off,
and, oh, dear!how happy I felt when he smiled; for then I knew he
had got no letter.He had grown so handsome; like his father, only
fairer, and more gentle-looking.And, then, he had such a voice; when
he sat at the door in the evening-sun, singing towards the mountain
ridge, and listening to the echo, I felt that live without him.If I only saw him, or knew he was somewhere near, and he
seemed pretty happy, and would only give me a word now and then, I
wanted nothing more on earth, and I wouldn't have shed one tear
less."But just when he seemed to be getting on better with people, and
felt happier among them, there came a message from the post-office
that a fourth letter had come; and in it were two hundred dollars!I
thought I should have fell flat down where I stood: what could I do?The letter, I might get rid of, 'twas true; but the money?For two or
three nights I couldn't sleep for it; a little while I left it
up-stairs, then, in the cellar behind a barrel, and once I was so
overdone that I laid it in the window so that he might find it.But
when I heard him coming, I took it back again.At last, however, I
found a way: I gave him the money and told him it had been put out at
interest in my mother's lifetime.He laid it out upon the land, just
as I thought he would; and so it wasn't wasted.But that same
harvest-time, when he was sitting at home one evening, he began
talking about Christian, and wondering why he had so clean forgotten
him."Now again the wound opened, and the money burned me so that I was
obliged to go out of the room.I had sinned, and yet my sin had
answered no end.Since then, I have hardly dared to look into his
eyes, blessed as they are."The mother who has sinned against her own child is the most
miserable of all mothers;... and yet I did it only out of love....
And so, I dare say, I shall be punished accordingly by the loss of
what I love most.For since the middle of the winter, he has again
taken to singing the tune that he used to sing when he was longing to
go away; he has sung it ever since he was a lad, and whenever I hear
it I grow pale.Then I feel I could give up all for him; and only see
this."She took from her bosom a piece of paper, unfolded it and gave
it to the Clergyman."He now and then writes something here; I think
it's some words to that tune.... I brought it with me; for I can't
myself read such small writing... will you look and see if there
isn't something written about his going away...."

There was only one whole verse on the paper.For the second verse,
there were only a few half-finished lines, as if the song was one he
had forgotten, and was now coming into his memory again, line by
line.The first verse ran thus,--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
        Over the mountains high?Now I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine trees grow,
        Waiting and longing to rise
        Nearer the beckoning skies.""Yes, it is about that," replied the Clergyman, putting the paper
down.She sat with folded
hands, looking intently and anxiously into the Clergyman's face,
while tear after tear fell down her cheeks.The Clergyman knew no more what to do in the matter than she did."Well, I think the lad must be left alone in this case," he said."Life can't be made different for his sake; but what he will find in
it must depend upon himself; now, it seems, he wishes to go away in
search of life's good.""But isn't that just what the old crone did?""Yes; she who went away to fetch the sunshine, instead of making
windows in the wall to let it in."The Clergyman was much astonished at Margit's words, and so he had
been before, when she came speak to him on this subject; but,
indeed, she had thought of hardly anything else for eight years."Well, as to the letters, that wasn't quite right.Keeping back what
belonged to your son, can't be justified.But it was still worse to
make a fellow Christian appear in a bad light when he didn't deserve
it; and especially as he was one whom Arne was so fond of, and who
loved him so dearly in return.But we will pray God to forgive you;
we will both pray."Margit still sat with her hands folded, and her head bent down."How I should pray him to forgive me, if I only knew he would stay!"she said: surely, she was confounding our Lord with Arne.The
Clergyman, however, appeared as if he did not notice it."Do you intend to confess it to him directly?"She looked down, and said in a low voice, "I should much like to wait
a little if I dared."The Clergyman turned aside with a smile, and asked, "Don't you
believe your sin becomes greater, the longer you delay confessing
it?"She pulled her handkerchief about with both hands, folded it into a
very small square, and tried to fold it into a still smaller one, but
could not."If I confess about the letters, I'm afraid he'll go away.""Then, you dare not rely upon our Lord?""Oh, yes, I do, indeed," she said hurriedly; and then she added in a
low voice, "but still, if he were to go away from me?""Then, I see you are more afraid of his going away than of continuing
to sin?"Margit had unfolded her handkerchief again; and now she put it to her
eyes, for she began weeping.The Clergyman remained for a while
looking at her silently; then he went on, "Why, then, did you tell me
all this, if it was not to lead to anything?"He waited long, but she
did not answer."Perhaps you thought your sin would become less when
you had confessed it?""Yes, I did," she said, almost in a whisper, while her head bent
still lower upon her breast."Well, well, my good Margit, take
courage; I hope all will yet turn out for the best."she asked, looking up; and a sad smile passed over
her tear-marked face."Yes, I do; I believe God will no longer try you.You will have joy
in your old age, I am sure.""If I might only keep the joy I have!"she said; and the Clergyman
thought she seemed unable to fancy any greater happiness than living
in that constant anxiety."If we had but a little girl, now, who could take hold on him, then
I'm sure he would stay.""You may be sure I've thought of that," she said, shaking her head."Well, there's Eli Boeen; she might be one who would please him.""You may be sure I've thought of that."She rocked the upper part of
her body backwards and forwards."If we could contrive that they might oftener see each other here at
the parsonage?""You may be sure I've thought of that!"She clapped her hands and
looked at the Clergyman with a smile all over her face.He stopped
while he was lighting his pipe."Perhaps this, after all, was what brought you here to-day?"She looked down, put two fingers into the folded handkerchief, and
pulled out one corner of it."Ah, well, God help me, perhaps it was this I wanted."The Clergyman walked up and down, and smiled."Perhaps, too, you came
for the same thing the last time you were here?"She pulled out the corner of the handkerchief still farther, and
hesitated awhile."Well, as you ask me, perhaps I did--yes.""Then, too, it was to carry this point
that you confessed at last the thing you had on your conscience."She spread out the handkerchief to fold it up smoothly again."No;
ah, no; that weighed so heavily upon me, I felt I must tell it to
you, father.""Well, well, my dear Margit, we will talk no more about it."Then, while he was walking up and down, he suddenly added, "Do you
think you would of yourself have come out to me with this wish of
yours?""Well,--I had already come out with so much, that I dare say this,
too, would have come out at last."The Clergyman laughed, but he did not tell her what he thought."Well, we will manage this matter for you,
Margit," he said.She rose to go, for she understood he had now
said all he wished to say."And we will look after them a little.""I don't know how to thank you enough," she said, taking his hand and
courtesying.She wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, went towards the door,
courtesied again, and said, "Good bye," while she slowly opened and
shut it.But so lightly as she went towards Kampen that day, she had
not gone for many, many years.When she had come far enough to see
the thick smoke curling up cheerfully from the chimney, she blessed
the house, the whole place, the Clergyman and Arne,--and remembered
they were going to have her favorite dish, smoked ham, for dinner.It was situated in the middle of a
plain, bordered on the one side by a ravine, and on the other, by the
high-road; just beyond the road was a thick wood, with a mountain
ridge rising behind it, while high above all stood blue mountains
crowned with snow.On the other side of the ravine also was a wide
range of mountains, running round the Swart-water on the side where
Boeen was situated: it grew higher as it ran towards Kampen, but then
turned suddenly sidewards, forming the broad valley called the
Lower-tract, which began here, for Kampen was the last place in the
Upper-tract.The front door of the dwelling-house opened towards the road, which
was about two thousand paces off, and a path with leafy birch-trees
on both sides led thither.In front of the house was a little garden,
which Arne managed according to the rules given in his books.The
cattle-houses and barns were nearly all new-built, and stood to the
left hand, forming a square.The house was two stories high, and was
painted red, with white window-frames and doors; the roof was of turf
with many small plants growing upon it, and on the ridge was a
vane-spindle, where turned an iron cock with a high raised tail.Spring had come to the mountain-tracts.It was Sunday morning; the
weather was mild and calm, but the air was somewhat heavy, and the
mist lay low on the forest, though Margit said it would rise later in
the day.Arne had read the sermon, and sung the hymns to his mother,
and he felt better for them himself.Now he stood ready dressed to go
to the parsonage.When he opened the door the fresh smell of the
leaves met him; the garden lay dewy and bright in the morning breeze,
but from the ravine sounded the roaring of the waterfall, now in
lower, then again in louder booms, till all around seemed to tremble.As he went farther from the fall, its booming
became less awful, and soon it lay over the landscape like the deep
tones of an organ.the mother said, opening the
window and looking after him till he disappeared behind the shrubs.The mist had gradually risen, the sun shone bright, the fields and
garden became full of fresh life, and the things Arne had sown and
tended grew and sent up odor and gladness to his mother."Spring is
beautiful to those who have had a long winter," she said, looking
away over the fields, as if in thought.Arne had no positive errand at the parsonage, but he thought he might
go there to ask about the newspapers which he shared with the
Clergyman.Recently he had read the names of several Norwegians who
had been successful in gold digging in America, and among them was
Christian.His relations had long since left the place, but Arne had
lately heard a rumor that they expected him to come home soon.About
this, also, Arne thought he might hear at the parsonage; and if
Christian had already returned, he would go down and see him between
spring and hay-harvest.These thoughts occupied his mind till he came
far enough to see the Swart-water and Boeen on the other side.There,
too, the mist had risen, but it lay lingering on the mountain-sides,
while their peaks rose clear above, and the sunbeams played on the
plain; on the right hand, the shadow of the wood darkened the water,
but before the houses the lake had strewed its white sand on the flat
shore.All at once, Arne fancied himself in the red-painted house
with the white doors and windows, which he had taken as a model for
his own.He did not think of those first gloomy days he had passed
there, but only of that summer they both saw--he and Eli--up beside
her sick-bed.He had not been there since; nor would he have gone for
the whole world.If his thoughts but touched on that time, he turned
crimson; yet he thought of it many times a day; and if anything could
have driven him away from the parish, it was this.He strode onwards, as if to flee from his thoughts; but the farther
he went, the nearer he came to Boeen, and the more he looked at it.The mist had disappeared, the sky shone bright between the frame of
mountains, the birds floated in the sunny air, calling to each other,
and the fields laughed with millions of flowers; here no thundering
waterfall bowed the gladness to submissive awe, but full of life it
gambolled and sang without check or pause.Arne walked till he became glowing hot; then he threw himself down on
the grass beneath the shadow of a hill and looked towards Boeen, but
he soon turned away again to avoid seeing it.Then he heard a song
above him, so wonderfully clear as he had never heard a song before.It came floating over the meadows, mingled with the chattering of the
birds, and he had scarcely recognized the tune ere he recognized the
words also: the tune was the one he loved better than any; the words
were those he had borne in his mind ever since he was a boy, and had
forgotten that same day they were brought forth.He sprang up as if
he would catch them, but then stopped and listened while verse after
verse came streaming down to him:--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
      Over the mountains high?Now, I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine-trees grow,
      Waiting and longing to rise
      Nearer the beckoning skies."Th' eagle is rising afar away,
      Over the mountains high,
    Rowing along in the radiant day
    With mighty strokes to his distant prey,
      Where he will, swooping downwards,
      Where he will, sailing onwards."Apple-tree, longest thou not to go
      Over the mountains high?Gladly thou growest in summer's glow,
    Patiently waitest through winter's snow:
      Though birds on thy branches swing,
      Thou knowest not what they sing."He who has twenty years longed to flee
      Over the mountains high--
    He who beyond them, never will see,
    Smaller, and smaller, each year must be:
      He hears what the birds, say
      While on thy boughs they play."Birds, with your chattering, why did ye come
      Over the mountains high?Beyond, in a sunnier land ye could roam,
    And nearer to heaven could build your home;
      Why have ye come to bring
      Longing, without your wing?"Shall I, then, never, never flee
      Over the mountains high?Rocky walls, will ye always be
    Prisons until ye are tombs for me?--
      Until I lie at your feet
      Wrapped in my winding-sheet?I will away, afar away,
      Over the mountains high!Here, I am sinking lower each day,
    Though my Spirit has chosen the loftiest way;
      Let her in freedom fly;
      Not, beat on the walls and die!"_Once_, I know, I shall journey far
      Over the mountains high.Lord, is thy door already ajar?--
    Dear is the home where thy saved ones are;--
      But bar it awhile from me,
      And help me to long for Thee."Arne stood listening till the sound of the last verse, the last words
died away; then he heard the birds sing and play again, but he dared
not move.Yet he must find out who had been singing, and he lifted
his foot and walked on, so carefully that he did not hear the grass
rustle.A little butterfly settled on a flower at his feet, flew up
and settled a little way before him, flew up and settled again, and
so on all over the hill.But soon he came to a thick bush and
stopped; for a bird flew out of it with a frightened "quitt, quitt!"and rushed away over the sloping hill-side.Then she who was sitting
there looked up; Arne stooped low down, his heart throbbed till he
heard its beats, he held his breath, and was afraid to stir a leaf;
for it was Eli whom he saw.After a long while he ventured to look up again; he wished to draw
nearer, but he thought the bird perhaps had its nest under the bush,
and he was afraid he might tread on it.Then he peeped between the
leaves as they blew aside and closed again.She wore a close-fitting black dress with long white sleeves,
and a straw hat like those worn by boys.In her lap a book was lying
with a heap of wild flowers upon it; her right hand was listlessly
playing with them as if she were in thought, and her left supported
her head.She was looking away towards the place where the bird had
flown, and she seemed as if she had been weeping.Anything more beautiful, Arne had never seen or dreamed of in all
his life; the sun, too, had spread its gold over her and the place;
and the song still hovered round her, so that Arne thought,
breathed--nay, even his heart beat, in time with it.It seemed so
strange that the song which bore all his longing, _he_ had forgotten,
but _she_ had found.A tawny wasp flew round her in circles many times, till at last she
saw it and frightened it away with a flower-stalk, which she put up
as often as it came before her.Then she took up the book and opened
it, but she soon closed it again, sat as before, and began to hum
another song.He could hear it was "The Tree's early leaf-buds,"
though she often made mistakes, as if she did not quite remember
either the words or the tune.The verse she knew best was the last
one, and so she often repeated it; but she sang it thus:--

   "The Tree bore his berries, so mellow and red:
    'May I gather thy berries?''Yes; all thou canst see;
        Take them; all are for thee.'Said the Tree--trala--lala, trala, lala--said."Then she suddenly sprang up, scattering all the flowers around her,
and sang till the tune trembled through the air, and might have been
heard at Boeen.Arne had thought of coming forwards when she began
singing; he was just about to do so when she jumped up; then he felt
he _must_ come, but she went away.No!--There she skipped over the hillocks singing; here her hat fell
off, there she took it up again; here she picked a flower, there she
stood deep in the highest grass.It was a long while ere he ventured to peep out
again; at first he only raised his head; he could not see her: he
rose to his knees; still he could not see her: he stood upright; no
she was gone.He thought himself a miserable fellow; and some of the
tales he had heard at the nutting-party came into his mind.Now he would not go to the parsonage.He would not have the
newspapers; would not know anything about Christian.He would not go
home; he would go nowhere; he would do nothing."Oh, God, I am so unhappy!"He sprang up again and sang "The Tree's early leaf-buds" till the
mountains resounded.Then he sat down where she had been sitting, and took up the flowers
she had picked, but he flung them away again down the hill on every
side.It was long since he had done so; this struck
him, and made him weep still more.He would go far away, that he
would; no, he would not go away!He thought he was very unhappy; but
when he asked himself why, he could hardly tell.It
was a lovely day; and the Sabbath rest lay over all.The lake was
without a ripple; from the houses the curling smoke had begun to
rise; the partridges one after another had ceased calling, and though
the little birds continued their twittering, they went towards the
shade of the wood; the dewdrops were gone, and the grass looked
grave; not a breath of wind stirred the drooping leaves; and the sun
was near the meridian.Almost before he knew, he found himself seated
putting together a little song; a sweet tune offered itself for it;
and while his heart was strangely full of gentle feelings, the tune
went and came till words linked themselves to it and begged to be
sung, if only for once.He sang them gently, sitting where Eli had sat:

   "He went in the forest the whole day long,
    The whole day long;
    For there he had heard such a wondrous song,
    A wondrous song."He fashioned a flute from a willow spray,
    A willow spray,
    To see if within it the sweet tune lay,
    The sweet tune lay."It whispered and told him its name at last,
    Its name at last;
    But then, while he listened, away it passed,
    Away it passed."But oft when he slumbered, again it stole,
    Again it stole,
    With touches of love upon his soul,
    Upon his soul."Then he tried to catch it, and keep it fast,
    And keep it fast;
    But he woke, and away i' the night it passed,
    I' the night it passed."'My Lord, let me pass in the night, I pray,
    In the night, I pray;
    For the tune has taken my heart away,
    My heart away.'"Then answered the Lord, 'It is thy friend,
    It is thy friend,
    Though not for an hour shall thy longing end,
    Thy longing end;

   "'And all the others are nothing to thee,
    Nothing to thee,
    To this that thou seekest and never shalt see,
    Never shalt see.'"SOMEBODY'S FUTURE HOME."Good bye," said Margit at the Clergyman's door.It was a Sunday
evening in advancing summer-time; the Clergyman had returned from
church, and Margit had been sitting with him till now, when it was
seven o'clock."Good bye, Margit," said the Clergyman.She hurried
down the door-steps and into the yard; for she had seen Eli Boeen
playing there with her brother and the Clergyman's son."Good evening," said Margit, stopping; "and God bless you all."She blushed crimson and wanted to leave
off the game; the boys begged her to keep on, but she persuaded them
to let her go for that evening."I almost think I know you," said Margit.you're Eli Boeen; yes, now I see you're like your mother."Eli's auburn hair had come unfastened, and hung down over her neck
and shoulders; she was hot and as red as a cherry, her bosom
fluttered up and down, and she could scarcely speak, but laughed
because she was so out of breath."Well, young folks should be merry," said Margit, feeling happy as
she looked at her."P'r'aps you don't know me?"If Margit had not been her senior, Eli would probably have asked her
name, but now she only said she did not remember having seen her
before."No; I dare say not: old folks don't go out much.But my son, p'r'aps
you know a little--Arne Kampen; I'm his mother," said Margit, with a
stolen glance at Eli, who suddenly looked grave and breathed slowly."I'm pretty sure he worked at Boeen once.""It's a fine evening; we turned our hay this morning, and got it in
before I came away; it's good weather indeed for everything.""There will be a good hay-harvest this year," Eli suggested."Yes, you may well say that; everything's getting on well at Boeen, I
suppose?""Oh, yes, I dare say you have; your folks work well, and they have
plenty of help."Couldn't you go a little way with me?I so seldom have anybody to
talk to; and it will be all the same to you, I suppose?"Eli excused herself, saying she had not her jacket on."Well, it's a shame to ask such a thing the first time of seeing
anybody; but one must put up with old folks' ways."Eli said she would go; she would only fetch her jacket first.It was a close-fitting jacket, which when fastened looked like a
dress with a bodice; but now she fastened only two of the lower
hooks, because she was so hot.Her fine linen bodice had a little
turned-down collar, and was fastened with a silver stud in the shape
of a bird with spread wings.Just such a one, Nils, the tailor, wore
the first time Margit danced with him."A pretty stud," she said, looking at it."Ah, I thought so," Margit said, helping her with the jacket.The hay was lying in heaps; and
Margit took up a handful, smelled it, and thought it was very good.She asked about the cattle at the parsonage, and this led her to ask
also about the live stock at Boeen, and then she told how much they
had at Kampen."The farm has improved very much these last few years,
and it can still be made twice as large.He keeps twelve milch-cows
now, and he could keep several more, but he reads so many books and
manages according to them, and so he will have the cows fed in such a
first-rate way."Eli, as might be expected, said nothing to all this; and Margit then
asked her age."Have you helped in the house-work?Not much, I dare say--you look so
spruce."Yes, she had helped a good deal, especially of late."Well, it's best to use one's self to do a little of everything; when
one gets a large house of one's own, there's a great deal to be done.But, of course, when one finds good help already in the house before
her, why, it doesn't matter so much."Now Eli thought she must go back; for they had gone a long way beyond
the grounds of the parsonage."It still wants some hours to sunset; it would be kind it you would
chat a little longer with me."Then Margit began to talk about Arne."I don't know if you know much
of him.He could teach you something about everything, he could; dear
me, what a deal he has read!"Eli owned she knew he had read a great deal."Yes; and that's only the least thing that can be said of him; but
the way he has behaved to his mother all his days, that's something
more, that is.If the old saying is true, that he who's good to his
mother is good to his wife, the one Arne chooses won't have much to
complain of."Eli asked why they had painted the house before them with grey paint."Ah, I suppose they had no other; I only wish Arne may sometime be
rewarded for all his kindness to his mother.When he has a wife, she
ought to be kind-hearted as well as a good scholar."I only dropped a little twig I had."I think of a many things, you may be sure, while I sit
alone in yonder wood.If ever he takes home a wife who brings
blessings to house and man, then I know many a poor soul will be glad
that day."They were both silent, and walked on without looking at each other;
but soon Eli stopped."One of my shoe-strings has come down."Margit waited a long while till at last the string was tied."He has such queer ways," she began again; "he got cowed while he was
a child, and so he has got into the way of thinking over everything
by himself, and those sort of folks haven't courage to come forward."Now Eli must indeed go back, but Margit said that
Kampen was only half a mile off; indeed, not so far, and that Eli
must see it, as too she was so near.But Eli thought it would be late
that day."There'll be sure to be somebody to bring you home.""No, no," Eli answered quickly, and would go back."Arne's not at home, it's true," said Margit; "but there's sure to be
somebody else about;" and Eli had now less objection to it."If only I shall not be too late," she said."Yes, if we stand here much longer talking about it, it may be too
late, I dare say.""Being brought up at the
Clergyman's, you've read a great deal, I dare say?""It'll be of good use when you have a husband who knows less."No; that, Eli thought she would never have."Well, no; p'r'aps, after all, it isn't the best thing; but still
folks about here haven't much learning."Eli asked if it was Kampen, she could see straight before her."No; that's Gransetren, the next place to the wood; when we come
farther up you'll see Kampen.It's a pleasant place to live at, is
Kampen, you may be sure; it seems a little out of the way, it's true;
but that doesn't matter much, after all."Eli asked what made the smoke that rose from the wood."It comes from a houseman's cottage, belonging to Kampen: a man named
Opplands-Knut lives there.He went about lonely till Arne gave him
that piece of land to clear.he knows what it is to be
lonely."Soon they came far enough to see Kampen."Yes, it is," said the mother; and she, too, stood still.The sun
shone full in their faces, and they shaded their eyes as they looked
down over the plain.In the middle of it stood the red-painted house
with its white window-frames; rich green cornfields lay between the
pale new-mown meadows, where some of the hay was already set in
stacks; near the cow-house, all was life and stir; the cows, sheep
and goats were coming home; their bells tinkled, the dogs barked, and
the milkmaids called; while high above all, rose the grand tune of
the waterfall from the ravine.The farther Eli went, the more this
filled her ears, till at last it seemed quite awful to her; it
whizzed and roared through her head, her heart throbbed violently,
and she became bewildered and dizzy, and then felt so subdued that
she unconsciously began to walk with such small timid steps that
Margit begged her to come on a little faster."I never
heard anything like that fall," she said; "I'm quite frightened.""You'll soon get used to it; and at last you'll even miss it.""Come, now, we'll first look at the cattle," she said, turning
downwards from the road, into the path."Those trees on each side,
Nils planted; he wanted to have everything nice, did Nils; and so
does Arne; look, there's the garden he has laid out."exclaimed Eli, going quickly towards the garden
fence."We'll look at that by-and-by," said Margit; "now we must go over to
look at the creatures before they're locked in--" But Eli did not
hear, for all her mind was turned to the garden.She stood looking
at it till Margit called her once more; as she came along, she gave a
furtive glance through the windows; but she could see no one inside.They both went upon the barn steps and looked down at the cows, as
they passed lowing into the cattle-house.Margit named them one by
one to Eli, and told her how much milk each gave, and which would
calve in the summer, and which would not.The sheep were counted and
penned in; they were of a large foreign breed, raised from two lambs
which Arne had got from the South."He aims at all such things," said
Margit, "though one wouldn't think it of him."Then they went into
the barn, and looked at some hay which had been brought in, and Eli
had to smell it; "for such hay isn't to be found everywhere," Margit
said.She pointed from the barn-hatch to the fields, and told what
kind of seed was sown on them, and how much of each kind."No less
than three fields are new-cleared, and now, this first year, they're
set with potatoes, just for the sake of the ground; over there, too,
the land's new-cleared, but I suppose that soil's different, for
there he has sown barley; but then he has strewed burnt turf over it
for manure, for he attends to all such things.Well, she that comes
here will find things in good order, I'm sure."Now they went out
towards the dwelling-house; and Eli, who had answered nothing to all
that Margit had told her about other things, when they passed the
garden asked if she might go into it; and when she got leave to go,
she begged to pick a flower or two.Away in one corner was a little
garden-seat; she went over and sat down upon it--perhaps only to try
it, for she rose directly."Now we must make haste, else we shall be too late," said Margit, as
she stood at the house-door.Margit asked if Eli
would not take some refreshment, as this was the first time she had
been at Kampen; but Eli turned red and quickly refused.Then they
looked round the room, which was the one Arne and the mother
generally used in the day-time; it was not very large, but cosy and
pleasant, with windows looking out on the road.There were a clock
and a stove; and on the wall hung Nils' fiddle, old and dark, but
with new strings; beside it hung some guns belonging to Arne, English
fishing-tackle and other rare things, which the mother took down and
showed to Eli, who looked at them and touched them.The room was
without painting, for this Arne did not like; neither was there any
in the large pretty room which looked towards the ravine, with the
green mountains on the other side, and the blue peaks in the
background.But the two smaller rooms in the wing were both painted;
for in them the mother would live when she became old, and Arne
brought a wife into the house: Margit was very fond of painting, and
so in these rooms the ceilings were painted with roses, and her name
was painted on the cupboards, the bedsteads, and on all reasonable
and unreasonable places; for it was Arne himself who had done it.They went into the kitchen, the store-room, and the bake-house; and
now they had only to go into the up-stairs rooms; "all the best
things were there," the mother said.These were comfortable rooms, corresponding with those below, but
they were new and not yet taken into use, save one which looked
towards the ravine.In them hung and stood all sorts of household
things not in every-day use.Here hung a lot of fur coverlets and
other bedclothes; and the mother took hold of them and lifted them;
so did Eli, who looked at all of them with pleasure, examined some of
them twice, and asked questions about them, growing all the while
more interested."Now we'll find the key of Arne's room," said the mother, taking it
from under a chest where it was hidden.They went into the room; it
looked towards the ravine; and once more the awful booming of the
waterfall met their ears, for the window was open.They could see the
spray rising between the cliffs, but not the fall itself, save in one
place farther up, where a huge fragment of rock had fallen into it
just where the torrent came in full force to take its last leap into
the depths below.The upper side of this fragment was covered with
fresh sod; and a few pine-cones had dug themselves into it, and had
grown up to trees, rooted into the crevices.The wind had shaken and
twisted them; and the fall had dashed against them, so that they had
not a sprig lower than eight feet from their roots: they were gnarled
and bent; yet they stood, rising high between the rocky walls.When
Eli looked out from the window, these trees first caught her eye;
next, she saw the snowy peaks rising far beyond behind the green
mountains.Then her eyes passed over the quiet fertile fields back to
the room; and the first thing she saw there was a large bookshelf.There were so many books on it that she scarcely believed the
Clergyman had more.Daniel travelled to the office.Beneath it was a cupboard, where Arne kept his
money.The mother said money had been left to them twice already, and
if everything went right they would have some more."But, after all,
money's not the best thing in the world; he may get what's better
still," she added.There were many little things in the cupboard which were amusing to
see, and Eli looked at them all, happy as a child.Then the mother
showed her a large chest where Arne's clothes lay, and they, too,
were taken out and looked at."I've never seen you till to-day, and yet I'm already so fond of you,
my child," she said, looking affectionately into her eyes.Eli had
scarcely time to feel a little bashful, before Margit pulled her by
the hand and said in a low voice, "Look at that little red chest;
there's something very choice in that, you may be sure."Eli glanced towards the chest: it was a little square one, which she
thought she would very much like to have."He doesn't want me to know what's in that chest," the mother
whispered; "and he always hides the key."She went to some clothes
that hung on the wall, took down a velvet waistcoat, looked in the
pocket, and there found the key."Now come and look," she whispered; and they went gently, and knelt
down before the chest.As soon as the mother opened it, so sweet an
odor met them that Eli clapped her hands even before she had seen
anything.On the top was spread a handkerchief, which the mother
took away."Here, look," she whispered, taking out a fine black
silk neckerchief such as men do not wear."It looks just as if it
was meant for a girl," the mother said.Eli spread it upon her lap
and looked at it, but did not say a word."Here's one more," the
mother said.Eli could not help taking it up; and then the mother
insisted upon trying it on her, though Eli drew back and held her
head down.She did not know what she would not have given for such a
neckerchief; but she thought of something more than that.They
folded them up again, but slowly."Now, look here," the mother said, taking out some handsome ribands."Everything seems as if it was for a girl."Eli blushed crimson, but
she said nothing."There's some more things yet," said the mother,
taking out some fine black cloth for a dress; "it's fine, I dare
say," she added, holding it up to the light.Eli's hands trembled,
her chest heaved, she felt the blood rushing to her head, and she
would fain have turned away, but that she could not well do."He has bought something every time he has been to town," continued
the mother.Eli could scarcely bear it any longer; she looked from
one thing to another in the chest, and then again at the cloth, and
her face burned.The next thing the mother took out was wrapped in
paper; they unwrapped it, and found a small pair of shoes.Anything
like them, they had never seen, and the mother wondered how they
could be made.Eli said nothing; but when she touched the shoes her
fingers left warm marks on them."I'm hot, I think," she whispered."Doesn't it seem just as if he had bought them all, one after
another, for somebody he was afraid to give them to?""He has kept them here in this chest--so long."She
laid them all in the chest again, just as they were before."Now
we'll see what's here in the compartment," she said, opening the lid
carefully, as if she were now going to show Eli something specially
beautiful.When Eli looked she saw first a broad buckle for a waistband, next,
two gold rings tied together, and a hymn-book bound in velvet and
with silver clasps; but then she saw nothing more, for on the silver
of the book she had seen graven in small letters, "Eli Baardsdatter
Boeen."The mother wished her to look at something else; she got no answer,
but saw tear after tear dropping down upon the silk neckerchief and
spreading over it.She put down the _sylgje_[5] which she had in her
hand, shut the lid, turned round and drew Eli to her.Then the
daughter wept upon her breast, and the mother wept over her, without
either of them saying any more.[5] _Sylgje_, a peculiar kind of brooch worn in Norway.--Translators.*       *       *       *       *

A little while after, Eli walked by herself in the garden, while the
mother was in the kitchen preparing something nice for supper; for
now Arne would soon be at home.Then she came out in the garden to
Eli, who sat tracing names on the sand with a stick.When she saw
Margit, she smoothed the sand down over them, looked up and smiled;
but she had been weeping."There's nothing to cry about, my child," said Margit, caressing her;
"supper's ready now; and here comes Arne," she added, as a black
figure appeared on the road between the shrubs.Eli stole in, and the mother followed her.The supper-table was
nicely spread with dried meat, cakes and cream porridge; Eli did not
look at it, however, but went away to a corner near the clock and sat
down on a chair close to the wall, trembling at every sound.Firm steps were heard on the flagstones,
and a short, light step in the passage, the door was gently opened,
and Arne came in.The first thing he saw was Eli in the corner; he left hold on the
door and stood still.This made Eli feel yet more confused; she rose,
but then felt sorry she had done so, and turned aside towards the
wall.She held her hand before her face, as one does when the sun shines
into the eyes.She put her hand down again, and turned a little towards him, but
then bent her head and burst into tears.She did not answer,
but wept still more.She leant
her head upon his breast, and he whispered something down to her; she
did not answer, but clasped her hands round his neck.They stood thus for a long while; and not a sound was heard, save
that of the fall which still gave its eternal warning, though distant
and subdued.Then some one over against the table was heard weeping;
Arne looked up: it was the mother; but he had not noticed her till
then."Now, I'm sure you won't go away from me, Arne," she said,
coming across the floor to him; and she wept much, but it did her
good, she said.*       *       *       *       *

Later, when they had supped and said good-bye to the mother, Eli and
Arne walked together along the road to the parsonage.It was one of
those light summer nights when all things seem to whisper and crowd
together, as if in fear.Even he who has from childhood been
accustomed to such nights, feels strangely influenced by them, and
goes about as if expecting something to happen: light is there, but
not life.Often the sky is tinged with blood-red, and looks out
between the pale clouds like an eye that has watched.One seems to
hear a whispering all around, but it comes only from one's own brain,
which is over-excited.Man shrinks, feels his own littleness, and
thinks of his God.Those two who were walking here also kept close to each other; they
felt as if they had too much happiness, and they feared it might be
taken from them."I can hardly believe it," Arne said."I feel almost the same," said Eli, looking dreamily before her."_Yet it's true_," he said, laying stress on each word; "now I am no
longer going about only thinking; for once I have done something."He paused a few moments, and then laughed, but not gladly."No, it
was not I," he said; "it was mother who did it."He seemed to have continued this thought, for after a while he said,
"Up to this day I have done nothing; not taken my part in anything.He went on a little farther, and then said warmly, "God be thanked
that I have got through in this way;... now people will not have to
see many things which would not have been as they ought...." Then
after a while he added, "But if some one had not helped me, perhaps I
should have gone on alone for ever.""What do you think father will say, dear?"asked Eli, who had been
busy with her own thoughts."I am going over to Boeen early to-morrow morning," said
Arne;--"_that_, at any rate, I must do myself," he added, determining
he would now be cheerful and brave, and never think of sad things
again; no, never!"And, Eli, it was you who found my song in the
nut-wood?""And the tune I had made it for, you got hold
of, too.""I took the one which suited it," she said, looking down.He smiled
joyfully and bent his face down to hers."But the other song you did not know?"she asked looking up....

"Eli... you mustn't be angry with me... but one day this spring...
yes, I couldn't help it, I heard you singing on the parsonage-hill."She blushed and looked down, but then she laughed."Then, after all,
you have been served just right," she said."Well--it was; nay, it wasn't my fault; it was your mother... well
... another time...."

"Nay; tell it me now."She would not;--then he stopped and exclaimed, "Surely, you haven't
been up-stairs?"He was so grave that she felt frightened, and looked
down."Mother has perhaps found the key to that little chest?"She hesitated, looked up and smiled, but it seemed as if only to keep
back her tears; then he laid his arm round her neck and drew her
still closer to him.He trembled, lights seemed flickering before his
eyes, his head burned, he bent over her and his lips sought hers, but
could hardly find them; he staggered, withdrew his arm, and turned
aside, afraid to look at her.The clouds had taken such strange
shapes; there was one straight before him which looked like a goat
with two great horns, and standing on its hind legs; and there was
the nose of an old woman with her hair tangled; and there was the
picture of a big man, which was set slantwise, and then was suddenly
rent.... But just over the mountain the sky was blue and clear; the
cliff stood gloomy, while the lake lay quietly beneath it, afraid to
move; pale and misty it lay, forsaken both by sun and moon, but the
wood went down to it, full of love just as before.Some birds woke
and twittered half in sleep; answers came over from one copse and
then from another, but there was no danger at hand, and they slept
once more... there was peace all around.Arne felt its blessedness
lying over him as it lay over the evening.he said, so that he heard the words
himself, and he folded his hands, but went a little before Eli that
she might not see it.It was in the end of harvest-time, and the corn was being carried.It
was a bright day; there had been rain in the night and earlier in
morning, but now the air was clear and mild as in summer-time.It was
Saturday; yet many boats were steering over the Swart-water towards
the church; the men, in their white shirt-sleeves, sat rowing, while
the women, with light- kerchiefs on their heads, sat in the
stern and the forepart.But still more boats were steering towards
Boeen, in readiness to go out thence in procession; for to-day Baard
Boeen kept the wedding of his daughter, Eli, and Arne Nilsson Kampen.The doors were all open, people went in and out, children with pieces
of cake in their hands stood in the yard, fidgety about their new
clothes, and looking distantly at each other; an old woman sat lonely
and weeping on the steps of the storehouse: it was Margit Kampen.She
wore a large silver ring, with several small rings fastened to the
upper plate; and now and then she looked at it: Nils gave it her on
their wedding-day, and she had never worn it since.The purveyor of the feast and the two young brides-men--the
Clergyman's son and Eli's brother--went about in the rooms offering
refreshments to the wedding-guests as they arrived.Up-stairs in
Eli's room, were the Clergyman's lady, the bride and Mathilde, who
had come from town only to put on her bridal-dress and ornaments,
for this they had promised each other from childhood.Arne was
dressed in a fine cloth suit, round jacket, black hat, and a collar
that Eli had made; and he was in one of the down-stairs rooms,
standing at the window where she wrote "Arne."It was open, and he
leant upon the sill, looking away over the calm water towards the
distant bight and the church.Outside in the passage, two met as they came from doing their part in
the day's duties.The one came from the stepping-stones on the shore,
where he had been arranging the church-boats; he wore a round black
jacket of fine cloth, and blue frieze trousers, off which the dye
came, making his hands blue; his white collar looked well against his
fair face and long light hair; his high forehead was calm, and a
quiet smile lay round his lips.She whom he met had
just come from the kitchen, dressed ready to go to church.She was
tall and upright, and came through the door somewhat hurriedly, but
with a firm step; when she met Baard she stopped, and her mouth drew
to one side.Each had something to say to
the other, but neither could find words for it.Baard was even more
embarrassed than she; he smiled more and more, and at last turned
towards the staircase, saying as he began to step up, "Perhaps you'll
come too."Here, up-stairs, was no one but
themselves; yet Baard locked the door after them, and he was a long
while about it.When at last he turned round, Birgit stood looking
out from the window, perhaps to avoid looking in the room.Baard took
from his breast-pocket a little silver cup, and a little bottle of
wine, and poured out some for her.But she would not take any, though
he told her it was wine the Clergyman had sent them.Then he drank
some himself, but offered it to her several times while he was
drinking.He corked the bottle, put it again into his pocket with the
cup, and sat down on a chest.He breathed deeply several times, looked down and said, "I'm so
happy-to-day; and I thought I must speak freely with you; it's a long
while since I did so."Birgit stood leaning with one hand upon the window-sill.Baard went
on, "I've been thinking about Nils, the tailor, to-day; he separated
us two; I thought it wouldn't go beyond our wedding, but it has gone
farther.To-day, a son of his, well-taught and handsome, is taken
into our family, and we have given him our only daughter.What now,
if we, Birgit, were to keep our wedding once again, and keep it so
that we can never more be separated?"His voice trembled, and he gave a little cough.Birgit laid her head
down upon her arm, but said nothing.Baard waited long, but he got no
answer, and he had himself nothing more to say.He looked up and grew
very pale, for she did not even turn her head.At the same moment came a gentle knock at the door, and a soft voice
asked, "Are you coming now, mother?"Birgit raised her
head, and, looking towards the door, she saw Baard's pale face."Yes, now I am coming," said Birgit in a broken voice, while she gave
her hand to Baard, and burst into a violent flood of tears.The two hands pressed each other; they were both toilworn now, but
they clasped as firmly as if they had sought each other for twenty
years.They were still locked together, when Baard and Birgit went to
the door; and afterwards when the bridal train went down to the
stepping-stones on the shore, and Arne gave his hand to Eli, Baard
looked at them, and, against all custom, took Birgit by the hand and
followed them with a bright smile.But Margit Kampen went behind them lonely.Baard was quite overjoyed that day.While he was talking with the
rowers, one of them, who sat looking at the mountains behind, said
how strange it was that even such a steep cliff could be clad."Ah,
whether it wishes to be, or not, it must," said Baard, looking all
along the train till his eyes rested on the bridal pair and his wife."Who could have foretold this twenty years ago?"Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by John Wilson & Son.THE

insight into the feelings and tastes of childhood, and desirous to
awaken its finest impulses, to cultivate its keenest sensibilities."CINCINNATI GAZETTE."The University Press at Cambridge has turned out many wonderful
specimens of the art, but in exquisite finish it has never equalled
the evidence of its skill which now lies before us.The text,
compared with the average specimens of modern books, shines out with
as bright a contrast as an Elzevir by the side of one of its dingy

vignettes and head-pieces, the size of its pages, in every feature
that can gratify the eye, indeed, the 'Garland' could hardly bear
improvement.Similar in its general getting up to the much-admired
Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics, issued by the same

of various minor details.""It is a beautiful book,--the most beautiful in some respects that

wide range of themes as none but a poet could have done.A choice
cabinet of precious jewels, or better still, a dainty wreath of

THE CHOICEST ANECDOTES AND SAYINGS

SELECTED AND ARRANGED
BY MARK LEMON

16mo.Here is an interest for a minute or a
dull day.Mark Lemon gives us the result of his recondite searches
and seizures in the regions of infinite jest.Like all good jesters,
he has the quality of sound philosophy in him, and of reason also,
for he discriminates closely, and serves up his wit with a deal of
refinement in it.""So exquisitely is the book printed, that every jest in it shines
like a new gold dollar.It is the apotheosis of jokes.... There is
jollity enough in it to keep the whole American press good humored.""Mark Lemon, who helps to flavor Punch, has gathered this volume of
anecdotes, this parcel of sharp and witty sayings, and we have no
fear in declaring that the reader will find it a book of some wisdom
and much amusement.By this single 'Lemon' we judge of the rest.""This little volume is a very agreeable provocative of mirth, and as
such, it will be useful in driving dull care away.""It contains many old jokes, which like good wine become all the
better for age, and many new and fugitive ones which until now never
had a local habitation and a name.""For a fireside we can imagine nothing more diverting or more likely
to be laughed over during the intervals of labor or study."She is very lonely, this little girl--lonely without even knowing
it, but none the less to be pitied on that account.To her step-mother
Ruby never even dreams of turning for comfort or advice in her small
troubles and griefs.Dad is his little girl’s _confidant_; but, then,
dad is often away, and in Mrs.Thorne’s presence Ruby never thinks of
confiding in her father.It is a hot sunny morning in the early months of the new year.Ruby is
riding by her father’s side along the river’s bank, Black Prince doing
his very best to accommodate his long steps to Smuttie’s slower amble.Far over the long flats of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue
haze, forerunner of a day of intense heat.But Ruby and dad are early
astir this morning, and it is still cool and fresh with the beautiful
young freshness of a glorious summer morning.“It’s lovely just now,” Ruby says, with a little sigh of satisfaction.“I wish it would always stay early morning; don’t you, dad?It’s like
where it says in the hymn about ‘the summer morn I’ve sighed for.’
P’raps that means that it will always be morning in heaven.I hope it
will.”

“It will be a very fair summer morn anyway, little girl,” says dad, a
sudden far-away look coming into his brown eyes.At the child’s words, his thoughts have gone back with a sudden rush of
memory to another summer’s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt by
the bedside where his young wife lay gasping out her life, and watched
Ruby’s mother go home to God.“I’ll be waiting for you, Will,” she had
whispered only a little while before she went away.“It won’t be so
very long, my darling; for even heaven won’t be quite heaven to me with
you away.” And as the dawning rose over the purple hill-tops, and the
birds’ soft twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born day, the
angels had come for Ruby’s mother, and the dawning for her had been the
glorious dawning of heaven.Many a year has passed away since then, sorrowfully enough at first for
the desolate husband, all unheeded by the child, who never missed her
mother because she never knew her.Nowadays new hopes, new interests
have come to Will Thorne, dimming with their fresher links the dear old
days of long ago.He has not forgotten the love of his youth, never
will; but time has softened the bitterness of his sorrow, and caused
him to think but with a gentle regret of the woman whom God had called
away in the suntime of her youth.But Ruby’s words have come to him
this summer morning awakening old memories long slumbering, and his
thoughts wander from the dear old days, up--up--up to God’s land on
high, where, in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is waiting
longingly, hopefully--one who, even up in heaven, will be bitterly
disappointed if those who in the old days she loved more than life
itself will not one day join her there.“Dad,” Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled little face to that
other dear one above her, “what is the matter?You looked so sorry, so
very sorry, just now,” adds the little girl, with something almost like
a sob.Did I?” says the father, with a swift sudden smile.He bends
down to the little figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,
brown hair.“I was thinking of your mother, Ruby,” dad says.“But
instead of looking sorry I should have looked glad, that for her all
tears are for ever past, and that nothing can ever harm her now.I was
thinking of her at heaven’s gate, darling, watching, as she said she
would, for you and for me.”

“I wonder,” says Ruby, with very thoughtful brown eyes, “how will I
know her?God will have to tell her,
won’t He?And p’raps I’ll be quite grown up ’fore I die, and mother
won’t think it’s her own little Ruby at all.I wish I knew,” adds the
child, in a puzzled voice.“God will make it all right, dear.I have no fear of that,” says the
father, quickly.It is not often that Ruby and he talk as they are doing now.Like all
true Scotchmen, he is reticent by nature, reverencing that which is
holy too much to take it lightly upon his lips.As for Ruby, she has
never even thought of such things.In her gay, sunny life she has had
no time to think of the mother awaiting her coming in the land which
to Ruby, in more senses than one, is “very far off.”

Far in the distance the early sunshine gleams on the river, winding out
and in like a silver thread.The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,
their green leaves faintly rustling in the soft summer wind.And above
all stretches the blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a fleecy
cloud, beyond which, as the children tell us, lies God’s happiest land.It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby’s eyes have gazed on often,
with but little thought or appreciation of its beauty.But to-day her
thoughts are far away, beyond another river which all must pass, where
the shadows only fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness
of the light beyond.And still another river rises before the little
girl’s eyes, a river, clear as crystal, the “beautiful, beautiful
river” by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the most weary shall one
day cease, the burden of even the most heavy-laden, one day be laid
down.On what beauties must not her mother’s eyes be now gazing!But
even midst the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how can that fond,
loving heart be quite content if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with
her there?All the way home the little girl is very thoughtful, and a strange
quietness seems to hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder of
the day.But towards evening a great surprise is in store for her.Dick, whose
duty it is, when his master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the
nearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a parcel in his bag,
addressed in very big letters to “Miss Ruby Thorne.” With fingers
trembling with excitement the child cuts the string.Within is a long
white box, and within the box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever
even imagined, a doll with golden curls and closed eyes, who, when
set upright, discloses the bluest of blue orbs.She is dressed in the
daintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze shoes encase her
feet.She is altogether, as Ruby ecstatically exclaims, “a love of a
doll,” and seems but little the worse for her long journey across the
briny ocean.“It’s from Jack!” cries Ruby, her eyes shining.“Oh, and here’s a
letter pinned to dolly’s dress!What a nice writer he is!” The child’s
cheeks flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more as she tears the
envelope open.“I’ll read it first to myself, mamma, and then I’ll give
it to you.”

    “MY DEAR LITTLE RUBY” (so the letter runs),

    “I have very often thought of you since last we parted, and now do
    myself the pleasure of sending madam across the sea in charge of
    my letter to you.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper
    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend
    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.How
    are the dollies?Bluebell and her other ladyship--I have forgotten
    her name.I often think of you this bleak, cold weather, and envy
    you your Australian sunshine just as, I suppose, you often envy
    me my bonnie Scotland.I am looking forward to the day when you
    are coming home on that visit you spoke of.We must try and have
    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother’s home,
    isn’t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend
    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you
    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,
    and, looking forward to next Christmas,

                          “I remain, my dear little Ruby red,
                                                “Your old friend,
                                                             “JACK.”

“Very good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl’s account,”
remarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am
sure he would like to have a letter from you.”

“I just love him,” says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.“I wish
I could call the doll after him; but then, ‘Jack’ would never do for
a lady’s name.I know what I’ll do!” with a little dance of delight.“I’ll call her ‘May’ after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I’ll call her ‘Kirke’ for her second name, and that’ll be after Jack.I’ll tell him that when I write, and I’d better send him back his card
too.”

That very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to
her friend.“MY DEAR JACK” (writes Ruby in her large round hand),

[“I don’t know what else to say,” murmurs the little girl, pausing with
her pen uplifted.“I never wrote a letter before.”

“Thank him for the doll, of course,” advises Mrs.Thorne, with an
amused smile.“That is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.”

So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]

    “Thank you very much for the doll.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED

  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.In the case of the group of writers who, after a century of criticism,
ventured once more with an intrepid confidence--differing fundamentally
from the tone of preceding apologists in the Protestant camp, who were
nearly as critical as the men they refuted--to vindicate not the bare
outlines of Christian faith, but the entire scheme, in its extreme
manifestation, of the most ancient and severely maligned of all
Christian organisations, this apathy is very much to be regretted on
several grounds.In the first place, it is impossible to see
intelligently to the bottom of the momentous spirit of ultramontanism,
which is so deep a difficulty of continental Europe, and which, touching
us in Ireland, is perhaps already one of our own deepest difficulties,
without comprehending in its best shape the theory on which
ultramontanism rests.And this theory it is impossible to seize
thoroughly, without some knowledge of the ideas of its most efficient
defenders in its earlier years.Secondly, it is among these ideas that
we have to look for the representation in their most direct, logical,
uncompromising, and unmistakable form of those theological ways of
regarding life and prescribing right conduct, whose more or less rapidly
accelerated destruction is the first condition of the further elevation
of humanity, as well in power of understanding as in morals and
spirituality.In all contests of this kind there is the greatest and
most obvious advantage in being able to see your enemy full against the
light.Thirdly, in one or two respects, the Catholic reactionaries at
the beginning of the century insisted very strongly on principles of
society which the general thought of the century before had almost
entirely dropped out of sight, and which we who, in spite of many
differences, still sail down the same great current, and are propelled
by the same great tide, are accustomed almost equally either to leave in
the background of speculation, or else deliberately to deny and
suppress.Such we may account the importance which they attach to
organisation, and the value they set upon a common spiritual faith and
doctrine as a social basis.That the form which the recognition of these
principles is destined to assume will at all correspond to their hopes
and anticipations, is one of the most unlikely things possible.This,
however, need not detract from the worth for our purpose of their
exposition of the principles themselves.Again, the visible traces of
the impression made by the writings of this school on the influential
founder of the earliest Positivist system, are sufficiently deep and
important to make some knowledge of them of the highest historical
interest, both to those who accept and those who detest that system.At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were three chief
schools of thought, the Sensational, the Catholic, and the Eclectic; or
as it may be put in other terms, the Materialist, the Theological, and
the Spiritualist.The first looked for the sources of knowledge, the
sanction of morals, the inspiring fountain and standard of aesthetics, to
the outside of men, to matter, and the impressions made by matter on the
corporeal senses.The second looked to divine revelation, authority and
the traditions of the Church.The third, steering a middle course,
looked partly within and partly without, relied partly on the senses,
partly on revelation and history, but still more on a certain internal
consciousness of a direct and immediate kind, which is the supreme and
reconciling judge of the reports alike of the senses, of history, of
divine revelation.[1] Each of these schools had many exponents.The
three most conspicuous champions of revived Catholicism were De Maistre,
De Bonald, and Chateaubriand.The last of them, the author of the _Genie
du Christianisme_, was effective in France because he is so deeply
sentimental, but he was too little trained in speculation, and too
little equipped with knowledge, to be fairly taken as the best
intellectual representative of their way of thinking.De Bonald was of
much heavier calibre.He really thought, while Chateaubriand only felt,
and the _Legislation Primitive_ and the _Pensees sur Divers Sujets_
contain much that an enemy of the school will find it worth while to
read, in spite of an artificial, and, if a foreigner may judge, a
detestable style.De Maistre was the greatest of the three, and deserves better than
either of the others to stand as the type of the school for many
reasons.His style is so marvellously lucid, that, notwithstanding the
mystical, or, as he said, the illuminist side of his mind, we can never
be in much doubt about his meaning, which is not by any means the case
with Bonald.To say nothing of his immensely superior natural capacity,
De Maistre's extensive reading in the literature of his foes was a
source of strength, which might indeed have been thought indispensable,
if only other persons had not attacked the same people as he did,
without knowing much or anything at all at first-hand about them.Then
he goes over the whole field of allied subjects, which we have a right
to expect to have handled by anybody with a systematic view of the
origin of knowledge, the meaning of ethics, the elements of social order
and progressiveness, the government and scheme of the universe.And
above all, his writings are penetrated with the air of reality and life,
which comes of actual participation in the affairs of that world with
which social philosophers have to deal.Lamennais had in many respects a
finer mind than De Maistre, but the conclusions in which he was finally
landed, no less than his liberal aims, prevent him from being an example
of the truly Catholic reaction.He obviously represented the Revolution,
or the critical spirit, within the Catholic limits, while De Maistre's
ruling idea was, in his own trenchant phrase, '_absolument tuer
l'esprit du dix-huitieme siecle_.'On all these accounts he appears to
be the fittest expositor of those conceptions which the anarchy that
closed the eighteenth century provoked into systematic existence.FOOTNOTE:

Joseph de Maistre was born at Chambery in the year 1754.[2] His family
was the younger branch of a stock in Languedoc, which about the
beginning of the seventeenth century divided itself into two, one
remaining in France, the other establishing itself in Piedmont.It is
not wonderful that the descendants of the latter, settled in a country
of small extent and little political importance, placed a high value on
their kinship with an ancient line in the powerful kingdom of France.Joseph de Maistre himself was always particularly anxious to cultivate
close relations with his French kinsfolk, partly from the old
aristocratic feeling of blood, and partly from his intellectual
appreciation of the gifts of the French mind, and its vast influence as
an universal propagating power.His father held a high office in the
government of Savoy, and enjoyed so eminent a reputation that on his
death both the Senate and the King of Sardinia deliberately recorded
their appreciation of his loss as a public calamity.His mother is said
to have been a woman of lofty and devout character, and her influence
over her eldest son was exceptionally strong and tender.He used to
declare in after life that he was as docile in her hands as the youngest
of his sisters.Among other marks of his affectionate submission to
parental authority, we are told that during the whole time of his
residence at Turin, where he followed a course of law, he never read a
single book without previously writing to Chambery to one or other of
his parents for their sanction.Such traditions linger in families, and
when he came to have children of his own, they too read nothing of which
their father had not been asked to express his approbation.De Maistre's
early education was directed by the Jesuits; and as might have been
expected from the generous susceptibility of his temper, he never ceased
to think of them with warm esteem.To the end of his life he remembered
the gloom which fell upon the household, though he was not nine years
old at the time, when the news arrived of the edict of 1764, abolishing
the Society in the kingdom of France.One element of his education he
commemorates in a letter to his favourite daughter.'Let your brother,'
he says, 'work hard at the French poets.Let him learn them by heart,
especially the incomparable Racine; never mind whether he understands
him yet or not.I didn't understand him when my mother used to come
repeating his verses by my bedside, and lulled me to sleep with her
fine voice to the sound of that inimitable music.I knew hundreds of
lines long before I knew how to read; and it is thus that my ears,
accustomed betimes to this ambrosia, have never since been able to
endure any sourer draught.'After his law studies at the University of Turin, then highly renowned
for its jurisconsults, the young De Maistre went through the successive
stages of an official career, performing various duties in the public
administration, and possessing among other honours a seat in the Senate,
over which his father presided.He led a tranquil life at Chambery, then
as at all other times an ardent reader and student.Unaided he taught
himself five languages.English he mastered so perfectly, that though he
could not follow it when spoken, he could read a book in that tongue
with as much ease as if it had been in his own.To Greek and German he
did not apply himself until afterwards, and he never acquired the same
proficiency in them as in English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.To be ignorant of German then, it will be remembered, was not what it
would be now, to be without one of the literary senses.Like nearly every other great soldier of reaction, he showed in his
early life a decided inclination for new ideas.The truth that the
wildest extravagances of youthful aspiration are a better omen of a
vigorous and enlightened manhood than the decorous and ignoble faith in
the perfection of existing arrangements, was not belied in the case of
De Maistre.His intelligence was of too hard and exact a kind to
inspire him with the exalted schemes that present themselves to those
more nobly imaginative minds who dream dreams and see visions.He
projected no Savoyard emigration to the banks of the Susquehanna or
Delaware, to found millennial societies and pantisocratic unions.These
generous madnesses belong to men of more poetic temper.But still, in
spite of the deadening influences of officialism and relations with a
court, De Maistre had far too vigorous and active a character to subside
without resistance into the unfruitful ways of obstruction and social
complacency.It is one of the most certain marks, we may be sure, of a
superior spirit, that the impulses earliest awakened by its first fresh
contact with the facts of the outer world are those which quicken a
desire for the improvement of the condition of society, the increase of
the happiness of men, the amelioration of human destiny.With this
unwritten condition of human nature De Maistre, like other men of his
mental calibre, is found to have complied.He incurred the suspicion and
ill-will of most of those by whom he was immediately surrounded, by
belonging to a Reform Lodge at Chambery.The association was one of a
perfectly harmless character, but being an association, it diffused a
tarnishing vapour of social disaffection and insurgency over the names
of all who ventured to belong to it, and De Maistre was pointed out to
the Sardinian court as a man with leanings towards new things, and
therefore one of whom it were well to beware.In very small countries there is seldom room enough
for the growth of a spirit of social revolution; not at least until some
great and dominant country has released the forces of destruction.So,
when the menacing sounds of the approaching hurricane in France grew
heavy in the air, the little lodge at Chambery voluntarily dissolved
itself, and De Maistre was deputed to convey to the king, Victor Amadeo
III., the honourable assurance of its members that they had assembled
for the last time.In 1786, at the age of thirty-two, De Maistre had married, and when the
storm burst which destroyed all the hopes of his life, he was the father
of two children.In one of his gay letters to a venerable lady who was
on intimate terms with them both, he has left a picture of his wife,
which is not any less interesting for what it reveals of his own
character.'The contrast between us two is the very strangest in the
world.For me, as you may have found out, I am the _pococurante_
senator, and above all things very free in saying what I think.She, on
the contrary, will take care that it is noon before allowing that the
sun has risen, for fear of committing herself.She knows what must be
done or what must not be done on the tenth of October 1808, at ten
o'clock in the morning, to avoid some inconvenience which otherwise
would come to pass at midnight between the fifteenth and sixteenth of
March 1810."But, my dear husband, you pay attention to nothing; you
believe that nobody is thinking of any harm.Now I know, I have been
told, I have guessed, I foresee, I warn you," etc."Come now, my dear,
leave me alone.You are only wasting your time: I foresee that I shall
never foresee things: that's your business."She is the supplement to
me, and hence when I am separated from her, as I am now, I suffer
absurdly from being obliged to think about my own affairs; I would
rather have to chop wood all day.... My children ought to kiss her very
steps; for my part, I have no gift for education.She has such a gift,
that I look upon it as nothing less than the eighth endowment of the
Holy Ghost; I mean a certain fond persecution by which it is given her
to torment her children from morning to night to do something, not to do
something, to learn--and yet without for a moment losing their tender
affection for her.She was
laughingly called by himself and her friends, Madame Prudence.It is
certain that few women have found more necessity for the qualities
implied in this creditable nickname.They had not been married many years before they were overtaken by
irreparable disaster.The French Revolution broke out, and Savoy was
invaded by the troops of the new Republic.Count De Maistre, with his
wife and children, fled from Chambery across the Alps to Aosta.'_Ma
chere amie_,' he said to his wife, by the side of a great rock which he
never afterwards forgot, 'the step that we are taking to-day is
irrevocable; it decides our lot for life;' and the presentiment was
true.Soon the _Loi des Allobroges_ was promulgated, which enjoined upon
all who had left their homes in Savoy to return instantly, under pain of
confiscation of all their property.Madame de Maistre was in the ninth month of her pregnancy.She knew that
her husband would endure anything rather than expose her to the risks of
a journey in such a season.So, urged by a desire to save something from
the wreck of their fortune by compliance with the French decree, she
seized the opportunity of her husband's absence at Turin, and started
for Savoy without acquainting him with her design.Bernard in the beginning of January on the back of a mule,
accompanied by her two little children wrapped in blankets.The Count,
on his return to Aosta two or three days afterwards, forthwith set off
in her steps, in the trembling expectation of finding her dead or dying
in some Alpine hovel.But the favour of fate and a stout heart brought
her safe to Chambery, where shortly afterwards she was joined by her
husband.The authorities vainly tendered him the oath, vainly bade him
inscribe his name on the register of citizens; and when they asked him
for a contribution to support the war, he replied curtly that he did not
give money to kill his brothers in the service of the King of Sardinia.As soon as his wife was delivered of their third child, whom he was
destined not to see again for nearly twenty years, he quitted her side,
abandoned his property and his country, and took refuge at Lausanne,
where in time his wife and his two eldest children once more came to
him.Gibbon tells us how a swarm of emigrants, escaping from the public ruin,
was attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the language of
Lausanne.'They are entitled to our pity,' he reflected, 'and they may
claim our esteem, but they cannot in their present state of mind and
fortune contribute much to our amusement.Instead of looking down as
calm and idle spectators on the theatre of Europe, our domestic harmony
is somewhat embittered by the infusion of party spirit.'Gibbon died in
London almost at the very moment that De Maistre arrived at Lausanne,
but his account of things remained true, and political feuds continued
to run as high as ever.Among the people with whom De Maistre was thrown
was Madame de Stael.'As we had not been to the same school,' he says,
'either in theology or in politics, we had some scenes enough to make
one die of laughter; still without quarrelling.Her father, who was then
alive, was the friend and relative of people that I love with all my
heart, and that I would not vex for all the world.So I allowed the
_emigres_ who surrounded us to cry out as they would, without ever
drawing the sword.'De Maistre thought he never came across a head so
completely turned wrong as Madame de Stael's, the infallible
consequence, as he took it to be, of modern philosophy operating upon a
woman's nature.if Madame de Stael had been
Catholic, she would have been adorable, instead of famous.'We can
believe that his position among the French _emigres_ was not
particularly congenial.For though they hated the Revolution, they had
all drunk of the waters of the eighteenth century philosophy, and De
Maistre hated this philosophy worse than he hated the Revolution itself.Then again, they would naturally vapour about the necessities of strong
government.'Yes,' said the Savoyard exile, 'but be quite sure that, to
make the monarchy strong, you must rest it on the laws, avoiding
everything arbitrary, too frequent commissions, and all ministerial
jobberies.'We may well believe how unsavoury this rational and just
talk was to people who meant by strong government a system that should
restore to them their old prerogatives of anti-social oppression and
selfish corruption.The order that De Maistre vindicated was a very
different thing from the deadly and poisonous order which was the object
of the prayers of the incorrigible royalists around him.After staying three years at Lausanne, De Maistre went to Turin, but
shortly afterwards the Sardinian king, at the end of a long struggle,
was forced to succumb to the power of the French, then in the full tide
of success.Bonaparte's brilliant Italian campaign needs no words here.The French entered Turin, and De Maistre, being an _emigre_, had to
leave it.Furnished with a false passport, and undergoing a thousand
hardships and dangers, he made his way, once more in the depth of a
severe winter (1797), to Venice.He went part of the way down the Po in
a small trading ship, crowded with ladies, priests, monks, soldiers, and
a bishop.There was only one small fire on board, at which all the
cooking had to be done, and where the unhappy passengers had to keep
themselves warm as they could.At night they were confined each to a
space about three planks broad, separated from neighbours by pieces of
canvas hanging from a rope above.Each bank of the river was lined by
military posts--the left by the Austrians, and the right by the French;
and the danger of being fired into was constantly present to aggravate
the misery of overcrowding, scanty food, and bitter cold.Even this
wretchedness was surpassed by the hardships which confronted the exiles
at Venice.The physical distress endured here by De Maistre and his
unfortunate family exceeded that of any other period of their
wanderings.He was cut off from the court, and from all his relations
and friends, and reduced for the means of existence to a few fragments
of silver plate, which had somehow been saved from the universal wreck.This slender resource grew less day by day, and when that was exhausted
the prospect was a blank.The student of De Maistre's philosophy may see
in what crushing personal anguish some of its most sinister growths had
their roots.When the cares of beggary come suddenly upon a man in
middle life, they burn very deep.Alone, and starving for a cause that
is dear to him, he might encounter the grimness of fate with a fortitude
in which there should be many elevating and consoling elements.But the
destiny is intolerably hard which condemns a man of humane mould, as De
Maistre certainly was, to look helplessly on the physical pains of a
tender woman and famishing little ones.The anxieties that press upon
his heart in such calamity as this are too sharp, too tightened, and too
sordid for him to draw a single free breath, or to raise his eyes for a
single moment of relief from the monstrous perplexity that chokes him.The hour of bereavement has its bitterness, but the bitterness is
gradually suffused with soft reminiscence.The grip of beggary leaves a
mark on such a character as De Maistre's which no prosperity of after
days effaces.The seeming inhumanity of his theory of life, which is so
revolting to comfortable people like M. Villemain, was in truth the only
explanation of his own cruel sufferings in which he could find any
solace.It was not that he hated mankind, but that his destiny looked as
if God hated him, and this was a horrible moral complexity out of which
he could only extricate himself by a theory in which pain and torment
seem to stand out as the main facts in human existence.Hope smiled on him momentarily,
but, in his own words: 'It was only a flash in the night.'While he was
in Venice, the armies of Austria and Russia reconquered the north of
Italy, and Charles Emanuel IV., in the natural anticipation that the
allies would at once restore his dominions, hastened forward.Austria,
however, as De Maistre had seen long before, was indifferent or even
absolutely hostile to Sardinian interests, and she successfully opposed
Charles Emanuel's restoration.The king received the news of the perfidy
of his nominal ally at Florence, but not until after he had made
arrangements for rewarding the fidelity of some of his most loyal
adherents.It was from Florence that De Maistre received the king's nomination to
the chief place in the government of the island of Sardinia.Through the
short time of his administration here, he was overwhelmed with vexations
only a little more endurable than the physical distresses which had
weighed him down at Venice.During the war, justice had been
administered in a grossly irregular manner.Hence, people had taken the
law into their own hands, and retaliation had completed the round of
wrong-doing.The higher
class exhibited an invincible repugnance to paying their debts.Some of
these difficulties in the way of firm and orderly government were
insuperable, and De Maistre vexed his soul in an unequal and only
partially successful contest.In after years, amid the miseries of his
life in Russia, he wrote to his brother thus: 'Sometimes in moments of
solitude that I multiply as much as I possibly can, I throw my head back
on the cushion of my sofa, and there with my four walls around me, far
from all that is dear to me, confronted by a sombre and impenetrable
future, I recall the days when in a little town that you know well'--he
meant Cagliari--'with my head resting on another sofa, and only seeing
around our own exclusive circle (good heavens, what an impertinence!)little men and little things, I used to ask myself: "Am I then condemned
to live and die in this place, like a limpet on a rock?"I suffered
bitterly; my head was overloaded, wearied, flattened, by the enormous
weight of Nothing.'In 1802 he received an order
from the king to proceed to St.Petersburg as envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary at the court of Russia.Even from this bitter
proof of devotion to his sovereign he did not shrink.He had to tear
himself from his wife and children, without any certainty when so cruel
a separation would be likely to end; to take up new functions which the
circumstances of the time rendered excessively difficult; while the
petty importance of the power he represented, and its mendicant attitude
in Europe, robbed his position of that public distinction and dignity
which may richly console a man for the severest private sacrifice.It is
a kind destiny which veils their future from mortal men.Fifteen years
passed before De Maistre's exile came to a close.From 1802 to 1817 he
did not quit the inhospitable latitudes of northern Russia.De Maistre's letters during this desolate period furnish a striking
picture of his manner of life and his mental state.We see in them his
most prominent characteristics strongly marked.Not even the
painfulness of the writer's situation ever clouds his intrepid and
vigorous spirit.Lively and gallant sallies of humour to his female
friends, sagacious judgments on the position of Europe to political
people, bits of learned criticism for erudite people, tender and playful
chat with his two daughters, all these alternate with one another with
the most delightful effect.Whether he is writing to his little girl
whom he has never known, or to the king of Sardinia, or to some author
who sends him a book, or to a minister who has found fault with his
diplomacy, there is in all alike the same constant and remarkable play
of a bright and penetrating intellectual light, coloured by a humour
that is now and then a little sardonic, but more often is genial and
lambent.There is a certain semi-latent quality of hardness lying at the
bottom of De Maistre's style, both in his letters and in his more
elaborate compositions.His writings seem to recall the flavour and
bouquet of some of the fortifying and stimulating wines of Burgundy,
from which time and warmth have not yet drawn out a certain native
roughness that lingers on the palate.This hardness, if one must give
the quality a name that only imperfectly describes it, sprang not from
any original want of impressionableness or sensibility of nature, but
partly from the relentless buffetings which he had to endure at the
hands of fortune, and partly from the preponderance which had been given
to the rational side of his mind by long habits of sedulous and accurate
study.Few men knew so perfectly as he knew how to be touching without
ceasing to be masculine, nor how to go down into the dark pits of human
life without forgetting the broad sunlight, nor how to keep habitually
close to visible and palpable fact while eagerly addicted to
speculation.His contemplations were perhaps somewhat too near the
ground; they led him into none of those sublimer regions of subtle
feeling where the rarest human spirits have loved to travel; we do not
think of his mind among those who have gone

    Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.If this kind of temper, strong, keen, frank, and a little hard and
mordent, brought him too near a mischievous disbelief in the dignity of
men and their lives, at least it kept him well away from morbid weakness
in ethics, and from beating the winds in metaphysics.But of this we
shall see more in considering his public pieces than can be gathered
from his letters.The discomforts of De Maistre's life at St.The
dignity of his official style and title was an aggravation of the
exceeding straitness of his means.The ruined master could do little to
mitigate the ruin of his servant.He had to keep up the appearance of an
ambassador on the salary of a clerk.'This is the second winter,' he
writes to his brother in 1810, 'that I have gone through without a
pelisse, which is exactly like going without a shirt at Cagliari.When I
come from court a very sorry lackey throws a common cloak over my
shoulders.'The climate suited him better than he had expected; and in
one letter he vows that he was the only living being in Russia who had
passed two winters without fur boots and a fur hat.It was considered
indispensable that he should keep a couple of servants; so, for his
second, De Maistre was obliged to put up with a thief, whom he rescued
under the shelter of ambassadorial privilege from the hands of justice,
on condition that he would turn honest.The Austrian ambassador, with
whom he was on good terms, would often call to take him out to some
entertainment.'His fine servants mount my staircase groping their way
in the dark, and we descend preceded by a servant carrying _luminare
minus quam ut praeesset nocti_.''I am certain,' he adds pleasantly,
'that they make songs about me in their Austrian patois.Sometimes he was reduced so far as to share the soup of his valet, for
lack of richer and more independent fare.Then he was constantly fretted
by enemies at home, who disliked his trenchant diplomacy, and distrusted
the strength and independence of a mind which was too vigorous to please
the old-fashioned ministers of the Sardinian court.These chagrins he
took as a wise man should.They disturbed him less than his separation
from his family.'Six hundred leagues away from you all,' he writes to
his brother, 'the thoughts of my family, the reminiscences of childhood,
transport me with sadness.'Visions of his mother's saintly face
haunted his chamber; almost gloomier still was the recollection of old
intimates with whom he had played, lived, argued, and worked for years,
and yet who now no longer bore him in mind.There are not many glimpses
of this melancholy in the letters meant for the eye of his beloved
_trinite feminine_, as he playfully called his wife and two daughters.'_A quoi bon vous attrister_,' he asked bravely, '_sans raison et sans
profit?_' Occasionally he cannot help letting out to them how far his
mind is removed from composure.'Every day as I return home I found my
house as desolate as if it was yesterday you left me.In society the
same fancy pursues me, and scarcely ever quits me.'Music, as might be
surmised in so sensitive a nature, drove him almost beside himself with
its mysterious power of intensifying the dominant emotion.'Whenever by
any chance I hear the harpsichord,' he says,'melancholy seizes me.The
sound of the violin gives me such a heavy heart, that I am fain to leave
the company and hasten home.'He tossed in his bed at night, thinking he
heard the sound of weeping at Turin, making a thousand efforts to
picture to himself the looks of that 'orphan child of a living father'
whom he had never known, wondering if ever he should know her, and
battling with a myriad of black phantoms that seemed to rustle in his
curtains.'But you, M. de Chevalier,' he said apologetically to the
correspondent to whom he told these dismal things, 'you are a father,
you know the cruel dreams of a waking man; if you were not of the
profession I would not allow my pen to write you this jeremiad.'As De
Maistre was accustomed to think himself happy if he got three hours'
sound sleep in the night, these sombre and terrible vigils were ample
enough to excuse him if he had allowed them to overshadow all other
things.But the vigour of his intellect was too strenuous, and his
curiosity and interest in every object of knowledge too
inextinguishable.'After all,' he said, 'the only thing to do is to put
on a good face, and to march to the place of torture with a few friends
to console you on the way.This is the charming image under which I
picture my present situation.Mark you,' he added, 'I always count books
among one's consoling friends.'In one of the most gay and charming of his letters, apologising to a
lady for the remissness of his correspondence, he explains that
diplomacy and books occupy every moment.'You will admit, madam, there
is no possibility of one's shutting up books entirely.Nay, more than
ever, I feel myself burning with the feverish thirst for knowledge.I
have had an access of it which I cannot describe to you.The most
curious books literally run after me, and hurry voluntarily to place
themselves in my hands.As soon as diplomacy gives me a moment of
breathing-time I rush headlong to that favourite pasture, to that
ambrosia of which the mind can never have enough--

    _Et voila ce qui fait que votre ami est muet._'

He thinks himself happy if, by refusing invitations to dinner, he can
pass a whole day without stirring from his house.'I read, I write, I
study; for after all one must know something.'In his hours of
depression he fancied that he only read and worked, not for the sake of
the knowledge, but to stupefy and tire himself out, if that were
possible.As a student De Maistre was indefatigable.He never belonged to that
languid band who hoped to learn difficult things by easy methods.The
only way, he warned his son, is to shut your door, to say that you are
not within, and to work.'Since they have set themselves to teach us how
we ought to learn the dead languages, you can find nobody who knows
them; and it is amusing enough that people who don't know them, should
be so obstinately bent on demonstrating the vices of the methods
employed by us who do know them.'He was one of those wise and laborious
students who do not read without a pen in their hands.He never shrank
from the useful toil of transcribing abundantly from all the books he
read everything that could by any possibility eventually be of service
to him in his inquiries.As soon as one of
them was filled, he carefully made up an index of its contents, numbered
it, and placed it on a shelf with its unforgotten predecessors.In one
place he accidentally mentions that he had some thirty of these folios
over the head of his writing-table.'If I am a pedant at home,' he said, 'at least I am as little as
possible a pedant out of doors.'In the evening he would occasionally
seek the society of ladies, by way of recovering some of that native
gaiety of heart which had hitherto kept him alive.'I blow on this
spark,' to use his own words, 'just as an old woman blows among the
ashes to get a light for her lamp.'A student and a thinker, De Maistre
was also a man of the world, and he may be added to the long list of
writers who have shown that to take an active part in public affairs and
mix in society give a peculiar life, reality, and force to both
scholarship and speculation.It was computed at that time that the
author of a philosophic piece could not safely count upon more than a
hundred and fifty readers in Russia; and hence, we might be sure, even
if we had not De Maistre's word for it, that away from his own house he
left his philosophy behind.The vehemence of his own convictions did not
prevent him from being socially tolerant to others who hated them.'If I
had the good fortune to be among his acquaintances,' he wrote of a
heretical assailant, 'he would see that among the people with
convictions it would be hard to find one so free from prejudice as I am.I have many friends among the Protestants, and now that their system is
tottering, they are all the dearer to me.'In spite of his scanty means,
his shabby valet, his threadbare cloak, and the humbleness of his
diplomatic position, the fire and honesty of his character combined with
his known ability to place him high in the esteem of the society of St.His fidelity, devotion, and fortitude, mellowed by many
years and by meditative habits, and tinged perhaps by the patrician
consciousness of birth, formed in him a modest dignity of manner which
men respected.They perceived it to be no artificial assumption, but the
outward image of a lofty and self-respecting spirit.His brother
diplomatists, even the representatives of France, appear to have treated
him with marked consideration.His letters prove him to have been a
favourite among ladies.The Emperor Alexander showed him considerable
kindness of the cheap royal sort.He conferred on his brother, Xavier de
Maistre, a post in one of the public museums, while to the Sardinian
envoy's son he gave a commission in the Russian service.The first departure of this son for the campaign of 1807 occasioned some
of the most charming passages in De Maistre's letters, both to the young
soldier himself and to others.For though without a touch of morbid
expansiveness, he never denied himself the solace of opening his heart
to a trusted friend, and a just reserve with strangers did not hinder a
humane and manly confidence with intimates.'This morning,' he wrote to
his stripling, soon after he had joined the army, 'I felt a tightening
at my heart when a pet dog came running in and jumped upon your bed,
where he finds you no more.He soon perceived his mistake, and said
clearly enough, after his own fashion: _I am mistaken; where can he be
then?_ As for me I have felt all that you will feel, if ever you pursue
this mighty trade of being a father.'And then he begs of his son if he
should find himself with a tape line in his hand, that he will take his
exact measure and forward it.Soon came the news of the battle of
Friedland, and the unhappy father thought he read the fate of his son in
the face of every acquaintance he met.And so it was in later campaigns,
as De Maistre records in correspondence that glows with tender and
healthy solicitude.All this is worth dwelling upon, for two reasons.First, because De Maistre has been too much regarded and spoken of as a
man of cold sensibility, and little moved by the hardships which fill
the destiny of our unfortunate race.And, secondly, because his own keen
acquaintance with mental anguish helps us to understand the zeal with
which he attempts to reconcile the blind cruelty and pain and torture
endured by mortals with the benignity and wisdom of the immortal.'After
all,' he used to say, 'there are only two real evils--remorse and
disease.'This is true enough for an apophthegm, but as a matter of fact
it never for an instant dulled his sensibility to far less supreme forms
of agony than the recollection of irreparable pain struck into the lives
of others.It is interesting and suggestive to recall how a later
publicist viewed the ills that dwarf our little lives.'If I were asked
to class human miseries,' said Tocqueville, 'I would do so in this
order: first, Disease; second, Death; third, Doubt.'At a later date, he
altered the order, and deliberately declared doubt to be the most
insupportable of all evils, worse than death itself.But Tocqueville was
an aristocrat, as Guizot once told him, who accepted his defeat.He
stood on the brink of the great torrent of democracy, and shivered.De
Maistre was an aristocrat too, but he was incapable of knowing what
doubt or hesitation meant.He never dreamt that his cause was lost, and
he mocked and defied the Revolution to the end.We easily see how
natures of this sort, ardent, impetuous, unflinching, find themselves in
the triumphant paths that lead to remorse at their close, and how they
thus come to feel remorse rather than doubt as the consummate agony of
the human mind.Having had this glimpse of De Maistre's character away from his books,
we need not linger long over the remaining events of his life.In 1814
his wife and two daughters joined him in the Russian capital.Two years
later an outburst of religious fanaticism caused the sudden expulsion of
the Jesuits from Russia, to De Maistre's deep mortification.Several
conversions had taken place from the Orthodox to the Western faith, and
these inflamed the Orthodox party, headed by the Prince de Galitzin, the
minister of public worship, with violent theological fury.De Maistre,
whose intense attachment to his own creed was well known, fell under
suspicion of having connived at these conversions, and the Emperor
himself went so far as to question him.'I told him,' De Maistre says,
'that I had never changed the faith of any of his subjects, but that if
any of them had by chance made me a sharer of their confidence, neither
honour nor conscience would have allowed me to tell them that they were
wrong.'This kind of dialogue between a sovereign and an ambassador
implied a situation plainly unfavourable to effective diplomacy.The
envoy obtained his recall, and after twenty-five years' absence returned
to his native country (1817).On his way home, it may be noticed, De
Maistre passed a few days in Paris, and thus, for the first and last
time, one of the most eminent of modern French writers found himself on
French soil.The king accorded De Maistre an honourable reception, conferred upon him
a high office and a small sum of money, and lent his ear to other
counsellors.The philosopher, though insisting on declaring his
political opinions, then, as ever, unwaveringly anti-revolutionary,
threw himself mainly upon that literary composition which had been his
solace in yet more evil days than these.It was at this time that he
gave to the world the supreme fruit of nearly half a century of study,
meditation, and contact with the world, in _Du Pape_, _Les Soirees de
Saint Petersbourg_, and _L'Eglise Gallicane_.Their author did not live
long to enjoy the vast discussion which they occasioned, nor the
reputation that they have since conferred upon his name.He died in
February 1821 after such a life as we have seen.FOOTNOTE:

[2] The facts of De Maistre's life I have drawn from a very meagre
biography by his son, Count Rodolphe de Maistre, supplemented by two
volumes of _Lettres et Opuscules_ (Fourth edition.1865),
and a volume of his _Diplomatic Correspondence_, edited by M. Albert
Blanc.It is not at all surprising that they upon whom the revolutionary deluge
came should have looked with indiscriminating horror and affright on all
the influences which in their view had united first to gather up, and
then to release the destructive flood.The eighteenth century to men
like De Maistre seemed an infamous parenthesis, mysteriously interposed
between the glorious age of Bossuet and Fenelon, and that yet brighter
era for faith and the Church which was still to come in the good time of
Divine Providence.The philosophy of the last century, he says on more
than one occasion, will form one of the most shameful epochs of the
human mind: it never praised even good men except for what was bad in
them.He looked upon the gods whom that century had worshipped as the
direct authors of the bloodshed and ruin in which their epoch had
closed.The memory of mild and humane philosophers was covered with the
kind of black execration that prophets of old had hurled at Baal or
Moloch; Locke and Hume, Voltaire and Rousseau, were habitually spoken of
as very scourges of God.From this temper two consequences naturally
flowed.In the first place, while it lasted there was no hope of an
honest philosophic discussion of the great questions which divide
speculative minds.Moderation and impartiality were virtues of almost
superhuman difficulty for controversialists who had made up their minds
that it was their opponents who had erected the guillotine, confiscated
the sacred property of the church, slaughtered and banished her
children, and filled the land with terror and confusion.It is hard amid
the smoking ruins of the homestead to do full justice to the theoretical
arguments of the supposed authors of the conflagration.Hence De
Maistre, though, as has been already said, intimately acquainted with
the works of his foes in the letter, was prevented by the vehemence of
his antipathy to the effects which he attributed to them, from having
any just critical estimate of their value and true spirit.'I do not
know one of these men,' he says of the philosophers of the eighteenth
century, 'to whom the sacred title of honest man is quite suitable.'Their very names '_me dechirent la
bouche_.'To admire Voltaire is the sign of a corrupt soul; and if
anybody is drawn to the works of Voltaire, then be sure that God does
not love such an one.The divine anathema is written on the very face of
this arch-blasphemer; on his shameless brow, in the two extinct craters
still sparkling with sensuality and hate, in that frightful _rictus_
running from ear to ear, in those lips tightened by cruel malice, like a
spring ready to fly back and launch forth blasphemy and sarcasm; he
plunges into the mud, rolls in it, drinks of it; he surrenders his
imagination to the enthusiasm of hell, which lends him all its forces;
Paris crowned him, Sodom would have banished him.[3] Locke, again, did
not understand himself.His distinguishing characteristics are
feebleness and precipitancy of judgment.Vagueness and irresolution
reign in his expressions as they do in his thoughts.He constantly
exhibits that most decisive sign of mediocrity--he passes close by the
greatest questions without perceiving them.In the study of philosophy,
contempt for Locke is the beginning of knowledge.[4] Condillac was even
more vigilantly than anybody else on his guard against his own
conscience.But Hume was perhaps the most dangerous and the most guilty
of all those mournful writers who will for ever accuse the last century
before posterity--the one who employed the most talent with the most
coolness to do most harm.[5] To Bacon De Maistre paid the compliment of
composing a long refutation of his main ideas, in which Bacon's
blindness, presumption, profanity, and scientific charlatanry are
denounced in vehement and almost coarse terms, and treated as the
natural outcome of a low morality.It has long been the inglorious speciality of the theological school to
insist in this way upon moral depravity as an antecedent condition of
intellectual error.De Maistre in this respect was not unworthy of his
fellows.He believed that his opponents were even worse citizens than
they were bad philosophers, and it was his horror of them in the former
capacity that made him so bitter and resentful against them in the
latter.He could think of no more fitting image for opinions that he did
not happen to believe than counterfeit money, 'which is struck in the
first instance by great criminals, and is afterwards passed on by honest
folk who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they do.'A
philosopher of the highest class, we may be sure, does not permit
himself to be drawn down from the true object of his meditations by
these sinister emotions.But De Maistre belonged emphatically to minds
of the second order, whose eagerness to find truth is never intense and
pure enough to raise them above perturbing antipathies to persons.His
whole attitude was fatal to his claim to be heard as a truth-seeker in
any right sense of the term.He was not only persuaded of the general
justice and inexpugnableness of the orthodox system, but he refused to
believe that it was capable of being improved or supplemented by
anything which a temperate and fair examination of other doctrines might
peradventure be found to yield.With De Maistre there was no
peradventure.Again, no speculative mind of the highest order ever
mistakes, or ever moves systematically apart from, the main current of
the social movement of its time.It is implied in the very definition of
a thinker of supreme quality that he should detect, and be in a certain
accord with, the most forward and central of the ruling tendencies of
his epoch.Three-quarters of a century have elapsed since De Maistre was
driven to attempt to explain the world to himself, and this interval
has sufficed to show that the central conditions at that time for the
permanent reorganisation of the society which had just been so violently
rent in pieces, were assuredly not theological, military, nor
ultramontane, but the very opposite of all these.There was a second consequence of the conditions of the time.The
catastrophe of Europe affected the matter as well as the manner of
contemporary speculation.The French Revolution has become to us no more
than a term, though the strangest term in a historic series.To some of
the best of those who were confronted on every side by its tumult and
agitation, it was the prevailing of the gates of hell, the moral
disruption of the universe, the absolute and total surrender of the
world to them that plough iniquity and sow wickedness.Even under
ordinary circumstances few men have gone through life without
encountering some triumphant iniquity, some gross and prolonged cruelty,
which makes them wonder how God should allow such things to be.If we
remember the aspect which the Revolution wore in the eyes of those who
seeing it yet did not understand, we can imagine what dimensions this
eternal enigma must have assumed in their sight.It was inevitable that
the first problem to press on men with resistless urgency should be the
ancient question of the method of the Creator's temporal government.What is the law of the distribution of good and evil fortune?How can we
vindicate with regard to the conditions of this life, the different
destinies that fall to men?How can we defend the moral ordering of a
world in which the wicked and godless constantly triumph, while the
virtuous and upright who retain their integrity are as frequently
buffeted and put to shame?This tremendous question has never been presented with such sublimity of
expression, such noble simplicity and force of thought, as in the
majestic and touching legend of Job.But its completeness, as a
presentation of the human tragedy, is impaired by the excessive
prosperity which is finally supposed to reward the patient hero for his
fortitude.Job received twice as much as he had before, and his latter
end was blessed more than his beginning.In the chronicles of actual
history men fare not so.There is a terribly logical finish about some
of the dealings of fate, and in life the working of a curse is seldom
stayed by any dramatic necessity for a smooth consummation.No statement of
the case is adequate which maintains, by ever so delicate an
implication, that in the long run and somehow it is well in temporal
things with the just, and ill with the unjust.Until we have firmly
looked in the face the grim truth that temporal rewards and punishments
do not follow the possession or the want of spiritual or moral virtue,
so long we are still ignorant what that enigma is, which speculative
men, from the author of the book of Job downwards, have striven to
resolve.We can readily imagine the fulness with which the question
would grow up in the mind of a royalist and Catholic exile at the end of
the eighteenth century.Nothing can be more clearly put than De Maistre's answers to the
question which the circumstances of the time placed before him to solve.What is the law of the distribution of good and evil fortune in this
life?Do prosperity and adversity fall respectively
to the just and the unjust, either individually or collectively?Has the
ancient covenant been faithfully kept, that whoso hearkens diligently to
the divine voice, and observes all the commandments to do them, shall be
blessed in his basket and his store and in all the work of his hand?Or
is God a God that hideth himself?De Maistre perceived that the optimistic conception of the deity as
benign, merciful, infinitely forgiving, was very far indeed from
covering the facts.So he insisted on seeing in human destiny the
ever-present hand of a stern and terrible judge, administering a
Draconian code with blind and pitiless severity.God created men under
conditions which left them free to choose between good and evil.All the
physical evil that exists in the world is a penalty for the moral evil
that has resulted from the abuse by men of this freedom of choice.For
these physical calamities God is only responsible in the way in which a
criminal judge is responsible for a hanging.Men cannot blame the judge
for the gallows; the fault is their own in committing those offences for
which hanging is prescribed beforehand as the penalty.These curses
which dominate human life are not the result of the cruelty of the
divine ruler, but of the folly and wickedness of mankind, who, seeing
the better course, yet deliberately choose the worse.The order of the
world is overthrown by the iniquities of men; it is we who have provoked
the exercise of the divine justice, and called down the tokens of his
vengeance.The misery and disaster that surround us like a cloak are the
penalty of our crimes and the price of our expiation.Thomas has said: _Deus est auctor mali quod est poena, non autem mali
quod est culpa._ There is a certain quantity of wrong done over the face
of the world; therefore the great Judge exacts a proportionate quantity
of punishment.The total amount of evil suffered makes nice equation
with the total amount of evil done; the extent of human suffering
tallies precisely with the extent of human guilt.Of course you must
take original sin into account, 'which explains all, and without which
you can explain nothing.''In virtue of this primitive degradation we
are subject to all sorts of physical sufferings _in general_; just as in
virtue of this same degradation we are subject to all sorts of vices _in
general_.This original malady therefore [which is the correlative of
original sin] has no other name.It is only the capacity of suffering
all evils, as original sin is only the capacity of committing all
crimes.'[6] Hence all calamity is either the punishment of sins actually
committed by the sufferers, or else it is the general penalty exacted
for general sinfulness.Sometimes an innocent being is stricken, and a
guilty being appears to escape.But is it not the same in the
transactions of earthly tribunals?And yet we do not say that they are
conducted without regard to justice and righteousness.'When God
punishes any society for the crimes that it has committed, he does
justice as we do justice ourselves in these sorts of circumstance.A
city revolts; it massacres the representatives of the sovereign; it
shuts its gates against him; it defends itself against his arms; it is
taken.The prince has it dismantled and deprived of all its privileges;
nobody will find fault with this decision on the ground that there are
innocent persons shut up in the city.'[7]

De Maistre's deity is thus a colossal Septembriseur, enthroned high in
the peaceful heavens, demanding ever-renewed holocausts in the name of
the public safety.It is true, as a general rule of the human mind, that the objects which
men have worshipped have improved in morality and wisdom as men
themselves have improved.The quiet gods, without effort of their own,
have grown holier and purer by the agitations and toil which civilise
their worshippers.In other words, the same influences which elevate and
widen our sense of human duty give corresponding height and nobleness to
our ideas of the divine character.The history of the civilisation of
the earth is the history of the civilisation of Olympus also.It will be
seen that the deity whom De Maistre sets up is below the moral level of
the time in respect of Punishment.In intellectual matters he vehemently
proclaimed the superiority of the tenth or the twelfth over the
eighteenth century, but it is surely carrying admiration for those loyal
times indecently far, to seek in the vindictive sackings of revolted
towns, and the miscellaneous butcheries of men, women, and babes, which
then marked the vengeance of outraged sovereignty, the most apt parallel
and analogy for the systematic administration of human society by its
Creator.Such punishment can no longer be regarded as moral in any deep
or permanent sense; it implies a gross, harsh, and revengeful character
in the executioner, that is eminently perplexing and incredible to those
who expect to find an idea of justice in the government of the world, at
least not materially below what is attained in the clumsy efforts of
uninspired publicists.In mere point of administration, the criminal code which De Maistre put
into the hands of the Supreme Being works in a more arbitrary and
capricious manner than any device of an Italian Bourbon.As Voltaire
asks--

    _Lisbonne, qui n'est plus, eut-elle plus de vices
    Que Londres, que Paris, plonges dans les delices?Lisbonne est abimee, et l'on danse a Paris._


Stay, De Maistre replies, look at Paris thirty years later, not dancing,
but red with blood.This kind of thing is often said, even now; but it
is really time to abandon the prostitution of the name of Justice to a
process which brings Lewis XVI.to the block, and consigns De Maistre to
poverty and exile, because Lewis XIV., the Regent, and Lewis XV.had
been profligate men or injudicious rulers.The reader may remember how
the unhappy Emperor Maurice as his five innocent sons were in turn
murdered before his eyes, at each stroke piously ejaculated: 'Thou art
just, O Lord!'[8] Any name would befit
this kind of transaction better than that which, in the dealings of men
with one another at least, we reserve for the honourable anxiety that he
should reap who has sown, that the reward should be to him who has
toiled for it, and the pain to him who has deliberately incurred it.What is gained by attributing to the divine government a method tainted
with every quality that could vitiate the enactment of penalties by a
temporal sovereign?We need not labour this part of the discussion further.Though conducted
with much brilliance and vigour by De Maistre, it is not his most
important nor remarkable contribution to thought.Before passing on to
that, it is worth while to make one remark.It will be inferred from De
Maistre's general position that he was no friend to physical science.Just as moderns see in the advance of the methods and boundaries of
physical knowledge the most direct and sure means of displacing the
unfruitful subjective methods of old, and so of renovating the entire
field of human thought and activity, so did De Maistre see, as his
school has seen since, that here was the stronghold of his foes.'Ah,
how dearly,' he exclaimed, 'has man paid for the natural sciences!'Not
but that Providence designed that man should know something about them;
only it must be in due order.The ancients were not permitted to attain
to much or even any sound knowledge of physics, indisputably above us as
they were in force of mind, a fact shown by the superiority of their
languages which ought to silence for ever the voice of our modern pride.Why did the ancients remain so ignorant of natural science?'When all Europe was Christian, when the priests
were the universal teachers, when all the establishments of Europe were
Christianised, when theology had taken its place at the head of all
instruction, and the other faculties were ranged around her like maids
of honour round their queen, the human race being thus prepared, then
the natural sciences were given to it.'Science must be kept in its
place, for it resembles fire which, when confined in the grates prepared
for it, is the most useful and powerful of man's servants; scattered
about anyhow, it is the most terrible of scourges.Whence the marked
supremacy of the seventeenth century, especially in France?From the
happy accord of religion, science, and chivalry, and from the supremacy
conceded to the first.The more perfect theology is in a country the
more fruitful it is in true science; and that is why Christian nations
have surpassed all others in the sciences, and that is why the Indians
and Chinese will never reach us, so long as we remain respectively as we
are.The more theology is cultivated, honoured, and supreme, then, other
things being equal, the more perfect will human science be: that is to
say, it will have the greater force and expansion, and will be the more
free from every mischievous and perilous connection.[9]

Little would be gained here by serious criticism of a view of this kind
from a positive point.How little, the reader will understand from De
Maistre's own explanations of his principles of Proof and Evidence.'They have called to witness against Moses,' he says, 'history,
chronology, astronomy, geology, etc.The objections have disappeared
before true science; but those were profoundly wise who despised them
before any inquiry, or who only examined them in order to discover a
refutation, but without ever doubting that there was one.Even a
mathematical objection ought to be despised, for though it may be a
demonstrated truth, still you will never be able to demonstrate that it
contradicts a truth that has been demonstrated before.'His final
formula he boldly announced in these words: '_Que toutes les fois qu'une
proposition sera prouvee par le genre de preuve qui lui appartient,
l'objection quelconque,_ MEME INSOLUBLE, _ne doit plus etre ecoutee._'
Suppose, for example, that by a consensus of testimony it were perfectly
proved that Archimedes set fire to the fleet of Marcellus by a
burning-glass; then all the objections of geometry disappear.Prove if
you can, and if you choose, that by certain laws a glass, in order to be
capable of setting fire to the Roman fleet, must have been as big as the
whole city of Syracuse, and ask me what answer I have to make to that.'_J'ai a vous repondre qu'Archimede brula la flotte romaine avec un
miroir ardent._'

The interesting thing about such opinions as these is not the exact
height and depth of their falseness, but the considerations which could
recommend them to a man of so much knowledge, both of books and of the
outer facts of life, and of so much natural acuteness as De Maistre.Persons who have accustomed themselves to ascertained methods of proof,
are apt to look on a man who vows that if a thing has been declared
true by some authority whom he respects, then that constitutes proof to
him, as either the victim of a preposterous and barely credible
infatuation, or else as a flat impostor.Yet De Maistre was no ignorant
monk.He had no selfish or official interest in taking away the
keys of knowledge, entering not in himself, and them that would
enter in hindering.The true reasons for his detestation of the
eighteenth-century philosophers, science, and literature, are simple
enough.Like every wise man, he felt that the end of all philosophy and
science is emphatically social, the construction and maintenance and
improvement of a fabric under which the communities of men may find
shelter, and may secure all the conditions for living their lives with
dignity and service.Then he held that no truth can be harmful to
society.If he found any system of opinions, any given attitude of the
mind, injurious to tranquillity and the public order, he instantly
concluded that, however plausible they might seem when tested by logic
and demonstration, they were fundamentally untrue and deceptive.What is
logic compared with eternal salvation in the next world, and the
practice of virtue in this?The recommendation of such a mind as De
Maistre's is the intensity of its appreciation of order and social
happiness.The obvious weakness of such a mind, and the curse inherent
in its influence, is that it overlooks the prime condition of all; that
social order can never be established on a durable basis so long as the
discoveries of scientific truth in all its departments are suppressed,
or incorrectly appreciated, or socially misapplied.De Maistre did not
perceive that the cause which he supported was no longer the cause of
peace and tranquillity and right living, but was in a state of absolute
and final decomposition, and therefore was the cause of disorder and
blind wrong living.FOOTNOTES:

[7] De Maistre found a curiously characteristic kind of support for this
view in the fact that evils are called _fleaux_: flails are things to
beat with: so evils must be things with which men are beaten; and as we
should not be beaten if we did not deserve it, _argal_, suffering is a
merited punishment.Apart from that common infirmity which leads people
after they have discovered an analogy between two things, to argue from
the properties of the one to those of the other, as if, instead of being
analogous, they were identical, De Maistre was particularly fond of
inferring moral truths from etymologies.He has an argument for the
deterioration of man, drawn from the fact that the Romans expressed in
the same word, _supplicium_, the two ideas of prayer and punishment
(_Soirees, 2ieme entretien_, i. p.His profundity as an
etymologist may be gathered from his analysis of _cadaver_: _ca_-ro,
_da_-ta, _ver_-mibus.[8] _Gibbon_, c. xlvi.[9] See the _Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon_, vol.58 _et seq._




III.When the waters of the deluge of '89 began to assuage, the best minds
soon satisfied themselves that the event which Bonaparte's restoration
of order enabled them to look back upon with a certain tranquillity and
a certain completeness, had been neither more nor less than a new
irruption of barbarians into the European world.The monarchy, the
nobles, and the Church, with all the ideas that gave each of them life
and power, had fallen before atheists and Jacobins, as the ancient
empire of Rome had fallen before Huns and Goths, Vandals and Lombards.The leaders of the revolution had succeeded one another, as Attila had
come after Alaric, and as Genseric had been followed by Odoacer.The
problem which presented itself was not new in the history of western
civilisation; the same dissolution of old bonds which perplexed the
foremost men at the beginning of the nineteenth century, had distracted
their predecessors from the fifth to the eighth, though their conditions
and circumstances were widely different.The practical question in both
cases was just the same--how to establish a stable social order which,
resting on principles that should command the assent of all, might
secure the co-operation of all for its harmonious and efficient
maintenance, and might offer a firm basis for the highest and best life
that the moral and intellectual state of the time allowed.There were
two courses open, or which seemed to be open, in this gigantic
enterprise of reconstructing a society.One of them was to treat the
case of the eighteenth century as if it were not merely similar to, but
exactly identical with, the case of the fifth, and as if exactly the
same forces which had knit Western Europe together into a compact
civilisation a thousand years before, would again suffice for a second
consolidation.Christianity, rising with the zeal and strength of youth
out of the ruins of the Empire, and feudalism by the need of
self-preservation imposing a form upon the unshapen associations of the
barbarians, had between them compacted the foundations and reared the
fabric of mediaeval life.Why, many men asked themselves, should not
Christian and feudal ideas repeat their great achievement, and be the
means of reorganising the system which a blind rebellion against them
had thrown into deplorable and fatal confusion?Let the century which
had come to such an end be regarded as a mysteriously intercalated
episode, and no more, in the long drama of faith and sovereign order.Let it pass as a sombre and pestilent stream, whose fountains no man
should discover, whose waters had for a season mingled with the mightier
current of the divinely allotted destiny of the race, and had then
gathered themselves apart and flowed off, to end as they had begun, in
the stagnation and barrenness of the desert.Philosophers and men of
letters, astronomers and chemists, atheists and republicans, had shown
that they were only powerful to destroy, as the Goths and the Vandals
had been.They had shown that they were impotent, as the Goths and the
Vandals had been, in building up again.Let men turn their faces, then,
once more to that system by which in the ancient times Europe had been
delivered from a relapse into eternal night.The minds to whom it
commended itself were cast in a different mould and drew their
inspiration from other traditions.In their view the system which the
Church had been the main agency in organising, had fallen quite as much
from its own irremediable weakness as from the direct onslaughts of
assailants within and without.The barbarians had rushed in, it was
true, in 1793; but this time it was the Church and feudalism which were
in the position of the old empire on whose ruins they had built.What
had once restored order and belief to the West, was now in its own turn
overtaken by decay and dissolution.To look to them to unite these new
barbarians in a stable and vigorous civilisation, because they had
organised Europe of old, was as infatuated as it would have been to
expect the later emperors to equal the exploits of the Republic and
their greatest predecessors in the purple.To despise philosophers and
men of science was only to play over again in a new dress the very part
which Julian had enacted in the face of nascent Christianity.The
eighteenth century, instead of being that home of malaria which the
Catholic and Royalist party represented, was in truth the seed-ground of
a new and better future.Its ideas were to furnish the material and the
implements by which should be repaired the terrible breaches and chasms
in European order that had been made alike by despots and Jacobins, by
priests and atheists, by aristocrats and sans-culottes.Amidst all the
demolition upon which its leading minds had been so zealously bent, they
had been animated by the warmest love of social justice, of human
freedom, of equal rights, and by the most fervent and sincere longing to
make a nobler happiness more universally attainable by all the children
of men.It was to these great principles that we ought eagerly to turn,
to liberty, to equality, to brotherhood, if we wished to achieve before
the new invaders a work of civilisation and social reconstruction, such
as Catholicism and feudalism had achieved for the multitudinous invaders
of old.Such was the difference which divided opinion when men took heart to
survey the appalling scene of moral desolation that the cataclysm of '93
had left behind.For if the
conscience of the Liberals was oppressed by the sanguinary tragedy in
which freedom and brotherhood and justice had been consummated, the
Catholic and the Royalist were just as sorely burdened with the weight
of kingly basenesses and priestly hypocrisies.If the one had some
difficulty in interpreting Jacobinism and the Terror, the other was
still more severely pressed to interpret the fact and origin and meaning
of the Revolution; if the Liberal had Marat and Hebert, the Royalist had
Lewis XV., and the Catholic had Dubois and De Rohan.Each school could
intrepidly hurl back the taunts of its enemy, and neither of them did
full justice to the strong side of the other.Yet we who are, in England
at all events, removed a little aside from the centre of this great
battle, may perceive that at that time both of the contending hosts
fought under honourable banners, and could inscribe upon their shields a
rational and intelligible device.Indeed, unless the modern Liberal
admits the strength inherent in the cause of his enemies, it is
impossible for him to explain to himself the duration and obstinacy of
the conflict, the slow advance and occasional repulse of the host in
which he has enlisted, and the tardy progress that Liberalism has made
in that stupendous reconstruction which the Revolution has forced the
modern political thinker to meditate upon, and the modern statesman to
further and control.De Maistre, from those general ideas as to the method of the government
of the world, of which we have already seen something, had formed what
he conceived to be a perfectly satisfactory way of accounting for the
eighteenth century and its terrific climax.The will of man is left
free; he acts contrary to the will of God; and then God exacts the
shedding of blood as the penalty.The only hope of
the future lay in an immediate return to the system which God himself
had established, and in the restoration of that spiritual power which
had presided over the reconstruction of Europe in darker and more
chaotic times than even these.Though, perhaps, he nowhere expresses
himself on this point in a distinct formula, De Maistre was firmly
impressed with the idea of historic unity and continuity.He looked upon
the history of the West in its integrity, and was entirely free from
anything like that disastrous kind of misconception which makes the
English Protestant treat the long period between St.Paul and Martin
Luther as a howling waste, or which makes some Americans omit from all
account the still longer period of human effort from the crucifixion of
Christ to the Declaration of Independence.The rise of the vast
structure of Western civilisation during and after the dissolution of
the Empire, presented itself to his mind as a single and uniform
process, though marked in portions by temporary, casual, parenthetical
interruptions, due to depraved will and disordered pride.All the
dangers to which this civilisation had been exposed in its infancy and
growth were before his eyes.First, there were the heresies with which
the subtle and debased ingenuity of the Greeks had stained and distorted
the great but simple mysteries of the faith.Then came the hordes of
invaders from the North, sweeping with irresistible force over regions
that the weakness or cowardice of the wearers of the purple left
defenceless before them.Before the northern tribes had settled in their
possessions, and had full time to assimilate the faith and the
institutions which they had found there, the growing organisation was
menaced by a more deadly peril in the incessant and steady advance of
the bloody and fanatical tribes from the East.And in this way De
Maistre's mind continued the picture down to the latest days of all,
when there had arisen men who, denying God and mocking at Christ, were
bent on the destruction of the very foundations of society, and had
nothing better to offer the human race than a miserable return to a
state of nature.As he thus reproduced this long drama, one benign and central figure was
ever present, changeless in the midst of ceaseless change; laboriously
building up with preterhuman patience and preterhuman sagacity, when
other powers, one after another in evil succession, were madly raging to
destroy and to pull down; thinking only of the great interests of order
and civilisation, of which it had been constituted the eternal
protector, and showing its divine origin and inspiration alike by its
unfailing wisdom and its unfailing benevolence.It is the Sovereign
Pontiff who thus stands forth throughout the history of Europe, as the
great Demiurgus of universal civilisation.If the Pope had filled only
such a position as the Patriarch held at Constantinople, or if there had
been no Pope, and Christianity had depended exclusively on the East for
its propagation, with no great spiritual organ in the West, what would
have become of Western development?It was the energy and resolution of
the Pontiffs which resisted the heresies of the East, and preserved to
the Christian religion that plainness and intelligibility, without which
it would never have made a way to the rude understanding and simple
hearts of the barbarians from the North.It was their wise patriotism
which protected Italy against Greek oppression, and by acting the part
of mayors of the palace to the decrepit Eastern emperors, it was they
who contrived to preserve the independence and maintain the fabric of
society until the appearance of the Carlovingians, in whom, with the
rapid instinct of true statesmen, they at once recognised the founders
of a new empire of the West.If the Popes, again, had possessed over the
Eastern empire the same authority that they had over the Western, they
would have repulsed not only the Saracens, but the Turks too, and none
of the evils which these nations have inflicted on us would ever have
taken place.[10] Even as it was, when the Saracens threatened the West,
the Popes were the chief agents in organising resistance, and giving
spirit and animation to the defenders of Europe.Their alert vision saw
that to crush for ever that formidable enemy, it was not enough to
defend ourselves against his assaults; we must attack him at home.The
Crusades, vulgarly treated as the wars of a blind and superstitious
piety, were in truth wars of high policy.From the Council of Clermont
down to the famous day of Lepanto, the hand and spirit of the Pontiff
were to be traced in every part of that tremendous struggle which
prevented Europe from being handed over to the tyranny, ignorance, and
barbarism that have always been the inevitable fruits of Mahometan
conquest, and had already stamped out civilisation in Asia Minor and
Palestine and Greece, once the very garden of the universe.This admirable and politic heroism of the Popes in the face of foes
pressing from without, De Maistre found more than equalled by their
wisdom, courage, and activity in organising and developing the elements
of a civilised system within.The maxim of old societies had been that
which Lucan puts into the mouth of Caesar--_humanum paucis vivit genus_.A vast population of slaves had been one of the inevitable social
conditions of the period: the Popes never rested from their endeavours
to banish servitude from among Christian nations.Women in old
societies had filled a mean and degraded place: it was reserved for the
new spiritual power to rescue the race from that vicious circle in which
men had debased the nature of women, and women had given back all the
weakness and perversity they had received from men, and to perceive that
'the most effectual way of perfecting the man is to ennoble and exalt
the woman.'The organisation of the priesthood, again, was a masterpiece
of practical wisdom.Such an order, removed from the fierce or selfish
interests of ordinary life by the holy regulation of celibacy, and by
the austere discipline of the Church, was indispensable in the midst of
such a society as that which it was the function of the Church to guide.Who but the members of an order thus set apart, acting in strict
subordination to the central power, and so presenting a front of
unbroken spiritual unity, could have held their way among tumultuous
tribes, half-barbarous nobles, and proud and unruly kings, protesting
against wrong, passionately inculcating new and higher ideas of right,
denouncing the darkness of the false gods, calling on all men to worship
the cross and adore the mysteries of the true God?Compare now the
impotency of the Protestant missionary, squatting in gross comfort with
wife and babes among the savages he has come to convert, preaching a
disputatious doctrine, wrangling openly with the rival sent by some
other sect--compare this impotency with the success that follows the
devoted sons of the Church, impressing their proselytes with the
mysterious virtue of their continence, the self-denial of their lives,
the unity of their dogma and their rites; and then recognise the wisdom
of these great churchmen who created a priesthood after this manner in
the days when every priest was as the missionary is now.Finally, it was
the occupants of the holy chair who prepared, softened, one might almost
say sweetened, the occupants of thrones; it was to them that Providence
had confided the education of the sovereigns of Europe.The Popes
brought up the youth of the European monarchy; they made it precisely in
the same way in which Fenelon made the Duke of Burgundy.In each case
the task consisted in eradicating from a fine character an element of
ferocity that would have ruined all.'Everything that constrains a man
strengthens him.He cannot obey without perfecting himself; and by the
mere fact of overcoming himself he is better.Any man will vanquish the
most violent passion at thirty, because at five or six you have taught
him of his own will to give up a plaything or a sweetmeat.That came to
pass to the monarchy, which happens to an individual who has been well
brought up.The continued efforts of the Church, directed by the
Sovereign Pontiff, did what had never been seen before, and what will
never be seen again where that authority is not recognised.Insensibly,
without threats or laws or battles, without violence and without
resistance, the great European charter was proclaimed, not on paper nor
by the voice of public criers; but in all European hearts, then all
Catholic Kings surrender the power of judging by themselves, and nations
in return declare kings infallible and inviolable.Such is the
fundamental law of the European monarchy, and it is the work of the
Popes.'[11]

All this, however, is only the external development of De Maistre's
central idea, the historical corroboration of a truth to which he
conducts us in the first instance by general considerations.Assuming,
what it is less and less characteristic of the present century at any
rate to deny, that Christianity was the only actual force by which the
regeneration of Europe could be effected after the decline of the Roman
civilisation, he insists that, as he again and again expresses it,
'without the Pope there is no veritable Christianity.'What he meant by
this condensed form needs a little explanation, as is always the case
with such simple statements of the products of long and complex
reasoning.In saying that without the Pope there is no true
Christianity, what he considered himself as having established was, that
unless there be some supreme and independent possessor of authority to
settle doctrine, to regulate discipline, to give authentic counsel, to
apply accepted principles to disputed cases, then there can be no such
thing as a religious system which shall have power to bind the members
of a vast and not homogeneous body in the salutary bonds of a common
civilisation, nor to guide and inform an universal conscience.In each
individual state everybody admits the absolute necessity of having some
sovereign power which shall make, declare, and administer the laws, and
from whose action in any one of these aspects there shall be no appeal;
a power that shall be strong enough to protect the rights and enforce
the duties which it has authoritatively proclaimed and enjoined.In free
England, as in despotic Turkey, the privileges and obligations which the
law tolerates or imposes, and all the benefits which their existence
confers on the community, are the creatures and conditions of a supreme
authority from which there is no appeal, whether the instrument by which
this authority makes its will known be an act of parliament or a ukase.This conception of temporal sovereignty, especially familiarised to our
generation by the teaching of Austin, was carried by De Maistre into
discussions upon the limits of the Papal power with great ingenuity and
force, and, if we accept the premisses, with great success.It should be said here, that throughout his book on the Pope, De Maistre
talks of Christianity exclusively as a statesman or a publicist would
talk about it; not theologically nor spiritually, but politically and
socially.The question with which he concerns himself is the utilisation
of Christianity as a force to shape and organise a system of civilised
societies; a study of the conditions under which this utilisation had
taken place in the earlier centuries of the era; and a deduction from
them of the conditions under which we might ensure a repetition of the
process in changed modern circumstance.In the eighteenth century men
were accustomed to ask of Christianity, as Protestants always ask of so
much of Catholicism as they have dropped, whether or no it is true.But
after the Revolution the question changed, and became an inquiry whether
and how Christianity could contribute to the reconstruction of society.People asked less how true it was, than how strong it was; less how many
unquestioned dogmas, than how much social weight it had or could
develop; less as to the precise amount and form of belief that would
save a soul, than as to the way in which it might be expected to assist
the European community.It was the strength of this temper in him which led to his extraordinary
detestation and contempt for the Greeks.Their turn for pure speculation
excited all his anger.In a curious chapter, he exhausts invective in
denouncing them.[12] The sarcasm of Sallust delights him, that the
actions of Greece were very fine, _verum aliquanto minores quam fama
feruntur_.Their military glory was only a flash of about a hundred and
fourteen years from Marathon; compare this with the prolonged splendour
of Rome, France, and England.In philosophy they displayed decent
talent, but even here their true merit is to have brought the wisdom of
Asia into Europe, for they invented nothing.Greece was the home of
syllogism and of unreason.'Read Plato: at every page you will draw a
striking distinction.As often as he is Greek, he wearies you.He is
only great, sublime, penetrating, when he is a theologian; in other
words, when he is announcing positive and everlasting dogmas, free from
all quibble, and which are so clearly marked with the eastern cast, that
not to perceive it one must never have had a glimpse of Asia.... There
was in him a sophist and a theologian, or, if you choose, a Greek and a
Chaldean.'The Athenians could never pardon one of their great leaders,
all of whom fell victims in one shape or another to a temper frivolous
as that of a child, ferocious as that of men,--'_espece de moutons
enrages, toujours menes par la nature, et toujours par nature devorant
leurs bergers_.'As for their oratory, 'the tribune of Athens would have
been the disgrace of mankind if Phocion and men like him, by
occasionally ascending it before drinking the hemlock or setting out for
their place of exile, had not in some sort balanced such a mass of
loquacity, extravagance, and cruelty.'[13]

It is very important to remember this constant solicitude for ideas that
should work well, in connection with that book of De Maistre's which
has had most influence in Europe, by supplying a base for the theories
of ultramontanism.Unless we perceive very clearly that throughout his
ardent speculations on the Papal power his mind was bent upon enforcing
the practical solution of a pressing social problem, we easily
misunderstand him and underrate what he had to say.A charge has been
forcibly urged against him by an eminent English critic, for example,
that he has confounded supremacy with infallibility, than which, as the
writer truly says, no two ideas can be more perfectly distinct, one
being superiority of force, and the other incapacity of error.[14] De
Maistre made logical blunders in abundance quite as bad as this, but he
was too acute, I think, deliberately to erect so elaborate a structure
upon a confusion so very obvious, and that must have stared him in the
face from the first page of his work to the last.If we look upon his
book as a mere general defence of the Papacy, designed to investigate
and fortify all its pretensions one by one, we should have great right
to complain against having two claims so essentially divergent, treated
as though they were the same thing, or could be held in their places by
the same supports.But let us regard the treatise on the Pope not as
meant to convince free-thinkers or Protestants that divine grace
inspires every decree of the Holy Father, though that would have been
the right view of it if it had been written fifty years earlier.It was
composed within the first twenty years of the present century, when the
universe, to men of De Maistre's stamp, seemed once more without form
and void.His object, as he tells us more than once, was to find a way
of restoring a religion and a morality in Europe; of giving to truth the
forces demanded for the conquests that she was meditating; of
strengthening the thrones of sovereigns, and of gently calming that
general fermentation of spirit which threatened mightier evils than any
that had yet overwhelmed society.From this point of view we shall see
that the distinction between supremacy and infallibility was not worth
recognising.Practically, he says, 'infallibility is only a consequence of supremacy,
or rather it is absolutely the same thing under two different names....
In effect it is the same thing, _in practice_, not to be subject to
error, and not to be liable to be accused of it.Thus, even if we should
agree that no divine promise was made to the Pope, he would not be less
infallible or deemed so, as the final tribunal; for every judgment from
which you cannot appeal is and must be (_est et doit etre_) held for
just in every human association, under any imaginable form of
government; and every true statesman will understand me perfectly, when
I say that the point is to ascertain not only if the Sovereign Pontiff
is, but if he must be, infallible.'[15] In another place he says
distinctly enough that the infallibility of the Church has two aspects;
in one of them it is the object of divine promise, in the other it is a
human implication, and that in the latter aspect infallibility is
supposed in the Church, just 'as we are absolutely bound to suppose it,
even in temporal sovereignties (where it does not really exist), under
pain of seeing society dissolved.'The Church only demands what other
sovereignties demand, though she has the immense superiority over them
of having her claim backed by direct promise from heaven.[16] Take away
the dogma, if you will, he says, and only consider the thing
politically, which is exactly what he really does all through the book.The pope, from this point of view, asks for no other infallibility than
that which is attributed to all sovereigns.[17] Without either
vindicating or surrendering the supernatural side of the Papal claims,
he only insists upon the political, social, or human side of it, as an
inseparable quality of an admitted supremacy.[18] In short, from
beginning to end of this speculation, from which the best kind of
ultramontanism has drawn its defence, he evinces a deprecatory
anxiety--a very rare temper with De Maistre--not to fight on the issue
of the dogma of infallibility over which Protestants and unbelievers
have won an infinite number of cheap victories; that he leaves as a
theme more fitted for the disputations of theologians.My position, he
seems to keep saying, is that if the Pope is spiritually supreme, then
he is virtually and practically _as if he were_ infallible, just in the
same sense in which the English Parliament and monarch, and the Russian
Czar, are as if they were infallible.But let us not argue so much about
this, which is only secondary.The main question is whether without the
Pope there can be a true Christianity, 'that is to say, a Christianity,
active, powerful, converting, regenerating, conquering, perfecting.'De Maistre was probably conducted to his theory by an analogy, which he
tacitly leaned upon more strongly than it could well bear, between
temporal organisation and spiritual organisation.In inchoate
communities, the momentary self-interest and the promptly stirred
passions of men would rend the growing society in pieces, unless they
were restrained by the strong hand of law in some shape or other,
written or unwritten, and administered by an authority, either
physically too strong to be resisted, or else set up by the common
consent seeking to further the general convenience.To divide this
authority, so that none should know where to look for a sovereign
decree, nor be able to ascertain the commands of sovereign law; to
embody it in the persons of many discordant expounders, each assuming
oracular weight and equal sanction; to leave individuals to administer
and interpret it for themselves, and to decide among themselves its
application to their own cases; what would this be but a deliberate
preparation for anarchy and dissolution?For it is one of the clear
conditions of the efficacy of the social union, that every member of it
should be able to know for certain the terms on which he belongs to it,
the compliances which it will insist upon in him, and the compliances
which it will in turn permit him to insist upon in others, and therefore
it is indispensable that there should be some definite and admitted
centre where this very essential knowledge should be accessible.Some such reflections as these must have been at the bottom of De
Maistre's great apology for the Papal supremacy, or at any rate they may
serve to bring before our minds with greater clearness the kind of
foundations on which his scheme rested.For law substitute Christianity,
for social union spiritual union, for legal obligations the obligations
of the faith.Instead of individuals bound together by allegiance to
common political institutions, conceive communities united in the bonds
of religious brotherhood into a sort of universal republic, under the
moderate supremacy of a supreme spiritual power.As a matter of fact, it
was the intervention of this spiritual power which restrained the
anarchy, internal and external, of the ferocious and imperfectly
organised sovereignties that figure in the early history of modern
Europe.And as a matter of theory, what could be more rational and
defensible than such an intervention made systematic, with its
rightfulness and disinterestedness universally recognised?Grant
Christianity as the spiritual basis of the life and action of modern
communities; supporting both the organised structure of each of them,
and the interdependent system composed of them all; accepted by the
individual members of each, and by the integral bodies forming the
whole.But who shall declare what the Christian doctrine is, and how its
maxims bear upon special cases, and what oracles they announce in
particular sets of circumstances?Amid the turbulence of popular
passion, in face of the crushing despotism of an insensate tyrant,
between the furious hatred of jealous nations or the violent ambition of
rival sovereigns, what likelihood would there be of either party to the
contention yielding tranquilly and promptly to any presentation of
Christian teaching made by the other, or by some suspected neutral as a
decisive authority between them?Obviously there must be some supreme
and indisputable interpreter, before whose final decree the tyrant
should quail, the flood of popular lawlessness flow back within its
accustomed banks, and contending sovereigns or jealous nations
fraternally embrace.Again, in those questions of faith and discipline,
which the ill-exercised ingenuity of men is for ever raising and
pressing upon the attention of Christendom, it is just as obvious that
there must be some tribunal to pronounce an authoritative judgment.Otherwise, each nation is torn into sects; and amid the throng of sects
where is unity?'To maintain that a crowd of independent churches form a
church, one and universal, is to maintain in other terms that all the
political governments of Europe only form a single government, one and
universal.'There could no more be a kingdom of France without a king,
nor an empire of Russia without an emperor, than there could be one
universal church without an acknowledged head.That this head must be
the successor of St.Peter, is declared alike by the voice of tradition,
the explicit testimony of the early writers, the repeated utterances of
later theologians of all schools, and that general sentiment which
presses itself upon every conscientious reader of religious history.The argument that the voice of the Church is to be sought in general
councils is absurd.To maintain that a council has any other function
than to assure and certify the Pope, when he chooses to strengthen his
judgment or to satisfy his doubts, is to destroy visible unity.Suppose
there to be an equal division of votes, as happened in the famous case
of Fenelon, and might as well happen in a general council, the doubt
would after all be solved by the final vote of the Pope.And 'what is
doubtful for twenty selected men is doubtful for the whole human race.Those who suppose that by multiplying the deliberating voices doubt is
lessened, must have very little knowledge of men, and can never have sat
in a deliberative body.'Again, supposing there to present itself one of
those questions of divine metaphysics that it is absolutely necessary to
refer to the decision of the supreme tribunal.Then our interest is not
that it should be decided in such or such a manner, but that it should
be decided without delay and without appeal.Besides, the world is now
grown too vast for general councils, which seem to be made only for the
youth of Christianity.In fine, why pursue futile or mischievous
discussions as to whether the Pope is above the Council or the Council
above the Pope?In ordinary questions in which a king is conscious of
sufficient light, he decides them himself, while the others in which he
is not conscious of this light, he transfers to the States-General
presided over by himself, but he is equally sovereign in either case.Let us be content to know, in the words
of Thomassin,[19] that 'the Pope in the midst of his Council is above
himself, and that the Council decapitated of its chief is below him.'The point so constantly dwelt upon by Bossuet, the obligation of the
canons upon the Pope, was of very little worth in De Maistre's judgment,
and he almost speaks with disrespect of the great Catholic defender for
being so prolix and pertinacious in elaborating it.Here again he finds
in Thomassin the most concise statement of what he held to be the true
view, just as he does in the controversy as to the relative superiority
of the Pope or the Council.'There is only an apparent contradiction,'
says Thomassin, 'between saying that the Pope is above the canons, and
that he is bound by them; that he is master of the canons, or that he is
not.Those who place him above the canons or make him their master, only
pretend that he _has a dispensing power over them_; while those who deny
that he is above the canons or is their master, mean no more than that
_he can only exercise a dispensing power for the convenience and in the
necessities of the Church_.'This is an excellent illustration of the
thoroughly political temper in which De Maistre treats the whole
subject.He looks at the power of the Pope over the canons much as a
modern English statesman looks at the question of the coronation oath,
and the extent to which it binds the monarch to the maintenance of the
laws existing at the time of its imposition.In the same spirit he
banishes from all account the crowd of nonsensical objections to Papal
supremacy, drawn from imaginary possibilities.Suppose a Pope, for
example, were to abolish all the canons at a single stroke; suppose him
to become an unbeliever; suppose him to go mad; and so forth.'Why,' De
Maistre says, 'there is not in the whole world a single power in a
condition to bear all possible and arbitrary hypotheses of this sort;
and if you judge them by what they can do, without speaking of what they
have done, they will have to be abolished every one.'[20] This, it may
be worth noticing, is one of the many passages in De Maistre's writings
which, both in the solidity of their argument and the direct force of
their expression, recall his great predecessor in the anti-revolutionary
cause, the ever-illustrious Burke.The vigour with which De Maistre sums up all these pleas for supremacy
is very remarkable; and to the crowd of enemies and indifferents, and
especially to the statesmen who are among them, he appeals with
admirable energy.Do you mean that the nations
should live without any religion, and do you not begin to perceive that
a religion there must be?And does not Christianity, not only by its
intrinsic worth but because it is in possession, strike you as
preferable to every other?Have you been better contented with other
attempts in this way?Peradventure the twelve apostles might please you
better than the Theophilanthropists and Martinists?Does the Sermon on
the Mount seem to you a passable code of morals?And if the entire
people were to regulate their conduct on this model, should you be
content?I fancy that I hear you reply affirmatively.Well, since the
only object now is to maintain this religion for which you thus declare
your preference, how could you have, I do not say the stupidity, but the
cruelty, to turn it into a democracy, and to place this precious deposit
in the hands of the rabble?'You attach too much importance to the dogmatic part of this religion.By what strange contradiction would you desire to agitate the universe
for some academic quibble, for miserable wranglings about mere words
(these are your own terms)?Will you
call the Bishop of Quebec and the Bishop of Lucon to interpret a line of
the Catechism?That believers should quarrel about infallibility is what
I know, for I see it; but that statesmen should quarrel in the same way
about this great privilege, is what I shall never be able to
conceive.... That all the bishops in the world should be convoked to
determine a divine truth necessary to salvation--nothing more natural,
if such a method is indispensable; for no effort, no trouble, ought to
be spared for so exalted an aim.But if the only point is the
establishment of one opinion in the place of another, then the
travelling expenses of even one single Infallible are sheer waste.If
you want to spare the two most valuable things on earth, time and money,
make all haste to write to Rome, in order to procure thence a lawful
decision which shall declare the unlawful doubt.Nothing more is needed;
policy asks no more.'[21]

Definitely, then, the influence of the Popes restored to their ancient
supremacy would be exercised in the renewal and consolidation of social
order resting on the Christian faith, somewhat after this manner.The
anarchic dogma of the sovereignty of peoples, having failed to do
anything beyond showing that the greatest evils resulting from obedience
do not equal the thousandth part of those which result from rebellion,
would be superseded by the practice of appeals to the authority of the
Holy See.Do not suppose that the Revolution is at an end, or that the
column is replaced because it is raised up from the ground.A man must
be blind not to see that all the sovereignties in Europe are growing
weak; on all sides confidence and affection are deserting them; sects
and the spirit of individualism are multiplying themselves in an
appalling manner.There are only two alternatives: you must either
purify the will of men, or else you must enchain it; the monarch who
will not do the first, must enslave his subjects or perish; servitude or
spiritual unity is the only choice open to nations.On the one hand is
the gross and unrestrained tyranny of what in modern phrase is styled
Imperialism, and on the other a wise and benevolent modification of
temporal sovereignty in the interests of all by an established and
accepted spiritual power.No middle path lies before the people of
Europe.Temporal absolutism we must have.The only question is whether
or no it shall be modified by the wise, disinterested, and moderating
counsels of the Church, as given by her consecrated chief.*       *       *       *       *

There can be very little doubt that the effective way in which De
Maistre propounded and vindicated this theory made a deep impression on
the mind of Comte.Very early in his career this eminent man had
declared: 'De Maistre has for me the peculiar property of helping me to
estimate the philosophic capacity of people, by the repute in which they
hold him.'Among his other reasons at that time for thinking well of M.
Guizot was that, notwithstanding his transcendent Protestantism, he
complied with the test of appreciating De Maistre.[22] Comte's rapidly
assimilative intelligence perceived that here at last there was a
definite, consistent, and intelligible scheme for the reorganisation of
European society, with him the great end of philosophic endeavour.Its
principle of the division of the spiritual and temporal powers, and of
the relation that ought to subsist between the two, was the base of
Comte's own scheme.In general form the plans of social reconstruction are identical; in
substance, it need scarcely be said, the differences are fundamental.The temporal power, according to Comte's design, is to reside with
industrial chiefs, and the spiritual power to rest upon a doctrine
scientifically established.De Maistre, on the other hand, believed that
the old authority of kings and Christian pontiffs was divine, and any
attempt to supersede it in either case would have seemed to him as
desperate as it seemed impious.In his strange speculation on _Le
Principe Generateur des Constitutions Politiques_, he contends that all
laws in the true sense of the word (which by the way happens to be
decidedly an arbitrary and exclusive sense) are of supernatural origin,
and that the only persons whom we have any right to call legislators,
are those half-divine men who appear mysteriously in the early history
of nations, and counterparts to whom we never meet in later days.Elsewhere he maintains to the same effect, that royal families in the
true sense of the word 'are growths of nature, and differ from others,
as a tree differs from a shrub.'People suppose a family to be royal because it reigns; on the contrary,
it reigns because it is royal, because it has more life, _plus d'esprit
royal_--surely as mysterious and occult a force as the _virtus
dormitiva_ of opium.The common life of man is about thirty years; the
average duration of the reigns of European sovereigns, being Christian,
is at the very lowest calculation twenty.How is it possible that 'lives
should be only thirty years, and reigns from twenty-two to twenty-five,
if princes had not more common life than other men?'Mark again, the
influence of religion in the duration of sovereignties.All the
Christian reigns are longer than all the non-Christian reigns, ancient
and modern, and Catholic reigns have been longer than Protestant reigns.The reigns in England, which averaged more than twenty-three years
before the Reformation, have only been seventeen years since that, and
those of Sweden, which were twenty-two, have fallen to the same figure
of seventeen.Denmark, however, for some unknown cause does not appear
to have undergone this law of abbreviation; so, says De Maistre with
rather unwonted restraint, let us abstain from generalising.As a matter
of fact, however, the generalisation was complete in his own mind, and
there was nothing inconsistent with his view of the government of the
universe in the fact that a Catholic prince should live longer than a
Protestant; indeed such a fact was the natural condition of his view
being true.Many differences among the people who hold to the
theological interpretation of the circumstances of life arise from the
different degrees of activity which they variously attribute to the
intervention of God, from those who explain the fall of a sparrow to the
ground by a special and direct energy of the divine will, up to those
at the opposite end of the scale, who think that direct participation
ended when the universe was once fairly launched.De Maistre was of
those who see the divine hand on every side and at all times.If, then,
Protestantism was a pernicious rebellion against the faith which God had
provided for the comfort and salvation of men, why should not God be
likely to visit princes, as offenders with the least excuse for their
backslidings, with the curse of shortness of days?In a trenchant passage De Maistre has expounded the Protestant
confession of faith, and shown what astounding gaps it leaves as an
interpretation of the dealings of God with man.'By virtue of a terrible
anathema,' he supposes the Protestant to say, 'inexplicable no doubt,
but much less inexplicable than incontestable, the human race lost all
its rights.Plunged in mortal darkness, it was ignorant of all, since it
was ignorant of God; and, being ignorant of him, it could not pray to
him, so that it was spiritually dead without being able to ask for life.Arrived by rapid degradation at the last stage of debasement, it
outraged nature by its manners, its laws, even by its religions.It
consecrated all vices, it wallowed in filth, and its depravation was
such that the history of those times forms a dangerous picture, which it
is not good for all men so much as to look upon.God, however, _having
dissembled for forty centuries_, bethought him of his creation.At the
appointed moment announced from all time, he did not despise a virgin's
womb; he clothed himself in our unhappy nature, and appeared on the
earth; we saw him, we touched him, he spoke to us; he lived, he taught,
he suffered, he died for us.He arose from his tomb according to his
promise; he appeared again among us, solemnly to assure to his Church a
succour that would last as long as the world.'But, alas, this effort of almighty benevolence was a long way from
securing all the success that had been foretold.For lack of knowledge,
or of strength, or by distraction maybe, God missed his aim, and could
not keep his word.Less sage than a chemist who should undertake to shut
up ether in canvas or paper, he only confided to men the truth that he
had brought upon the earth; it escaped, then, as one might have
foreseen, by all human pores; soon, this holy religion revealed to man
by the Man-God, became no more than an infamous idolatry, which would
remain to this very moment if Christianity after sixteen centuries had
not been suddenly brought back to its original purity by a couple of
sorry creatures.'[23]

Perhaps it would be easier than he supposed to present his own system in
an equally irrational aspect.If you measure the proceedings of
omnipotence by the uses to which a wise and benevolent man would put
such superhuman power, if we can imagine a man of this kind endowed with
it, De Maistre's theory of the extent to which a supreme being
interferes in human things, is after all only a degree less ridiculous
and illogical, less inadequate and abundantly assailable, than that
Protestantism which he so heartily despised.Would it be difficult,
after borrowing the account, which we have just read, of the tremendous
efforts made by a benign creator to shed moral and spiritual light upon
the world, to perplex the Catholic as bitterly as the Protestant, by
confronting him both with the comparatively scanty results of those
efforts, and with the too visible tendencies of all the foremost
agencies in modern civilisation to leave them out of account as forces
practically spent?*       *       *       *       *

De Maistre has been surpassed by no thinker that we know of as a
defender of the old order.If anybody could rationalise the idea of
supernatural intervention in human affairs, the idea of a Papal
supremacy, the idea of a spiritual unity, De Maistre's acuteness and
intellectual vigour, and, above all, his keen sense of the urgent social
need of such a thing being done, would assuredly have enabled him to do
it.In 1817, when he wrote the work in which this task is attempted, the
hopelessness of such an achievement was less obvious than it is now.The Revolution lay in a deep slumber that
many persons excusably took for the quiescence of extinction.Legitimacy
and the spiritual system that was its ally in the face of the
Revolution, though mostly its rival or foe when they were left alone
together, seemed to be restored to the fulness of their power.Fifty
years have elapsed since then, and each year has seen a progressive
decay in the principles which then were triumphant.It was not,
therefore, without reason that De Maistre warned people against
believing '_que la colonne est replacee, parcequ'elle est relevee_.'The
solution which he so elaborately recommended to Europe has shown itself
desperate and impossible.Catholicism may long remain a vital creed to
millions of men, a deep source of spiritual consolation and refreshment,
and a bright lamp in perplexities of conduct and morals; but resting on
dogmas which cannot by any amount of compromise be incorporated with the
daily increasing mass of knowledge, assuming as the condition of its
existence forms of the theological hypothesis which all the
preponderating influences of contemporary thought concur directly or
indirectly in discrediting, upheld by an organisation which its history
for the last five centuries has exposed to the distrust and hatred of
men as the sworn enemy of mental freedom and growth, the pretensions of
Catholicism to renovate society are among the most pitiable and impotent
that ever devout, high-minded, and benevolent persons deluded themselves
into maintaining or accepting.Over the modern invader it is as
powerless as paganism was over the invaders of old.The barbarians of
industrialism, grasping chiefs and mutinous men, give no ear to priest
or pontiff, who speak only dead words, who confront modern issues with
blind eyes, and who stretch out a palsied hand to help.Christianity,
according to a well-known saying, has been tried and failed; the
religion of Christ remains to be tried.One would prefer to qualify the
first clause, by admitting how much Christianity has done for Europe
even with its old organisation, and to restrict the charge of failure
within the limits of the modern time.Whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its
founder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human
sentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting
men together again in a common and effective faith, is a question which
it is unnecessary to discuss here.'_They talk about the first centuries
of Christianity_,' said De Maistre, '_I would not be sure that they are
over yet_.'Perhaps not; only if the first centuries are not yet over,
it is certain that the Christianity of the future will have to be so
different from the Christianity of the past, as to demand or deserve
another name.Even if Christianity, itself renewed, could successfully encounter the
achievement of renewing society, De Maistre's ideal of a spiritual power
controlling the temporal power, and conciliating peoples with their
rulers by persuasion and a coercion only moral, appears to have little
chance of being realised.The separation of the two powers is sealed,
with a completeness that is increasingly visible.The principles on
which the process of the emancipation of politics is being so rapidly
carried on, demonstrate that the most marked tendencies of modern
civilisation are strongly hostile to a renewal in any imaginable shape,
or at any future time, of a connection whether of virtual subordination
or nominal equality, which has laid such enormous burdens on the
consciences and understandings of men.If the Church has the uppermost
hand, except in primitive times, it destroys freedom; if the State is
supreme, it destroys spirituality.The free Church in the free State is
an idea that every day more fully recommends itself to the public
opinion of Europe, and the sovereignty of the Pope, like that of all
other spiritual potentates, can only be exercised over those who choose
of their own accord to submit to it; a sovereignty of a kind which De
Maistre thought not much above anarchy.To conclude, De Maistre's mind was of the highest type of those who fill
the air with the arbitrary assumptions of theology, and the abstractions
of the metaphysical stage of thought.At every point you meet the
peremptorily declared volition of a divine being, or the ontological
property of a natural object.The French Revolution is explained by the
will of God; and the kings reign because they have the _esprit royal_.Every truth is absolute, not relative; every explanation is universal,
not historic.These differences in method and point of view amply
explain his arrival at conclusions that seem so monstrous to men who
look upon all knowledge as relative, and insist that the only possible
road to true opinion lies away from volitions and abstractions in the
positive generalisations of experience.There can be no more
satisfactory proof of the rapidity with which we are leaving these
ancient methods, and the social results which they produced, than the
willingness with which every rightly instructed mind now admits how
indispensable were the first, and how beneficial the second.Those can
best appreciate De Maistre and his school, what excellence lay in their
aspirations, what wisdom in their system, who know most clearly why
their aspirations were hopeless, and what makes their system an
anachronism.FOOTNOTES:

[10] De Maistre forgot or underestimated the services of Leo the
Isaurian whose repulse of the Caliph's forces at Constantinople (A.D.717) was perhaps as important for Europe as the more renowned victory of
Charles Martel.But then Leo was an Iconoclast and heretic.Finlay's
_Byzantine Empire_, pp.[11] _Du Pape_, bk.[12] _Du Pape_, bk.'The Greeks,' he
says, 'had at times only a secondary share in the ecclesiastical
controversies in the Eastern Church, though the circumstance of these
controversies having been carried on in the Greek language has made the
natives of Western Europe attribute them to a philosophic, speculative,
and polemic spirit, inherent in the Hellenic mind.A very slight
examination of history is sufficient to prove that several of the
heresies which disturbed the Eastern Church had their origin in the more
profound religious ideas of the oriental nations, and that many of the
opinions called heretical were in a great measure expressions of the
mental nationality of the Syrians, Armenians, Egyptians, and Persians,
and had no conception whatever with the Greek mind.'--_Byzantine Empire,
from 716 to 1057_, p.263) remarks very truly, that 'the religious or
theological portion of Popery, as a section of the Christian Church, is
really Greek; and it is only the ecclesiastical, political, and
theoretic peculiarities of the fabric which can be considered as the
work of the Latin Church.'[14] Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen in the _Saturday Review_, Sept.[15] _Du Pape_, bk.[16] _Ib._ bk.[17] _Ib._ bk.[18] '_Il n'y a point de souverainete qui pour le bonheur des hommes, et
pour le sien surtout, ne soit bornee de quelque maniere, mais dans
l'interieur de ces bornes, placees comme il plait a Dieu, elle est
toujours et partout absolue et tenue pour infaillible.Et quand je parle
de l'exercice legitime de la souverainete, je n'entends point ou je ne
dis point l'exercice_ juste, _ce qui produirait une amphibologie
dangereuse, a moins que par ce dernier mot on ne veuille dire que tout
ce qu'elle opine dans son cercle est_ juste ou tenu pour tel, _ce qui
est la verite.C'est ainsi qu'un tribunal supreme, tant qu'il ne sort
pas de ses attributions, est toujours juste_; car c'est la meme chose
DANS LA PRATIQUE, d'etre infaillible, ou de se tromper sans appel.'--Bk.[19] Thomassin, the eminent French theologian, flourished from the
middle to the end of the seventeenth century.The aim of his writings
generally was to reconcile conflicting opinions on discipline or
doctrine by exhibiting a true sense in all.In this spirit he wrote on
the Pope and the Councils, and on the never-ending question of Grace.Among other things, he insisted that all languages could be traced to
the Hebrew.He wrote a defence of the edict in which Lewis XIV.revoked
the Edict of Nantes, contending that it was less harsh than some of the
decrees of Theodosius and Justinian, which the holiest fathers of the
Church had not scrupled to approve--an argument which would now be
thought somewhat too dangerous for common use, as cutting both ways.Gibbon made use of his _Discipline de l'Eglise_ in the twentieth
chapter, and elsewhere.[20] _Du Pape_, bk.[22] Littre, _Auguste Comte et la Phil.[23] _Du Pape_, Conclusion, p.*       *       *       *       *

commander-in-chief why don't you grant yourself a ten years' vacation on
full pay, and at the end of that time return to the laborious work you
have undertaken, refreshed?""If I go off, there
won't be any war.""That'll spite the enemy just
as much as it will our side; and maybe he'll get so tired waiting for
us to begin that he'll lie down and die or else give himself up.""Well, I don't know what to do," said Jimmieboy, very much perplexed."I'd hire some one else to take my place if I were you, and let him do
the fighting and provisioning until you are all ready," said the sprite."The Giant Fortyforefoot," returned the sprite.He's a great warrior in the first place and a great magician in the
second.He can do the most wonderful tricks you ever saw in all your
life.For instance,

    "He'll take two ordinary balls,
       He'll toss 'em to the sky,
     And each when to the earth it falls
       Will be a satin tie.He'll take a tricycle in hand,
       He'll give the thing a heave,
     He'll mutter some queer sentence, and
       'Twill go right up his sleeve.He'll ask you what your name may be,
       And if you answer 'Jim!'He'll turn a handspring--one, two, three!He'll take a fifty-dollar bill,
       He'll tie it to a chain,
     He'll cry out 'Presto!'and you will
       Not see your bill again.""I'd like to see him," said Jimmieboy."But I can't say I want to be
eaten up, you know, and I'd like to have you tell me before we go how
you are going to prevent his eating me.""You suffer under the great
disadvantage of being a very toothsome, tender morsel, and in all
probability Fortyforefoot would order you stewed in cream or made over
into a tart.added the major, smacking his lips so suggestively
that Jimmieboy drew away from him, slightly alarmed."Why, it makes my
mouth water to think of a pudding made of you, with a touch of cinnamon
and a dash of maple syrup, and a shake of sawdust and a hard sauce.This last word of the major's was a sort of ecstatic cluck such as boys
often make after having tasted something they are particularly fond of."What's the use of scaring the boy, Blueface?"said the sprite, angrily,
as he noted Jimmieboy's alarm.You can be
as brave and terrible as you please in the presence of your enemies, but
in the presence of my friends you've got to behave yourself."Why, he could rout me
with a frown.His little finger could, unaided, put me to flight if it
felt so disposed.I was complimenting him--not trying to frighten him."When I went into ecstasies
       O'er pudding made of him,
     'Twas just because I wished to please
       The honorable Jim;
     And now, in spite of your rebuff,
       The statement I repeat:
     I think he's really good enough
       For any one to eat.""Well, that's different," said the sprite, accepting the major's
statement."I quite agree with you there; but when you go clucking
around here like a hen who has just tasted the sweetest grain of corn
she ever had, or like a boy after eating a plate of ice-cream, you're
just a bit terrifying--particularly to the appetizing morsel that has
given rise to those clucks.It's enough to make the stoutest heart
quail."retorted the major, with a wink at Jimmieboy."Neither my
manner nor the manner of any other being could make a stout hart quail,
because stout harts are deer and quails are birds!"This more or less feeble joke served to put the three travelers in good
humor again.Jimmieboy smiled over it; the sprite snickered, and the
major threw himself down on the grass in a perfect paroxysm of laughter.When he had finished he got up again and said:

"Well, what are we going to do about it?I propose we attack
Fortyforefoot unawares and tie his hands behind his back."You are a wonderfully wise person," retorted the sprite."How on earth
is Fortyforefoot to show his tricks if we tie his hands?""By means of his tricks," returned the major."If he is any kind of a
magician he'll get his hands free in less than a minute.""I'm not good at
conundrums," said the major."I'm sure I don't know," returned the sprite, impatiently."Then why waste time asking riddles to which you don't know the answer?""You'll have me mad in a minute, and when I'm mad woe
be unto him which I'm angry at.""Don't quarrel," said Jimmieboy, stepping between his two friends, with
whom it seemed to be impossible to keep peace for any length of time."If you quarrel I shall leave you both and go back to my company."But he
mustn't do it again.Now as you have chosen to reject my plan of
attacking Fortyforefoot and tying his hands, suppose you suggest
something better, Mr."I think the safe thing would be for Jimmieboy to wear this invisible
coat of mine when in the giant's presence.If Fortyforefoot can't see
him he is safe," said the sprite."I don't see any invisible coat anywhere," said the major."Nobody can see it, of course," said the sprite, scornfully."Yes, I do," retorted the major."I only pretended I didn't so that I
could make you ask the question, which enables me to say that something
invisible is something you can't see, like your jokes.""I can make a better joke than you can with my hands tied behind my
back," snapped the sprite."I can't make jokes with your hands tied behind your back, but I can
make one with my own hands tied behind my back that Jimmieboy here can
see with his eyes shut," said the major, scornfully."Why--er--let me see; why--er--when is a sunbeam sharp?"asked the
major, who did not expect to be taken up so quickly."Bad as can be," said the sprite, his nose turned up until it interfered
with his eyesight.When is a joke not a
joke?""Haven't the slightest idea," observed Jimmieboy, after scratching his
head and trying to think for a minute or two."When it's one of the major's," roared the sprite, whereat the woods
rang with his laughter.The major first turned pale and then grew red in the face."That settles it," he said, throwing off his coat."That is a deadly
insult, and there is now no possible way to avoid a duel.""I am ready for you at any time," said the sprite, calmly."Only as the
challenged party I have the choice of weapons, and inasmuch as this is a
hot day, I choose the jawbone."said the major, with a gesture of
impatience.We will
withdraw to that moss-covered rock underneath the trees in there, gather
enough huckleberries and birch bark for our luncheon, and catch a mess
of trout from the brook to go with them, and then we can fight our duel
all the rest of the afternoon.""But how's that going to satisfy my wounded honor?""I'll tell one story," said the sprite, "and you'll tell another, and
when we are through, the one that Jimmieboy says has told the best story
will be the victor.That is better than trying to hurt each other, I
think.""I think so too," put in Jimmieboy."Well, it isn't a bad scheme," agreed the major."Particularly the
luncheon part of it; so you may count on me.I've got a story that will
lift your hair right off your head."So Jimmieboy and his two strange friends retired into the wood, gathered
the huckleberries and birch bark, caught, cooked, and ate the trout, and
then sat down together on the moss-covered rock to fight the duel.The
two fighters drew lots to find out which should tell the first story,
and as the sprite was the winner, he began."When I was not more than a thousand years old--" said the sprite."That was nine thousand years
ago--before this world was made.I celebrated my
ten-thousand-and-sixteenth birthday last Friday--but that has nothing to
do with my story.When I was not more than a thousand years of age, my
parents, who occupied a small star about forty million miles from here,
finding that my father could earn a better living if he were located
nearer the moon, moved away from my birthplace and rented a good-sized,
four-pronged star in the suburbs of the great orb of night.In the old
star we were too far away from the markets for my father to sell the
products of his farm for anything like what they cost him; freight
charges were very heavy, and often the stage-coach that ran between
Twinkleville and the moon would not stop at Twinkleville at all, and
then all the stuff that we had raised that week would get stale, lose
its fizz, and have to be thrown away.""Let me beg your pardon again," put in the major."But what did you
raise on your farm?I never heard of farm products having fizz to lose.""We raised soda-water chiefly," returned the sprite, amiably."Soda-water and suspender buttons.The soda-water was cultivated and the
suspender buttons seemed to grow wild.We never knew exactly how; though
from what I have learned since about them, I think I begin to understand
the science of it; and I wish now that I could find a way to return to
Twinkleville, because I am certain it must be a perfect treasure-house
of suspender buttons by this time.Even in my day they used to lie about
by the million--metallic buttons every one of them.They must be worth
to-day at least a dollar a thousand.""What is your idea about the way they happened to come there, based on
what you have learned since?""Well, it is a very simple idea," returned the sprite."You know when a
suspender button comes off it always disappears.Of course it must go
somewhere, but the question is, where?No one has ever yet been known to
recover the suspender button he has once really lost; and my notion of
it is simply that the minute a metal suspender button comes off the
clothes of anybody in all the whole universe, it immediately flies up
through the air and space to Twinkleville, which is nothing more than a
huge magnet, and lies there until somebody picks it up and tries to sell
it.I remember as a boy sweeping our back yard clear of them one
evening, and waking the next morning to find the whole place covered
with them again; but we never could make money on them, because the moon
was our sole market, and only the best people of the moon ever used
suspenders, and as these were unfortunately relatives of ours, we had to
give them all the buttons they wanted for nothing, so that the button
crops became rather an expense to us than otherwise.But with soda-water
it was different.Everybody, it doesn't make any difference where he
lives, likes soda-water, and it was an especially popular thing in the
moon, where the plain water is always so full of fish that nobody can
drink it.But as I said before, often the stage-coach wouldn't or
couldn't stop, and we found ourselves getting poorer every day.Finally
my father made up his mind to lease, and move into this new star, sink a
half-dozen soda-water wells there, and by means of a patent he owned,
which enabled him to give each well a separate and distinct flavor,
drive everybody else out of the business.""You don't happen to remember how that patent your father owned worked,
do you?"asked the major, noticing that Jimmieboy seemed particularly
interested when the sprite mentioned this."If you do, I'd like to buy
the plan of it from you and give it to Jimmieboy for a Christmas
present, so that he can have soda-water wells in his own back yard at
home.""No, I can't remember anything about it," said the sprite."Nine
thousand years is a long time to remember things of that kind, though I
don't think the scheme was a very hard one to work.For vanilla cream,
it only required a well with plain soda-water in it with a quart of
vanilla beans and three pints of cream poured into it four times a week;
same way with other flavors--a quart of strawberries for strawberry,
sarsaparilla for sarsaparilla, and so forth; but the secret was in the
pouring; there was something in the way papa did the pouring; I never
knew just what it was.But if you don't stop asking questions I'll never finish my story.""You shouldn't make it so interesting if you don't want us to have our
curiosity excited by it," said Jimmieboy."I'd have asked those
questions if the major hadn't."Well, we moved, and in a very short time were comfortably settled in
the suburban star I have mentioned," continued the sprite."As we
expected, my father grew very, very rich.He was referred to in the moon
newspapers as 'The Soda-water King,' and once an article about him said
that he owned the finest suspender-button mine in the universe, which
was more or less true, but which, as it turned out, was unfortunate in
its results.Some moon people hearing of his ownership of the
Twinkleville Button Mines came to him and tried to persuade him that
they ought to be worked.Father said he didn't see any use of it,
because the common people didn't wear suspenders, and so didn't need the
buttons."'True,' said they, 'but we can compel them to need them, by making a
law requiring that everybody over sixteen shall wear suspenders.'"'That's a good idea,' said my father, and he tried to have it made a
law that every one should wear suspenders, high or low, and as a result
he got everybody mad at him.The best people were angry, because up to
that time the wearing of suspenders had been regarded as a sign of noble
birth, and if everybody, including the common people, were to have them
they would cease to be so.The common people themselves were angry,
because to have to buy suspenders would simply be an addition to the
cost of living, and they hadn't any money to spare.In consequence we
were cut off by the best people of the moon.Nobody ever came to see us
except the very commonest kind of common people, and they came at night,
and then only to drop pailfuls of cod-liver oil, squills, ipecac, and
other unpopular things into our soda-water wells, so that in a very
short time my poor father's soda-water business was utterly ruined.People don't like to order ten quarts of vanilla cream soda-water for
Sunday dinner, and find it flavored with cod-liver oil, you know.""Yes, I do know," said Jimmieboy, screwing his face up in an endeavor to
give the major and the sprite some idea of how little he liked the taste
of cod-liver oil."I think cod-liver oil is worse than measles or
mumps, because you can't have measles or mumps more than once, and there
isn't any end to the times you can have cod-liver oil.""I'm with you there," said the major, emphasizing his remark by slapping
Jimmieboy on the back."In fact, sir, on page 29 of my book called
'Musings on Medicines' you will find--if it is ever published--these
lines:

          "The oils of cod!They make me feel tremendous odd,
           Nor hesitate
           I here to state
     I wildly hate the oils of cod.""When I start my autograph album I want you
to write those lines on the first page.""Never, I hope," replied the sprite, with a chuckle."And now suppose
you don't interrupt my story again."Clouds began to gather on the major's face again.The sprite's rebuke
had evidently made him very angry."Sir," said he, as soon as his feelings permitted him to speak."If you
make any more such remarks as that, another duel may be necessary after
this one is fought--which I should very much regret, for duels of this
sort consume a great deal of time, and unless I am much mistaken it will
shortly rain cats and dogs.""It looks that way," said the sprite, "and it is for that very reason
that I do not wish to be interrupted again.Of course ruin stared father
in the face."whispered the major to Jimmieboy, who immediately
silenced him."Trade having fallen away," continued the sprite, "we had to draw upon
our savings for our bread and butter, and finally, when the last penny
was spent, we made up our minds to leave the moon district entirely and
try life on the dog-star, where, we were informed, people only had one
eye apiece, and every man had so much to do that it took all of his one
eye's time looking after his own business so that there wasn't any left
for him to spend on other people's business.It seemed to my father that
in a place like this there was a splendid opening for him.""Renting out his extra eye to blind men," roared the sprite.Jimmieboy fell off the rock with laughter, and the major, angry at being
so neatly caught, rose up and walked away but immediately returned."If this wasn't a duel I wouldn't stay here another minute," he said."But you can't put me to flight that way."The question now came up as to how we should get to the dog-star,"
resumed the sprite."I should think they'd have been so glad you were leaving they'd have
paid your fare," said the major, but the sprite paid no attention."There was no regular stage line between the moon and the dog-star,"
said he, "and we had only two chances of really getting there, and they
were both so slim you could count their ribs.One was by getting aboard
the first comet that was going that way, and the other was by jumping.The trouble with the first chance was that as far as any one knew there
wasn't a comet expected to go in the direction of the dog-star for eight
million years--which was rather a long time for a starving family to
wait, and besides we had read of so many accidents in the moon papers
about people being injured while trying to board comets in motion that
we were a little timid about it.My father and I could have managed
very well; but mother might not have--ladies can't even get on horse
cars in motion without getting hurt, you know.It's a pretty big jump
from the moon to the dog-star, and if you don't aim yourself right you
are apt to miss it, and either fall into space or land somewhere else
where you don't want to go.For instance, a cousin of mine
who lived on Mars wanted to visit us when we lived at Twinkleville, but
he was too mean to pay his fare, thinking he could jump it cheaper.Well, he jumped and where do you suppose he landed?"He didn't come
anywhere near Twinkleville, although he supposed that he was aimed in
the right direction.""Will you tell me how you know he's falling yet?"asked the major, who
didn't seem to believe this part of the sprite's story.I saw him yesterday through a telescope," replied the
sprite."And he looked very tired, too," said the sprite."Though as a matter of
fact he doesn't have to exert himself any.All he has to do is fall,
and, once you get started, falling is the easiest thing in the world.But of course with the remembrance of my cousin's mistake in our minds,
we didn't care so much about making the jump, and we kept putting it off
and putting it off until finally some wretched people had a law made
abolishing us from the moon entirely, which meant that we had to leave
inside of twenty-four hours; so we packed up our trunks with the few
possessions we had left and threw them off toward the dog-star; then
mother and father took hold of hands and jumped and I was to come along
after them with some of the baggage that we hadn't got ready in time."According to my father's instructions I watched him carefully as he
sped through space to see whether he had started right, and to my great
joy I observed that he had--that very shortly both he and mother would
arrive safely on the dog-star--but alas!My joy was soon turned to
grief, for a terrible thing happened.Our great heavy family trunk that
had been dispatched first, and with truest aim, landed on the head of
the King of the dog-star, stove his crown in and nearly killed him.Hardly had the king risen up from the ground when he was again knocked
down by my poor father, who, utterly powerless to slow up or switch
himself to one side, landed precisely as the trunk had landed on the
monarch's head, doing quite as much more damage as the trunk had done in
the beginning.When added to these mishaps a shower of hat-boxes and
hand-bags, marked with our family name, fell upon the Lord Chief
Justice, the Prime Minister and the Heir Apparent, my parents were
arrested and thrown into prison and I decided that the dog-star was no
place for me.Wild with grief, and without looking to see where I was
going, nor in fact caring much, I gave a running leap out into space and
finally through some good fortune landed here on this earth which I have
found quite good enough for me ever since."Here the sprite paused and looked at Jimmieboy as much as to say, "How
is that for a tale of adventure?"cried the major, "Isn't it enough?"I don't see how he could have jumped
so many years before the world was made and yet land on the world.""I was five thousand years on the jump," explained the sprite."It was leap-year when you started, wasn't it?"asked the major, with a
sarcastic smile.asked Jimmieboy,
signaling the major to be quiet.I am afraid they got into serious
trouble.It's a very serious thing to knock a king down with a trunk and
land on his head yourself the minute he gets up again," sighed the
sprite."But didn't you tell me your parents were unfairies?"put in Jimmieboy,
eying the sprite distrustfully."Yes; but they were only my adopted parents," explained the sprite."They were a very rich old couple with lots of money and no children, so
I adopted them not knowing that they were unfairies.When they died they
left me all their bad habits, and their money went to found a storeroom
for worn out lawn-mowers."Well that's a pretty good story," said Jimmieboy."Yes," said the sprite, with a pleased smile."And the best part of it
is it's all true."CHAPTER X.

THE MAJOR'S TALE."A great many years ago when I was a souvenir spoon," said the major, "I
belonged to a very handsome and very powerful potentate.""I didn't quite understand what it was you said you were," said the
sprite, bending forward as if to hear better."At the beginning of my story I was a souvenir spoon," returned the
major."Did you begin your career as a spoon?""I did not, sir," replied the major."I began my career as a nugget in a
lead mine where I was found by the king of whom I have just spoken, and
on his return home with me he gave me to his wife who sent me out to a
lead smith's and had me made over into a souvenir spoon--and a mighty
handsome spoon I was too.I had a poem engraved on me that said:

    'Aka majo te roo li sah,
     Pe mink y rali mis tebah.'Rather pretty thought, don't you think so?"added the major as he
completed the couplet.said the sprite, with a knowing shake of his head."Well, I don't understand it at all," said Jimmieboy."Ask this native of Twinkleville what it means," observed the major with
a snicker."He says it's a pretty thought, so of course he understands
it--though I assure you I don't, for it doesn't mean anything.I made it
up, this very minute."It was quite evident that he had fallen into
the trap the major had set for him."I was only fooling," he said, with a sickly attempt at a smile."I think perhaps the happiest time of my life was during the hundreds of
years that I existed in the royal museum as a spoon," resumed the major."I was brought into use only on state occasions.When the King of
Mangapore gave a state banquet to other kings in the neighborhood I was
the spoon that was used to ladle out the royal broth."Here the major paused to smack his lips, and then a small tear appeared
in one corner of his eye and trickled slowly down the side of his nose."I always weep," he said, as soon as he could speak, "when I think of
that broth.Here is what it was made of:

    'Seven pies of sweetest mince,
     Then a ripe and mellow quince,
         Then a quart of tea.Then a pint of cinnamon,
     Next a roasted apple, done
         Brown as brown can be.Add of orange juice, a gill,
     And a sugared daffodil,
         Then a yellow yam.Sixty-seven strawberries
     Should be added then to these,
         And a pot of jam.Mix with maple syrup and
     Let it in the ice-box stand
         Till it's good and cold--
     Throw a box of raisins in,
     Stir it well--just make it spin--
         Till it looks like gold.'"What a dish it was, and I, I used to be
dipped into a tureen full of it sixteen times at every royal feast,
and before the war we had royal feasts on an average of three times
a day."cried Jimmieboy, his mouth watering to
think of it."Three a day until the unhappy war broke out
which destroyed all my happiness, and resulted in the downfall of
sixty-four kings.""How on earth did such a war as that ever happen to be fought?""I am sorry to say," replied the major, sadly, "that I was the innocent
cause of it all.It was on the king's birthday that war was declared.He
used to have magnificent birthday parties, quite like those that boys
like Jimmieboy here have, only instead of having a cake with a candle in
it for each year, King Fuzzywuz used to have one guest for each year,
and one whole cake for each guest.On his twenty-first birthday he had
twenty-one guests; on his thirtieth, thirty, and so on; and at every one
of these parties I used to be passed around to be admired, I was so very
handsome and valuable."said the sprite, with a sneering laugh."The idea of a lead
spoon being valuable!""If you had ever been able to get into the society of kings," the major
answered, with a great deal of dignity, "you would know that on the
table of a monarch lead is much more rare than silver and gold.It was
this fact that made me so overpoweringly valuable, and it is not
surprising that a great many of the kings who used to come to these
birthday parties should become envious of Fuzzywuz and wish they owned a
treasure like myself.One very old king died of envy because of me, and
his heir-apparent inherited his father's desire to possess me to such a
degree that he too pined away and finally disappeared entirely.Didn't die, you know, as you would, but
vanished."So it went on for years, and finally on his sixty-fourth birthday King
Fuzzywuz gave his usual party, and sixty-four of the choicest kings in
the world were invited.They every one came, the feast was made ready,
and just as the guests took their places around the table, the broth
with me lying at the side of the tureen was brought in.The kings all
took their crowns off in honor of my arrival, when suddenly pouf!a gust
of wind came along and blew out every light in the hall.All was
darkness, and in the midst of it I felt myself grabbed by the handle and
shoved hastily into an entirely strange pocket.'Turn off the wind and bring
a light.'"The slaves hastened to do as they were told, and in less time than it
takes to tell it, light and order were restored.I could see it very plainly through a button-hole in the
cloak of the potentate who had seized me and hidden me in his pocket.Fuzzywuz immediately discovered that I was missing.he roared to the head-waiter,
who, though he was an African of the blackest hue, turned white as a
sheet with fear."'It was in the broth, oh, Nepotic Fuzzywuz, King of the Desert and most
noble Potentate of the Sand Dunes, when I, thy miserable servant,
brought it into the gorgeous banqueting hall and set it here before
thee, who art ever my most Serene and Egotistic Master,' returned the
slave, trembling with fear and throwing himself flat upon the
dining-hall floor.Do
spoons take wings unto themselves and fly away?Are they tadpoles that
they develop legs and hop as frogs from our royal presence?Do spoons
evapidate----'

"'Evaporate, my dear,' suggested the queen in a whisper.'Do spoons evaporate like water in the
sun?Do they raise sails like sloops of war and thunder noiselessly out
of sight?Thou hast stolen it and thou must bear the penalty of
thy predilection----'

"'Dereliction,' whispered the queen, impatiently."'He knows what I mean,' roared the king, 'or if he doesn't he will when
his head is cut off.'""Is that what all those big words meant?""As I remember the occurrence, it is," returned the major."What the
king really meant was always uncertain; he always used such big words
and rarely got them right.Reprehensibility and tremulousness were great
favorites of his, though I don't believe he ever knew what they meant.But, to continue my story, at this point the king rose and sharpening
the carving knife was about to behead the slave's head off when the
potentate who had me in his pocket cried out:

"'Hold, oh Fuzzywuz!I saw the spoon myself at the
side of yon tureen when it was brought hither.'"'Then,' returned the king, 'it has been percolated----'

"'Peculated,' whispered the queen."'That's what I said,' retorted Fuzzywuz, angrily.'The spoon has been
speculated by some one of our royal brethren at this board.The point to
be liquidated now is, who has done this deed.A
guard about the palace gates--and lock the doors and bar the windows.I am sorry to say, that every king in this room
save only myself and my friend Prince Bigaroo, who at the risk of his
kingly dignity deigned to come to the rescue of my slave, must repeal--I
should say reveal--the contents of his pockets.Prince Bigaroo must be
innocent or he would not have ejaculated as he hath.'"You see," said the major, in explanation, "Bigaroo having stolen me was
smart enough to see how it would be if he spoke.A guilty person in nine
cases out of ten would have kept silent and let the slave suffer.So
Bigaroo escaped; but all the others were searched and of course I was
not found.Fuzzywuz was wild with sorrow and anger, and declared that
unless I was returned within ten minutes he would wage war upon, and
utterly destroy, every king in the place.The kings all turned
pale--even Bigaroo's cheek grew white, but having me he was determined
to keep me and so the war began.""Why didn't you speak and save the innocent kings?""Did you ever see a spoon with a
tongue?"He evidently had never seen a spoon with a
tongue."The war was a terrible one," said the major, resuming his story."One
by one the kings were destroyed, and finally only Bigaroo remained, and
Fuzzywuz not having found me in the treasures of the others, finally
came to see that it was Bigaroo who had stolen me.So he turned his
forces toward the wicked monarch, defeated his army, and set fire to his
palace.In that fire I was destroyed as a souvenir spoon and became a
lump of lead once more, lying in the ruins for nearly a thousand years,
when I was sold along with a lot of iron and other things to a junk
dealer.He in turn sold me to a ship-maker, who worked me over into a
sounding lead for a steamer he had built.On my first trip out I was
sent overboard to see how deep the ocean was.I fell in between two
huge rocks down on the ocean's bed and was caught, the rope connecting
me with the ship snapped, and there I was, twenty thousand fathoms under
the sea, lost, as I supposed, forever.The effect of the salt water upon
me was very much like that of hair restorer on some people's heads.I
began to grow a head of green hair--seaweed some people call it--and to
this fact, strangely enough, I owed my escape from the water.A sea-cow
who used to graze about where I lay, thinking that I was only a tuft of
grass gathered me in one afternoon and swallowed me without blinking,
and some time after, the cow having been caught and killed by some giant
fishermen, I was found by the wife of one of the men when the great cow
was about to be cooked.These giants were very strange people who
inhabited an island out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which was
gradually sinking into the water with the weight of the people on it,
and which has now entirely disappeared.There wasn't one of the
inhabitants that was less than one hundred feet tall, and in those days
they used to act as light-houses for each other at night.They had but
one eye apiece, and when that was open it used to flash just like a
great electric light, and they'd take turns at standing up in the
middle of the island all night long and turning round and round and
round until you'd think they'd drop with dizziness.I staid with these
people, I should say, about forty years, when one morning two of the
giants got disputing as to which of them could throw a stone the
farthest.One of them said he could throw a pebble two thousand miles,
and the other said he could throw one all the way round the world.At
this the first one laughed and jeered, and to prove that he had told the
truth the second grabbed up what he thought was a pebble, but which
happened to be me and threw me from him with all his force."And sad to say I
killed the giant who threw me," returned the major."I went around the
world so swiftly that when I got back to the island the poor fellow
hadn't had time to get out of my way, and as I came whizzing along I
struck him in the back, went right through him, and leaving him dead on
the island went on again and finally fell into a great gun manufactory
in Massachusetts where I was smelted over into a bullet, and sent to the
war.I think I must have
killed off half a dozen regiments of his enemies, and between you and
me, General Washington said I was his favorite bullet, and added that as
long as he had me with him he wasn't afraid of anybody."Here the major paused a minute to smile at the sprite who was beginning
to look a little blue.It was rather plain, the sprite thought, that the
major was getting the best of the duel.How long did you stay with George
Washington?""I'd never have left him if he hadn't
ordered me to do work that I wasn't made for.When a bullet goes to war
he doesn't want to waste himself on ducks.I wanted to go after hostile
generals and majors and cornet players, and if Mr.Washington had used
me for them I'd have hit home every time, but instead of that he took me
off duck shooting one day and actually asked me to knock over a
miserable wild bird he happened to want.He
insisted, and I said,'very well, General, fire away.'He fired, the
duck laughed, and I simply flew off into the woods on the border of the
bay and rested there for nearly a hundred years.The rest of my story
is soon told.I lay where I had fallen until six years ago when I was
picked up by a small boy who used me for a sinker to go fishing with,
after which I found my way into the smelting pot once more, and on the
Fifteenth of November, 1892, I became what I am, Major Blueface, the
handsomest soldier, the bravest warrior, the most talented tin poet that
ever breathed."A long silence followed the completion of the major's story.Which of
the two he liked the better Jimmieboy could not make up his mind, and he
hoped his two companions would be considerate enough not to ask him to
decide between them."I thought they had to be true stories," said the sprite, gloomily."I
don't think it's fair to tell stories like yours--the idea of your being
thrown one and a half times around the world!""It's just as true as yours, anyhow," retorted the major, "but if you
want to begin all over again and tell another I'm ready for you.""We'll leave it to Jimmieboy as it is.""I don't know about that, major," said Jimmieboy."I think you are just
about even."asked the sprite, his face beaming with
pleasure."We'll settle it this way: we'll give five points
to the one who told the best, five points to the one who told the
longest, and five points to the one who told the shortest story.As the
stories are equally good you both get five points for that.The major's
was the longest, I think, so he gets five more, but so does the sprite
because his was the shortest.That makes you both ten, so you both win.""Yes," said the sprite, squeezing Jimmieboy's hand affectionately, "and
so do I."Which after all, I think, was the best way to decide a duel of that
sort."Well, now that that is settled," said the major with a sigh of relief,
"I suppose we had better start off and see whether Fortyforefoot will
attend to this business of getting the provisions for us.""The major is right there, Jimmieboy.You have
delayed so long on the way that it is about time you did something, and
the only way I know of for you to do it is by getting hold of
Fortyforefoot.If you wanted an apple pie and there was nothing in sight
but a cart-wheel he would change it into an apple pie for you.""That's all very well," replied Jimmieboy, "but I'm not going to call on
any giant who'd want to eat me.You might just as well understand that
right off.I'll try on your invisible coat and if that makes me
invisible I'll go.If it doesn't we'll have to try some other plan.""That is the prudent thing to do," said the major, nodding his approval
to the little general."As my poem tries to teach, it is always wise to
use your eyes--or look before you leap.The way it goes is this:

    'If you are asked to make a jump,
     Be careful lest you prove a gump--
         Awake or e'en in sleep--
     Don't hesitate the slightest bit
     To show that you've at least the wit
         To look before you leap.Why, in a dream one night, I thought
     A fellow told me that I ought
         To jump to Labrador.I did not look but blindly hopped,
     And where do you suppose I stopped?I do not say, had I been wise
     Enough that time to use my eyes--
         As I've already said--
     To Labrador I would have got:
     But this _is_ certain, I would not
         Have tumbled out of bed.'"The moral of which is, be careful how you go into things, and if you
are not certain that you are coming out all right don't go into them,"
added the major."Why, when I was a mouse----"

"Oh, come, major--you couldn't have been a mouse," interrupted the
sprite."You've just told us all about what you've been in the past, and
you couldn't have been all that and a mouse too.""So I have," said the major, with a smile."I'd forgotten that, and you
are right, too.I should have put what I
was going to say differently.If I had ever been a mouse--that's the way
it should be--if I had ever been a mouse and had been foolish enough to
stick my head into a mouse-trap after a piece of cheese without knowing
that I should get it out again, I should not have been here to-day, in
all likelihood.Try on the invisible
coat, Jimmieboy, and let's see how it works before you risk calling on
Fortyforefoot.""Here it is," said the sprite, holding out his hands with apparently
nothing in them.Jimmieboy laughed a little, it seemed so odd to have a person say "here
it is" and yet not be able to see the object referred to.He reached out
his hand, however, to take the coat, relying upon the sprite's statement
that it was there, and was very much surprised to find that his hand did
actually touch something that felt like a coat, and in fact was a coat,
though entirely invisible."Shall I help you on with it?""Perhaps you'd better," said Jimmieboy."It feels a little small for
me.""That's what I was afraid of," said the sprite."You see it covers me
all over from head to foot--that is the coat covers all but my head and
the hood covers that--but you are very much taller than I am."Here Jimmieboy, having at last got into the coat and buttoned it about
him, had the strange sensation of seeing all of himself disappear
excepting his head and legs.These remaining uncovered were of course
still in sight.laughed the major, merrily, as Jimmieboy walked around."That is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw.You're nothing but a head
and pair of legs."Jimmieboy smiled and placed the hood over his head and the major roared
louder than ever.That's funnier still--now
you're nothing but a pair of legs.Take it off quick or
I'll die with laughter.""I'm afraid it won't do, Spritey," he said."Fortyforefoot would see my
legs and if he caught them I'd be lost.""That's a fact," said the sprite, thoughtfully."The coat is almost two
feet too short for you.""It's more than two feet too short," laughed the major."It's two whole
legs too short.""This is no time for joking," said the sprite."We've too much to talk
about to use our mouths for laughing.""I won't get off any more, or if I do they
won't be the kind to make you laugh.But I say, boys," he added, "I have a scheme.It is of course the scheme
of a soldier and may be attended by danger, but if it is successful all
the more credit to the one who succeeds.We three people can attack
Fortyforefoot openly, capture him, and not let him go until he provides
us with the provisions.""That sounds lovely," sneered the sprite."But I'd like to know some of
the details of this scheme.It is easy enough to say attack him, capture
him and not let him go, but the question is, how shall we do all this?""It ought to be easy," returned the major."There are only three things
to be done.A kitten can attack an elephant if it wants to.The second is to capture
him, which, while it seems hard, is not really so if the attack is
properly made."Clear as a fog," put in the sprite."Now there are three of us--Jimmieboy, Spriteyboy and Yourstrulyboy,"
continued the major, "so what could be more natural than that we should
divide up these three operations among us?Therefore I propose
that Jimmieboy here shall attack Fortyforefoot; the sprite shall capture
him and throw him into a dungeon cell and I will crown the work by not
letting him go.""Jimmieboy and I take all the danger I
notice.""I am utterly unselfish about
it.I am willing to put myself in the background and let you have all
the danger and most of the glory.I only come in at the very end--but I
don't mind that.I have had glory enough for ten life-times, so why
should I grudge you this one little bit of it?My feelings in regard to
glory will be found on the fortieth page of Leaden Lyrics or the Ballads
of Ben Bullet--otherwise myself.The verses read as follows:

    'Though glory, it must be confessed,
       Is satisfying stuff,
     Upon my laurels let me rest
       For I have had enough.Ne'er was a glorier man than I,
       Ne'er shall a glorier be,
     Than, trembling reader, you'll espy--
       When haply you spy me.So bring no more--for while 'tis good
       To have, 'tis also plain
     A bit of added glory would
       Be apt to make me vain.'And I don't want to be vain," concluded the major."Well, I don't want any of your glory," said the sprite, "and if I know
Jimmieboy I don't think he does either.If you want to reverse your
order of things and do the dangerous part of the work yourself, we will
do all in our power to make your last hours comfortable, and I will see
to it that the newspapers tell how bravely you died, but we can't go
into the scheme any other way.""You talk as if you were the general's prime minister, or his nurse,"
retorted the major, "whereas in reality I, being his chief of staff, am
they if anybody are."Here the major blushed a little because he was not quite sure of his
grammar.Neither of his companions seemed to notice the mixture,
however, and so he continued:

"General, it is for you to say.Shall my plan go or shall she stay?""Well, I think myself, major, that it is a little too dangerous for me,
and if any other plan could be made I'd like it better," answered
Jimmieboy, anxious to soothe the major's feelings which were evidently
getting hurt again."Suppose I go back and order the soldiers to attack
Fortyforefoot and bring him in chains to me?""Couldn't be done," said the sprite."The minute the chains were clapped
on him he would change them into doughnuts and eat them all up.""Yes," put in the major, "and the chances are he would turn the soldiers
into a lot of toy balloons on a string and then cut the string.""He couldn't do that," said the sprite, "because he can't turn people or
animals into anything."Well, I think the best thing to do would be for me to change myself
into a giant bigger than he is," said the sprite."Then I could put you
and the major in my pockets and call upon Fortyforefoot and ask him, in
a polite way, to turn some pebbles and sticks and other articles into
the things we want, and, if he won't do it except he is paid, we'll pay
him if we can.""What do you propose to pay him with?""I suppose
you'll hand him half a dozen checkerberries and tell him if he'll turn
them into ten one dollar bills he'll have ten dollars."You can't tempt Fortyforefoot with
money.It is only by offering him something to eat that we can hope to
get his assistance."And you'll request him to turn a handful of pine cones into a dozen
turkeys on toast, I presume?"I shall simply offer to let him have
you for dinner--you will serve up well in croquettes--Blueface
croquettes--eh, Jimmieboy?"The poor major turned white with fear and rage.At first he felt
inclined to slay the sprite on the spot, and then it suddenly flashed
across his mind that before he could do it the sprite might really turn
himself into a giant and do with him as he had said.So he contented
himself with turning pale and giving a sickly smile."That would be a good joke on me," he said.Sprite, I don't think I would enjoy it, and after all I have a sort of
notion that I would disagree with Fortyforefoot--which would be
extremely unfortunate.I know I should rest like lead on his
digestion--and that would make him angry with you and I should be
sacrificed for nothing.""Well, I wouldn't consent to that anyhow," said Jimmieboy."I love the
major too much to----"

"So do we all," interrupted the sprite."Why even I love the major and I
wouldn't let anybody eat him for anything--no, sir!--not if I were
offered a whole vanilla eclaire would I permit the major to be eaten.I will turn myself into a giant
twice as big as Fortyforefoot; I will place you and the major in my
pockets and then I will call upon him.He will be so afraid of me that
he will do almost anything I ask him to, but to make him give us the
very best things he can make I would rather deal gently with him, and
instead of forcing him to make the peaches and cherries I'll offer to
trade you two fellows off for the things we need.He will be pleased
enough at the chance to get anything so good to eat as you look, and
he'll prepare everything for us, and he will put you down stairs in the
pantry.Then I will tell him stories, and some of the major's jokes, to
make him sleepy, and when finally he dozes off I will steal the pantry
key and set you free."It's a very good plan unless Fortyforefoot should find us so toothsome
looking that he would want to eat us raw.We may be nothing more than
fruit for him, you know, and truly I don't want to be anybody's apple,"
said Jimmieboy."You are quite correct there, general," said the major, with a chuckle."In fact, I'm quite sure he'd think you and I were fruit because being
two we are necessarily a pear.""It won't happen," said the sprite."He isn't likely to think you are
fruit and even if he does I won't let him eat you.I'll keep him from
doing it if I have to eat you myself.""Oh, of course, then, with a kind promise like that there is nothing
left for us to do but accept your proposition," said the
major."As Ben Bullet says:

    'When only one thing can be done--
       If people only knew it--
     The wisest course beneath the sun
       Is just to go and do it.'""I'm willing to take my chances," said Jimmieboy, "if after I see what
kind of a giant you can turn yourself into I think you are terrible
enough to frighten another giant.""Well, just watch me," said the sprite, taking off his coat."And mind,
however terrifying I may become, don't you get frightened, because I
won't hurt you.""Go ahead," said the major, valiantly."Wait until we get scared before
talking like that to us."'Bazam, bazam,
     A sprite I am,
     Bazoo, bazee,
     A giant I'd be.'"Then there came a terrific noise; the trees about the little group shook
to the very last end of their roots, all grew dark as night, and as
quickly grew light again.In the returning light Jimmieboy saw looming
up before him a fearful creature, eighty feet high, clad in a
magnificent suit embroidered with gold and silver, a fierce mustache
upon his lip, and dangling at his side was a heavy sword.It was the sprite now transformed into a giant--a terrible-looking
fellow, though to Jimmieboy he was not terrible because the boy knew
that the dreadful creature was only his little friend in disguise.came a bellowing voice from above the trees.I'm sure you'll do, and I am ready,"
said Jimmieboy, with a laugh.But there came no answer, and Jimmieboy, looking about him to see why
the major made no reply, was just in time to see that worthy soldier's
coat-tails disappearing down the road.The major was running away as fast as he could go."You've frightened him pretty well, Spritey," said Jimmieboy, with a
laugh, as the major passed out of sight."But you don't seem a bit afraid.""I'm not--though I think I should be if I didn't know who you are,"
returned Jimmieboy."Well, I need to be if I am to get the best of Fortyforefoot, but, I
say, you mustn't call me Spritey now that I am a giant.It won't do to
call me by any name that would show Fortyforefoot who I really am," said
the sprite, with a warning shake of his head."Bludgeonhead is my name now," replied the sprite."Benjamin B.
Bludgeonhead is my full name, but you know me well enough to call me
plain Bludgeonhead.""All right, plain Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, "I'll do as you
say--and now don't you think we'd better be starting along?""Yes," said Bludgeonhead, reaching down and grabbing hold of Jimmieboy
with his huge hand."We'll start right away, and until we come in sight
of Fortyforefoot's house I think perhaps you'll be more comfortable if
you ride on my shoulder instead of in my coat-pocket.""Thank you very much," said Jimmieboy, as Bludgeonhead lifted him up
from the ground and set him lightly as a feather on his shoulder."I think I'd like to be
as tall as this all the time, Bludgeonhead.What a great thing it would
be on parade days to be as tall as this.Why I can see miles and miles
of country from here.""Yes, it's pretty fine--but I don't think I'd care to be so tall
always," returned Bludgeonhead, as he stepped over a great broad river
that lay in his path."It makes one very uppish to be as high in the air
as this; and you'd be all the time looking down on your friends, too,
which would be so unpleasant for your friends that they wouldn't have
anything to do with you after a while.I'm going to
jump over this mountain in front of us."Here Bludgeonhead drew back a little and then took a short run, after
which he leaped high in the air, and he and Jimmieboy sailed easily over
the great hills before them, and then alighted safe and sound on the
other side.cried Jimmieboy, clapping his hands with glee."I hope there are lots more hills like that to be jumped over.""No, there aren't," said Bludgeonhead, "but if you like it so much I'll
go back and do it again."Bludgeonhead turned back and jumped over the mountain half a dozen times
until Jimmieboy was satisfied and then he resumed his journey."This," he said, after trudging along in silence for some time, "this is
Fortyforefoot Valley, and in a short time we shall come to the giant's
castle; but meanwhile I want you to see what a wonderful place this is.The valley itself will give you a better idea of Fortyforefoot's great
power as a magician than anything else that I know of.Do you know what
this place was before he came here?""It was a great big hole in the ground," returned Bludgeonhead.Fortyforefoot liked the situation because it was
surrounded by mountains and nobody ever wanted to come here because sand
pits aren't worth visiting.There wasn't a tree or a speck of a green
thing anywhere in sight--nothing but yellow sand glaring in the sun all
day and sulking in the moon all night."It's all covered with beautiful trees and
gardens and brooks now," said Jimmieboy, which was quite true, for the
Fortyforefoot Valley was a perfect paradise to look at, filled with
everything that was beautiful in the way of birds and trees and flowers
and water courses."How could he make the trees and flowers grow in dry
hot sand like that?""By his magic power, of course," answered Bludgeonhead."He filled up a
good part of the sand pit with stones that he found about here, and then
he changed one part of the desert into a pond so that he could get all
the water he wanted.Then he took a square mile of sand and changed
every grain of it into blades of grass.Other portions he transformed
into forests until finally simply by the wonderful power he has to
change one thing into another he got the place into its present shape.""But the birds, how did he make them?""He didn't," said Bludgeonhead.They saw
what a beautiful place this was and they simply moved in."Bludgeonhead paused a moment in his walk and set Jimmieboy down on the
ground again."I think I'll take a rest here before going on.We are very near to
Fortyforefoot's castle now," he said."I'll sit down here for a few
moments and sharpen my sword and get in good shape for a fight if one
becomes necessary.This place is full of
traps for just such fellows as you who come in here.That's the way
Fortyforefoot catches them for dinner."So Jimmieboy staid close by Bludgeonhead's side and was very much
entertained by all that went on around him.He saw the most wonderful
birds imaginable, and great bumble-bees buzzed about in the flowers
gathering honey by the quart.Once a great jack-rabbit, three times as
large as he was, came rushing out of the woods toward him, and Jimmieboy
on stooping to pick up a stone to throw at Mr.Bunny to frighten him
away, found that all the stones in that enchanted valley were precious.He couldn't help laughing outright when he discovered that the stone he
had thrown at the rabbit was a huge diamond as big as his fist, and that
even had he stopped to choose a less expensive missile he would have had
to confine his choice to pearls, rubies, emeralds, and other gems of the
rarest sort.And then he noticed that what he thought was a rock upon
which he and Bludgeonhead were sitting was a massive nugget of pure
yellow gold.This lead him on to inspect the trees about him and then he
discovered a most absurd thing.Fortyforefoot's extravagance had
prompted him to make all his pine trees of the most beautifully polished
and richly inlaid mahogany; every one of the weeping willows was made of
solid oak, ornamented and carved until the eye wearied of its beauty,
and as for the birds in the trees, their nests were made not of stray
wisps of straw and hay stolen from the barns and fields, but of the
softest silk, rich in color and lined throughout with eiderdown, the
mere sight of which could hardly help being restful to a tired bird--or
boy either, for that matter, Jimmieboy thought."Did he make all this out of sand?All these jewels and magnificent
carvings?""Simply took up a handful of sand and tossed
it up in the air and whatever he commanded it to be it became.But the
most wonderful thing in this place is his spring.He made what you might
call a 'Wish Dipper' out of an old tin cup.Then he dug a hole and
filled it with sand which he commanded to become liquid, and, when the
sand heard him say that, it turned to liquid, but the singular thing
about it is that as Fortyforefoot didn't say what kind of liquid it
should be, it became any kind.So now if any one is thirsty and wants a
glass of cider all he has to do is to dip the wish dipper into the
spring and up comes cider.If he wants lemonade up comes lemonade.If he
wants milk up comes milk.As Bludgeonhead spoke these words Jimmieboy was startled to hear
something very much like an approaching footstep far down the road.he asked, seizing Bludgeonhead by the hand."Yes, I did," replied Bludgeonhead, in a whisper."It sounded to me like
Fortyforefoot's step, too.""I'd better hide, hadn't I?"Climb inside
my coat and snuggle down out of sight in my pocket.We musn't let him
see you yet awhile."Jimmieboy did as he was commanded, and found the pocket a very
comfortable place, only it was a little stuffy."It's pretty hot in here," he whispered."Well, look up on the left hand corner of the outer side of the pocket
and you'll find two flaps that are buttoned up," replied Bludgeonhead,
softly.One will let in all the air you want, and the
other will enable you to peep out and see Fortyforefoot without his
seeing you."In a minute the buttons were found and the flaps opened.Everything
happened as Bludgeonhead said it would, and in a minute Jimmieboy,
peering out through the hole in the cloak, saw Fortyforefoot
approaching.The owner of the beautiful valley seemed very angry when he caught sight
of Bludgeonhead sitting on his property, and hastening up to him, he
cried:

"What business have you here in the Valley of Fortyforefoot?"Jimmieboy shrank back into one corner of the pocket, a little overcome
with fear.Fortyforefoot was larger and more terrible than he thought."I am not good at riddles," said Bludgeonhead, calmly."That is at
riddles of that sort.If you had asked me the difference between a duck
and a garden rake I should have told you that a duck has no teeth and
can eat, while a rake has plenty of teeth and can't eat.But when you
ask me what business I have here I am forced to say that I can't say.""You are a very bright sort of a giant," sneered Fortyforefoot."The fact is I can't help being bright.My
mother polishes me every morning with a damp chamois.""Do you know to whom you are speaking?"asked Fortyforefoot,
threateningly."No; not having been introduced to you, I can't say I know you,"
returned Bludgeonhead.You are Anklehigh, the
Dwarf."At this Fortyforefoot turned purple with rage."I'll right quickly teach thee a
lesson thou rash fellow."Fortyforefoot strode up close to Bludgeonhead, whose size he could not
have guessed because Bludgeonhead had been sitting down all this time
and was pretty well covered over by his cloak.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD SHOWS JIMMIEBOY TO FORTYFOREFOOT.[Blank Page]

"I'll take thee by thine ear and toss thee to the moon," he cried,
reaching out his hand to make good his word."Nonsense, Anklehigh," returned Bludgeonhead, calmly.No dwarf can fight with a giant of my size.""But I am not the dwarf Anklehigh," shrieked Fortyforefoot."And I am Bludgeonhead," returned the other, rising and towering way
above the owner of the valley.cried Fortyforefoot, falling on his knees in abject
terror.Pardon, O, Bludgeonhead.I did not know
you when I was so hasty as to offer to throw you to the moon.I thought
you were--er--that you were--er----"

"More easily thrown," suggested Bludgeonhead."Yes--yes--that was it," stammered Fortyforefoot."And now, to show that
you have forgiven me, I want you to come to my castle and have dinner
with me.""I'll be very glad to," replied Bludgeonhead."What are you going to
have for dinner?""Anything you wish," said Fortyforefoot."I was going to have a very
plain dinner to-night because for to-morrow's dinner I have invited my
brother Fortythreefoot and his wife Fortytwoinch to have a little
special dish I have been so fortunate as to secure.""Oh, only a sniveling creature I caught in one of my traps this
afternoon.He was a soldier, and he wasn't very brave about being
caught, but I judge from looking at him that he will make good eating,"
said Fortyforefoot."I couldn't gather from him who he was.He had on a
military uniform, but he behaved less like a warrior than ever I
supposed a man could.It seems from his story that he was engaged upon
some secret mission, and on his way back to his army, he stumbled over
and into one of my game traps where I found him.He begged me to let him
go, but that was out of the question.I haven't had a soldier to eat for
four years, so I took him to the castle, had him locked up in the
ice-box, and to-morrow we shall eat him."asked Bludgeonhead, thoughtfully.He told me so many names that I didn't
believe he really owned any of them," said Fortyforefoot."All I could
really learn about him was that he was as brave as a lion, and that if I
would spare him he would write me a poem a mile long every day of my
life.""Very attractive offer, that," said Bludgeonhead, with a smile."Yes; but I couldn't do it.I wouldn't miss eating him for anything,"
replied Fortyforefoot, smacking his lips, hungrily."I'd give anything
anybody'd ask, too, if I could find another as good.""Well, now, I thought you
would, and that is really what I have come here for.I have in my pocket
here a real live general that I have captured.Now between you and me, I
don't eat generals.I don't care for them--they fight so.I prefer
preserved cherries and pickled peaches and--er--strawberry jam and
powdered sugar and almonds, and other things like that, you know, and it
occurred to me that if I let you have the general you would supply me
with what I needed of the others.""You have come to the right place, Bludgeonhead," said Fortyforefoot,
eagerly."I'll give you a million cans of jam, all the pickled peaches
and other things you can carry if this general you speak about is a fine
specimen.""Well, here he is," said Bludgeonhead, hauling Jimmieboy out of his
pocket--whispering to Jimmieboy at the same time not to be afraid
because he wouldn't let anything happen to him, and so of course
Jimmieboy felt perfectly safe, though a little excited."No," answered Bludgeonhead, putting Jimmieboy back into his pocket
again."If I ever do find another, though, you shall have him."This of course put Fortyforefoot in a tremendously good humor, and
before an hour had passed he had not only transformed pebbles and twigs
and leaves of trees and other small things into the provisions that the
tin soldiers needed, but he had also furnished horses and wagons enough
to carry them back to headquarters, and then Fortyforefoot accompanied
by Bludgeonhead entered the castle, where the proprietor demanded that
Jimmieboy should be given up to him.Bludgeonhead handed him over at once, and ten minutes later Jimmieboy
found himself locked up in the pantry.Hardly had he time to think over the strange events of the afternoon
when he heard a noise in the ice-box over in one corner of the pantry,
and on going there to see what was the cause of it he heard a familiar
voice repeating over and over again these mournful lines:

    "From Giant number one I ran--
       But O the sequel dire!I truly left a frying-pan
       And jumped into a fire.""Hullo in there," whispered Jimmieboy."The bravest man of my time," replied the voice in the ice-box."Major
Mortimer Carraway Blueface of the 'Jimmieboy Guards.'""Oh, I am so glad to find you again," cried Jimmieboy, throwing open the
ice-box door."I thought it was you the minute I heard your poetry.""You recognized the beauty of
the poem?""But you said you were in the fire when I
knew you were in the ice-box, and so of course----"

"Of course," said the major, with a frown."You remembered that when I
say one thing I mean another.Well, I'm glad to see you again, but why
did you desert me so cruelly?"For a moment Jimmieboy could say nothing, so surprised was he at the
major's question.Then he simply repeated it, his amazement very evident
in the tone of his voice."Why did we desert you so cruelly?"When two of my companions
in arms leave me, the way you and old Spriteyboy did, I think you ought
to make some explanation."But we didn't desert you," said Jimmieboy."No such idea ever entered
our minds.The minute Spritey turned into
Bludgeonhead you ran away just about as fast as your tin legs could
carry you--frightened to death evidently.""Jimmieboy," said the major, his voice husky with emotion, "any other
person than yourself would have had to fight a duel with me for casting
such a doubt as you have just cast upon my courage.The idea of me, of
I, of myself, Major Mortimer Carraway Blueface, the hero of a hundred
and eighty-seven real sham fights, the most poetic as well as the
handsomest man in the 'Jimmieboy Guards' being accused of running away!"I've been accused of dreadful things,
     Of wearing copper finger-rings,
     Of eating green peas with a spoon,
     Of wishing that I owned the moon,
     Of telling things that weren't the truth,
     Of having cut no wisdom tooth,
     In times of war of stealing buns,
     And fainting at the sound of guns,
     Yet never dreamed I'd see the day
     When it was thought I'd run away.Alack--O--well-a-day--alas!Alas--O--well-a-day--alack!Alas--alack--O--well-a-day!Aday--alas--O--lack-a-well--"

"Are you going to keep that up forever?""If you are
I'm going to get out.I've heard stupid poetry in this campaign, but
that's the worst yet.""I only wanted to show you what I could do in the way of a lamentation,"
said the major."If you've had enough I'll stop of course; but tell me,"
he added, sitting down upon a cake of ice, and crossing his legs, "how
on earth did you ever get hold of the ridiculous notion that I ran away
frightened?"The minute
the sprite was changed into Bludgeonhead I turned to speak to you, and
all I could see of you was your coat-tails disappearing around the
corner way down the road.""And just because my coat-tails behaved like that you put me down as a
coward?"I hurried
off; but not because I was afraid.I was simply going down the road to
see if I couldn't find a looking-glass so that Spriteyboy could see how
he looked as a giant.""That's a magnificent excuse," he said."I thought you'd think it was," said the major, with a pleased smile."And when I finally found that there weren't any mirrors to be had
along the road I went back, and you two had gone and left me."It's a great thing, sleep is, and I wrote the
lines off in two tenths of a fifth of a second.As I remember it, this
is the way they went:

    "SLEEP.Deserted by my friends I sit,
       And silently I weep,
     Until I'm wearied so by it,
     I lose my little store of wit;
       I nod and fall asleep.Then in my dreams my friends I spy--
       Once more are they my own.I cease to murmur and to cry,
     For then 'tis sure to be that I
       Forget I am alone.'Tis hence I think that sleep's the best
       Of friends that man has got--
      Not only does it bring him rest
     But makes him feel that he is blest
       With blessings he has not.""Why didn't you go to sleep if you felt that way?""I wanted to find you and I hadn't time.There was only time for me to
scratch that poem off on my mind and start to find you and Bludgeyboy,"
replied the major."His name isn't Bludgeyboy," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."Oh, yes, I forgot," said the major."It's a good name, too,
Bludgeonpate is.""How did you come to be captured by Fortyforefoot?"asked Jimmieboy,
after he had decided not to try to correct the major any more as to
Bludgeonhead's name."The idea of a miserable
ogre like Fortyforefoot capturing me, the most sagacitacious soldier of
modern times.I suppose you think I fell into one of his game traps?""That's what he said," said Jimmieboy."He said you acted in a very
curious way, too--promised him all sorts of things if he'd let you go.""That's just like those big, bragging giants," said the major.I came here of my own free will
and accord."Down here into this pantry and into the ice-chest?You can't fool me," said Jimmieboy."To meet you, of course," retorted the major.I knew it
was part of your scheme to come here.You and I were to be put into the
pantry and then old Bludgeyhat was to come and rescue us.I was the one
to make the scheme, wasn't I?"Sandra journeyed to the hallway.It was Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, who didn't know whether to
believe the major or not."That's just the way," said the major, indignantly, "he gets all the
credit just because he's big and I don't get any, and yet if you knew of
all the wild animals I've killed to get here to you, how I met
Fortyforefoot and bound him hand and foot and refused to let him go
unless he would permit me to spend a week in his ice-chest, for the sole
and only purpose that I wished to meet you again, you'd change your mind
mighty quick about me.""Did you ever see me in a real sham battle?""No, I never did," said Jimmieboy."Well, you'd better never," returned the major, "unless you want to be
frightened out of your wits.I have been called the living telescope,
sir, because when I begin to fight, in the fiercest manner possible, I
sort of lengthen out and sprout up into the air until I am taller than
any foe within my reach."queried Jimmieboy, with a puzzled air about him."Well, I should like to see it once," said Jimmieboy."Then you will never believe it," returned the major, "because you will
never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is
my son.Don't stare that way into the
fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,
etc.[Kaps, Bos and Mathilde discovered.]Clemens!----

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr.From a
dais across at the further end, the vigorous white head of Dr.Earle
dominated the company,--a strange company, of lounging Chinamen who
sucked at enormous bamboo pipes, or squinted aimlessly at the vertical
inscriptions on the walls, or wriggling about, stared at the
late-comers, nudged their neighbors, and pointed, with guttural
exclamations.The song had ended, and the padre was lifting up his
giant's voice.To Rudolph, the words had been mere sound and fury, but
for a compelling honesty that needed no translation.This man was not
preaching to heathen, but talking to men.His eyes had the look of one
who speaks earnestly of matters close at hand, direct, and simple.Along
the forms, another and another man forgot to plait his queue, or squirm,
or suck laboriously at his pipe.When
some waif from the outer labyrinth scuffed in, affable, impudent,
hailing his friends across the room, he made but a ripple of unrest,
and sank gaping among the others like a fish in a pool.Even Heywood sat listening--with more attention than respect, for once
he muttered, "Rot!"Toward the close, however, he leaned across and
whispered, "The old boy reels it off rather well to-night.Rudolph, for his part, sat watching and listening, surprised by a new
and curious thought.A band of huddled converts sang once more, in squealing discords, with
an air of sad, compulsory, and diabolic sarcasm.A few "inquirers"
slouched forward, and surrounding the tall preacher, questioned him
concerning the new faith.The last, a broad, misshapen fellow with
hanging jowls, was answered sharply.He stood arguing, received another
snub, and went out bawling and threatening, with the contorted face and
clumsy flourishes of some fabulous hero on a screen.The missionary approached smiling, but like a man who has finished the
day's work."That fellow--Good-evening: and welcome to our Street Chapel, Mr.Hackh--That fellow," he glanced after the retreating figure, "he's a
lesson in perseverance, gentlemen.A merchant, well-to-do: he has a
lawsuit coming on--notorious--and tries to join us for protection.Cheaper to buy a little belief, you know, than to pay Yamen fines.Every night he turns up, grinning and bland.I tell him it won't do, and
out he goes, snorting like a dragon."Rudolph's impulse came to a head.Earle," he stammered, "I owe you a gratitude.You spoke to these
people so--as--I do not know.But I listened, I felt--Before always are
they devils, images!And after I hear you, they are as men."The other shook his great head like a silver mane, and laughed."My dear young man," he replied, "they're remarkably like you and me."After a pause, he added soberly:--

"Images?His deep voice altered, his eyes lighted shrewdly, as he turned
to Heywood."Quite," said the young man, readily."If you don't mind, padre, you
made Number One talk.In a few brief sentences, he pictured the death in the
shop.--So, like winking!The beggar gave himself the iron, fell down,
and made finish.Now what I pieced out, from his own bukhing, and the
merchant's, was this:--

"The dead man was one Au-yoeng, a cormorant-fisher.Some of his best
birds died, he had a long run of bad luck, and came near starving.So he
contrived, rather cleverly, to steal about a hundred catties of Fuh-kien
hemp.The owner, this merchant, went to the elders of Au-yoeng's
neighborhood, who found and restored the hemp, nearly all.But the neighbors kept after this cormorant fellow,
worked one beastly squeeze or another, ingenious baiting, devilish--Rot!Well, they pushed him
down-hill--poor devil, showing that's always possible, no bottom!He
brooded, and all that, till he thought the merchant and the Jesus
religion were the cause of all.So bang he goes down the
pole,--gloriously drunk,--marches into his enemy's shop, and uses that
knife.The joke is now on the merchant, eh?""Just a moment," begged the padre."One thread I don't follow--the
religion.Thought I told you," said Heywood."One of yours--big,
mild chap--Chok Chung.""Yes," the deep bass rumbled in the empty chapel, "he's one of us."Must be, sir," prompted the younger."The mob, meanwhile, just stood
there, dumb,--mutes and audience, you know.All at once, the hindmost
began squalling 'Foreign Dog,' 'Goat Man.'We stepped outside, and
there, passing, if you like, was that gentle bookworm, Mr.echoed the padre, as in doubt.Why, doctor," cried Heywood, "that long, pale chap,--lives over
toward the Dragon Spring.Confucian, very strict; keen reader; might be
a mandarin, but prefers the country gentleman sort; bally
mischief-maker, he's done more people in the eye than all the Yamen
hacks and all their false witnesses together!Hence his nickname--the
Sword-Pen."Earle sharpened his heavy brows, and studied the floor."Fang, the Sword-Pen," he growled; "yes, there will be trouble.Saul of Tarsus.--We're not the Roman
Church," he added, with his first trace of irritation.Once more he meditated; then heaved his big shoulders to let slip the
whole burden."One day at a time," he laughed."Thank you for telling us.--You see,
Mr.The only fault is, they're just human
beings.They talked of things indifferent; and when the young men were stumbling
along the streets, he called after them a resounding "Good-night!--and stood a resolute, gigantic silhouette, filling, as a right
Doone filled their doorframe, the entrance to his deserted chapel.At his gate, felt Rudolph, they had unloaded some weight of
responsibility.He had not only accepted it, but lightened them further,
girt them, by a word and a look.Somehow, for the first time since
landing, Rudolph perceived that through this difficult, troubled,
ignorant present, a man might burrow toward a future gleam.As for Heywood, he still marched on grimly, threading
the stuffed corridors like a man with a purpose."Catchee bymby, though.To lose sight of any man for twenty-four hours, nowadays,--Well,
it's not hardly fair.They turned down a black lane, carpeted with dry rubbish.At long
intervals, a lantern guttering above a door showed them a hand's-breadth
of the dirty path, a litter of broken withes and basket-weavers' refuse,
between the mouldy wall of the town and a row of huts, no less black and
silent.In this greasy rift the air lay thick, as though smeared into
a groove.Suddenly, among the hovels, they groped along a checkered surface of
brick-work.The flare of Heywood's match revealed a heavy wooden door,
which he hammered with his fist.After a time, a disgruntled voice
within snarled something in the vernacular.Wutzler, you old pirate, open up!"A bar clattered down, the door swung back, and there, raising a
glow-worm lantern of oiled paper, stood such a timorous little figure as
might have ventured out from a masquerade of gnomes.The wrinkled face
was Wutzler's, but his weazened body was lost in the glossy black folds
of a native jacket, and below the patched trousers, his bare ankles and
coolie-sandals of straw moved uneasily, as though trying to hide behind
each other."Kom in," said this hybrid, with a nervous cackle."I thought you are
thiefs.Following through a toy courtyard, among shadow hints of pigmy shrubs
and rockery, they found themselves cramped in a bare, clean cell,
lighted by a European lamp, but smelling of soy and Asiatics.Stiff
black-wood chairs lined the walls.A distorted landscape on rice-paper,
narrow scarlet panels inscribed with black cursive characters, pith
flowers from Amoy, made blots of brightness."It iss not moch, gentlemen," sighed Wutzler, cringing."But I am ver'
glad.""And we came all the way to see
you."Oh, allow me," mumbled their host, in a flutter."My--she--I will
speak, I go bring you."He shuffled away, into some further chamber."Eat it," he whispered, "whether you can or not!Pleases the old one, no
bounds.We're his only visitors--"

"Here iss not moch whiskey."Wutzler came shambling in, held a bottle
against the light, and squinted ruefully at the yellow dregs."I will
gif you a _kong_ full, but I haf not."They heard his angry whispers, and a small
commotion of the household,--brazen dishes clinking, squeals, titters,
and tiny bare feet skipping about,--all the flurry of a rabbit-hutch in
Wonderland.Once, near the threshold, a chubby face, very pale, with
round eyes of shining jet, peered cautious as a mouse, and popped out of
sight with a squeak.Wutzler, red with excitement, came and went like an
anxious waiter, bringing in the feast."Here iss not moch," he repeated sadly.But there were bits of pig-skin
stewed in oil; bean-cakes; steaming buns of wheat-flour, stuffed with
dice of fat pork and lumps of sugar; three-cornered rice puddings,
_no-me_ boiled in plantain-leaf wrappers; with the last of the whiskey,
in green cups.While the two men ate, the shriveled outcast beamed
timidly, hovering about them, fidgeting."Herr Hackh," he suddenly exclaimed, in a queer, strained voice, "you do
not know how dis yong man iss goot!He hass to me--_immer_--" He
choked, turned away, and began fussing with the pith flowers; but not
before Rudolph had seen a line glistening down the sun-dried cheeks.Cadging for chow, does one acquire merit?"retorted Heywood,
over his shoulder."You talk like a bonze, Wutz.""I'd rather
hear the sing-song box.""_Ach so_, I forget!"Still whimpering, Wutzler dragged something from a
corner, squatted, and jerked at a crank, with a noise of ratchets."She
blay not so moch now," he snuffled."Captain Kneepone he has gifen her,
when she iss all op inside for him.I haf rebaired, but she blay only
one song yet.A man does not know, Herr Hackh, what he may be.Once I
haf piano, and viola my own, yes, and now haf I diss small, laffing,
sick teufel!"He rose, and faced Heywood with a trembling, passionate
gesture."But diss yong man, he stand by der oldt fellow!"Behind him, with a whirring sound, a metallic voice assailed them in a
gabble of words, at first husky and broken, then clear, nasal, a voice
from neither Europe nor Asia, but America:--


"Then did I laff?Ooh, aha-ha ha ha,
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!I could not help but laffing,
Ooh, aha-ha..."


From a throat of tin, it mocked them insanely with squealing,
black-hearted guffaws.Heywood sat smoking, with the countenance of a
stoic; but when the laughter in the box was silent, he started abruptly."We're off, old chap," he announced.Just came to see you were
all up-standing.Don't let--er--anything carry
you off."At the gate, Wutzler held aloft his glow-worm lantern.he mumbled, "Der plagues--dey will forget me.All zo many shoots, _kugel_, der bullet,--'_gilt's mir, oder gilt es
dir?_' Men are dead in der Silk-Weafer Street.Dey haf hong up nets, and
dorns, to keep out der plague's-goblins off deir house.Listen, now, dey
beat gongs!--But we are white men.You--you tell me zo, to-night!"He
blubbered something incoherent, but as the gate slammed they heard the
name of God, in a broken benediction.They had groped out of the cleft, and into a main corridor, before
Heywood paused."Queer it
should get into me so.But I hate being laughed at by--anybody."A confused thunder of gongs, the clash of cymbals smothered in the
distance, maintained a throbbing uproar, pierced now and then by savage
yells, prolonged and melancholy.As the two wanderers listened,--

"Where's the comfort," said Heywood, gloomily, "of knowing somebody's
worse off?--No, I wasn't thinking of Wutzler, then.why,
over there, it's goblins they're scaring away.Think, behind their nets
and thorns, what wretches--women, too, and kids--may be crouched down,
quaking, sick with terror.Humph!--I don't mind saying"--for a moment
his hand lay on Rudolph's shoulder--"that I loathe giving this muck-hole
the satisfaction--I'd hate to go Out here, that's all."CHAPTER VI


THE PAGODA

He was spared that inconvenience.The untimely rain and cold, some
persons said, the few days of untimely heat following, had drowned or
dried, frozen or burnt out, the seeds of peril.But accounts varied,
reasons were plentiful.Soldiers had come down from the chow city,
two-score _li_ inland, and charging through the streets, hacking and
slashing the infested air, had driven the goblins over the walls, with a
great shout of victory.A priest had freighted a kite with all the evil,
then cut it adrift in the sky.A mob had dethroned the God of Sickness,
and banished his effigy in a paper junk, launched on the river at night,
in flame.A geomancer proclaimed that a bamboo grove behind the town
formed an angle most correct, germane, and pleasant to the Azure Dragon
and the White Tiger, whose occult currents, male and female, run
throughout Nature.For any or all of these reasons, the town was
delivered.The pestilence vanished, as though it had come but to grant
Monsieur Jolivet his silence, and to add a few score uncounted living
wretches to the dark, mighty, imponderable host of ancestors.The relief, after dragging days of uncertainty, came to Rudolph like a
sea-breeze to a stoker.To escape and survive,--the bare experience
seemed to him at first an act of merit, the deed of a veteran.The
interim had been packed with incongruity.There had been a dinner with
Kempner, solemn, full of patriotism and philosophy; a drunken dinner at
Teppich's; another, and a worse, at Nesbit's; and the banquet of a
native merchant, which began at four o'clock on melon-seeds, tea, black
yearling eggs, and a hot towel, and ended at three in the morning on
rice-brandy and betel served by unreal women with chalked faces and
vermilion-spotted lips, simpering and melancholy.By day, there was
work, or now and then a lesson with Dr.Earle's teacher, a little aged
Chinaman of intricate, refined, and plaintive courtesy.Under his
guidance Rudolph learned rapidly, taking to study as a prodigal might
take to drink.And with increasing knowledge came increasing
tranquillity; as when he found that the hideous cry, startling him at
every dawn, was the signal not for massacre, but buffalo-milk.Then, too, came the mild excitement of moving into his own house, the
Portuguese nunnery.Through its desolate, lime-coated spaces, his meagre
belongings were scattered all too easily; but the new servants, their
words and ways, not only kept his hands full, but gave strange food for
thought.The silent evenings, timed by the plash of a frog in a pool, a
cry from the river, or the sing-song of a "boy" improvising some endless
ballad below-stairs; drowsy noons above the little courtyard, bare and
peaceful as a jail; homesick moments at the window, when beyond the
stunted orangery, at sunset, the river was struck amazingly from bronze
to indigo, or at dawn flashed from pearl-gray to flowing brass;--all
these, and nights between sleep and waking, when fancy peopled the
echoing chambers with the visionary lives, now ended, of meek, brown
sisters from Goa or Macao, gave to Rudolph intimations, vague, profound,
and gravely happy, as of some former existence almost recaptured.Once
more he felt himself a householder in the Arabian tales.And yet, when his life was growing all but placid, across it shot some
tremor of disquieting knowledge.One evening, after a busy day among his piece-goods, he had walked
afield with Heywood, and back by an aimless circuit through the
twilight.His companion had been taciturn, of late; and they halted,
without speaking, where a wide pool gleamed toward a black, fantastic
belt of knotted willows and sharp-curving roofs.Through these broke the
shadow of a small pagoda, jagged as a war-club of shark's teeth.Vesper
cymbals clashed faintly in a temple, and from its open door the first
plummet of lamplight began to fathom the dark margin.A short bridge
curved high, like a camel's hump, over the glimmering half-circle of a
single arch.Close by, under a drooping foreground of branches, a stake
upheld an oblong placard of neat symbols, like a cartouche to explain
a painting."It is very beautiful," ventured Rudolph, twisting up his blond
moustache with satisfaction.I would say--picturesque, no?""Very," said Heywood, absently."And the placard, so finishing, so artistic--That says?"Heywood glanced carelessly at the
upright sentence.That's a notice:--

"'Girls May Not be Drowned in This Pond.'"Without reply, Rudolph followed,
gathering as he walked the force of this tremendous hint.Slow,
far-reaching, it poisoned the elegiac beauty of the scene, alienated the
night, and gave to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look,
sombre and implacable.He was still pondering this, when across their
winding foot-path, with a quick thud of hoofs, swept a pair of
equestrian silhouettes.It was half glimpse, half conjecture,--the tough
little ponies trotting stubbornly, a rider who leaned across laughing,
and a woman who gayly cried at him: "You really do understand me, don't
you?"The two jogging shadows melted in the bamboo tracery, like things
blown down the wind.But for years Rudolph had known the words, the
laugh, the beguiling cadence, and could have told what poise of the head
went with them, what dangerous glancing light.Suddenly, without reason,
he felt a gust of rage.The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining
memory of her power.He should be riding there, in the dusk of this
lonely and cruel land.Heywood had thrown after them a single gloomy stare, down the pointed
aisle of bamboos."Chantel--He bounds in the saddle, and he
bounds afoot!"Rudolph knew that he had hated Chantel at sight.He could not bring himself, next day, to join their party for tiffin at
the Flowery Pagoda.But in the midst of his brooding, Teppich and the
fat Sturgeon assailed the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blows and
shouts.They had brought chairs, to carry him off; and being in no mood
to fail, though panting and struggling, they packed him into a
palanquin with many bottles of the best wine known to Fliegelman and
Sons.By a short cut through the streets--where checkered sunshine,
through the lattice roof, gave a muddy, subdued light as in a roiled
aquarium--the revelers passed the inland wall.Here, in the shade,
grooms awaited them with ponies; and scrambling into saddle, they
trotted off through gaps in the bamboos, across a softly rolling
country.Tortuous foot-paths of vivid pink wound over brilliant green
terraces of young paddy.The pink crescents of new graves scarred the
hillsides, already scalloped and crinkled with shelving abodes of the
venerable dead.Great hats of farmers stooping in the fields, gleamed in
the sun like shields of brass.Over knolls and through hollows the
little cavalcade jogged steadily, till, mounting a gentle eminence, they
wound through a grove of camphor and Flame-of-the-Forest.Above the
branches rose the faded lilac shaft of an ancient pagoda, ruinously
adorned with young trees and wild shrubs clinging in the cornices.At the foot of this aged fantasy in stone, people were laughing.The
three riders broke cover in time to see Mrs.Forrester, flushed and
radiant, end some narrative with a droll pantomime.She stood laughing,
the life and centre of a delighted group."And Gilbert Forrester," she cried, turning archly on her husband,
"said that wasn't funny!"Gilly tugged his gray moustache, in high good-nature.Chantel, Nesbit,
and Kempner laughed uproariously, the padre and the dark-eyed Miss Drake
quietly, Heywood more quietly, while even stout, uneasy Mrs.Earle
smiled as in duty bound.A squad of Chinese boys, busy with
tiffin-baskets, found time to grin.To this lively actress in the white
gown they formed a sylvan audience under the gnarled boughs and
the pagoda.called the white-haired giant, indulgently, to the
dismounting trio.Hackh, you should have come spurring."Rudolph advanced, pale, but with a calmness of which, afterward, he was
justly proud.The heroine of the moment turned toward him quickly, with
a look more natural, more sincere, than she had ever given him."I've heard so much about
you!"Was there a club, from which he had stolen out while she wept,
ignominiously, in that girl's arms?And then of a sudden he perceived,
with a fatuous pleasure, how well she knew him, to know that he had
never spoken.His English, as he drew up a stool beside Miss Drake, was
wild and ragged; but he found her an astonishing refuge.For the first
time, he recalled that this quiet girl had been beautiful, the other
night; and though now by day that beauty was rather of line than of
color, he could not understand how it had been overlooked.Tiffin,
meanwhile, sped by like an orgy.He remembered asking so many questions,
about the mission hospital and her school for orphans, that the girl
began at last to answer with constraint, and with puzzled, sidelong
scrutiny.He remembered how even the tolerant Heywood shot a questioning
glance toward his wine-glass.He remembered telling a brilliant story,
and reciting "Old Captain Mau in Vegesack,"--rhymes long forgotten, now
fluent and spontaneous.Through it, as
through a haze, he saw a pair of wide blue eyes shining with startled
admiration.But the best came when the sun had lowered behind the grove, the company
grown more silent, and Mrs.Forrester, leaning beside the door of the
tower, turned the great pegs of a Chinese lute.The notes tinkled like a
mandolin, but with now and then an alien wail, a lament unknown to the
West."Sing for us," begged the dark-eyed girl; "a native song."The
other smiled, and bending forward as if to recollect, began in a low
voice, somewhat veiled, but musical and full of meaning."The Jasmine
Flower," first; then, "My Love is Gathering Dolichos"; and then she
sang the long Ballad of the Rice,--of the husband and wife planting side
by side, the springing of the green blades, the harvest by millions upon
millions of sheaves, the wealth of the State, more fragrant to ancestors
than offerings of spice:--


"...O Labor and Love and hallowed Land!Think you these things are but still to come?Think you they are but near at hand,
Only now and here?--Behold.In her plaintive interlude, the slant-eyed servants watched her, nodding
and muttering under the camphor trees."And here's a song of exile," she said.--Rudolph had never seen her face like this, bending intently
above the lute.It was as though in the music she found and disclosed
herself, without guile."...Blue was the sky,
And blue the rice-pool water lay
Holding the sky;
Blue was the robe she wore that day.Why
Must life bear all away,
Away, away,
Ah, my beloved, why?"A murmur of praise went round the group, as she put aside the
instrument."The sun's getting low," she said lightly, "and I _must_ see that view
from the top."Chantel was rising, but sat down again with a scowl, as
she turned to Rudolph.Inside, with echoing steps, they mounted in a squalid well, obscurely
lighted from the upper windows, toward which decaying stairs rose in a
dangerous spiral, without guard-rail.A misstep being no trifle, Rudolph
offered his hand for the mere safety; but she took it with a curious
little laugh.Once, at a halt, she stood very
close, with eyes shining large in the dusk.Her slight body trembled,
her head shook with stifled merriment, like a girl overcome by mischief."You and I here!--I never
dreamed you could be funny.It made me so proud of you, down there!"He muttered something vague; and--the stairs ending in ruin at the
fourth story--handed her carefully through the window to a small outer
balustrade.As they stood together at the rail, he knew not whether to
be angry, suspicious, or glad."I love this prospect," she began quietly."That's why I wanted you to
come."Beyond the camphors, a wide, strange landscape glowed in the full,
low-streaming light.The ocean lay a sapphire band in the east; in the
west, on a long ridge, undulated the gray battlements of a city, the
antique walls, warmed and glorified, breasting the flood of sunset.All
between lay vernal fields and hillocks, maidenhair sprays of bamboo, and
a wandering pattern of pink foot-paths.Slowly along one of these, a
bright-gowned merchant rode a white pony, his bells tinkling in the
stillness of sea and land.Everywhere, like other bells more tiny and
shrill, sounded the trilling of frogs.As the two on the pagoda stood listening,--

"It was before Rome," she declared thoughtfully."Before Egypt, and has
never changed.You and I are just--" She broke off, humming:--


"Only here and now?Behold
They were the same in years of old!"Her mood  the scene: the aged continuity of life oppressed him.Yet he chose rather to watch the straggling battlements, far off, than
to meet her eyes or see her hair gleaming in the sun.Through many
troubled days he had forgotten her, despised her, bound his heart in
triple brass against a future in her hateful neighborhood; and now,
beside her at this time-worn rail, he was in danger of being happy.Suddenly, with an impulse that must have been generous,
she rested her hand on his arm.At these close quarters, her tremulous voice and searching upward glance
meant that she alone understood all his troubles.He started, turned for
some rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window
behind them.His lean young
face was very droll and knowing."Thank you so much, Maurice," she answered, perhaps dryly."You're a
dear, to climb all those dreadful stairs."said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, "no
trouble."When the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor
shadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging
chafed legging."You blossomed, old boy," he whispered."Quite the star, after your
comedy turn.""What price sympathy on
a pagoda?"For that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he
had in China.CHAPTER VII


IPHIGENIA

"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe."Heywood, still with a
malicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his
fretful pony.Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously.They two had
fetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting
before the nunnery gate."A tiff's the last thing I'd want with you.The
lady, in confidence, is not worth--"

"I do not wish," declared Rudolph, trembling,--"I do not wish you to say
those things, so!"laughed the other, and his pony wheeled at the word."I'll give
you one month--no: you're such a good, thorough little chap, it will
take longer--two months, to change your mind.Only"--he looked down at
Rudolph with a comic, elderly air--"let me observe, our yellow people
have that rather neat proverb.A hen's head, dear chap,--not with a
battle-axe!No sorrows of Werther, now,
over such"--He laughed again."Don't scowl, I'll be good.You'll supply the word, in two months!"He let the pony have his way, and was off in a clatter.Lonely, fuming
with resentment, Rudolph stared after him.What could he know, this
airy, unfeeling meddler, so free with his advice and innuendo?Let him
go, then, let him canter away.He had seen quickly, guessed with a
diabolic shrewdness, yet would remain on the surface, always, of a
mystery so violent and so profound.The young man stalked into his
vacant nunnery in a rage, a dismal pomp of emotion: reason telling him
that a friend had spoken sense, imagination clothing him in the sceptred
pall of tragedy.Yet one of these unwelcome words had stuck: he was Werther, it was
true--a man who came too late.Another word was soon fulfilled; for the
hot weather came, sudden, tropical, ferocious.Without gradation, the
vernal days and languid noons were gone in a twinkling.The change came
like another act of a play.One morning--though the dawn stirred cool
and fragrant as all dawns before--the "boy" laid out Rudolph's white
tunic, slipped in the shining buttons, smeared pipe-clay on his heaviest
helmet; and Rudolph, looking from his window, saw that on the river, by
the same instinct, boatmen were stretching up their bamboo awnings.Breakfast was hardly ended, before river, and convex field, and huddling
red tiles of the town, lay under a blurred, quivering distortion.At night, against a glow of fiery umber, the western hills
broke sharp and thin as sheet-iron, while below them rose in flooding
mirage a bright strip of magical water.Thus, in these days, he rode for his exercise while the sun still lay
behind the ocean; and thus her lively, pointed face and wide blue eyes,
wondering or downcast or merry, were mingled in his thoughts with the
first rousing of the world, the beat of hoofs in cool silences, the wide
lights of creation over an aged, weary, alien empire.Their ponies
whinnying like old friends, they met, by chance or appointment, before
the power of sleep had lifted from eyes still new and strange against
the morning.Sometimes Chantel the handsome rode glowering beside them,
sometimes Gilly, erect and solid in the saddle, laid upon their talk all
the weight of his honest, tired commonplaces.But one morning she cantered up alone, laughing at her escape.His pony
bolted, and they raced along together as comrades happily join forces in
a headlong dream.Quivering bamboo swept behind them; the river, on
their other hand, met and passed in hurrying panorama.They had no time
for words, but only laughter.Words, indeed, had never yet advanced them
beyond that moment on the pagoda.And now, when their ponies fell into
a shambling trot, came the first impulse of speech.Her glowing face was now averted, her gesture was not for
him, but for the scene.The river, up which they had fled, now rested broad and quiet as a
shallow lake, burnished faintly, brooded over by a floating, increasing
light, not yet compounded into day.Tussocks, innumerable clods and
crumbs of vivid green, speckled all the nearer water.On some of these
storks meditated,--sage, pondering heads and urbane bodies perched high
on the frailest penciling of legs.In the whole expanse, no movement
came but when a distant bird, leaving his philosophic pose, plunged
downward after a fish.Beyond them rose a shapeless mound or isle, like
some half-organic monster grounded in his native ooze."Are you all excuses, like the
others?"I am not afraid of anything--now," retorted Rudolph, and with truth,
after the dash of their twilight encounter."Go see what's on that island," she answered.Twice
I've seen natives land there and hurry away.Nesbit was too lazy to
try; Dr.Maurice Heywood refused to
mire his horse for a whim.In a rare flush of pride, Rudolph wheeled his stubborn mount and bullied
him down the bank.A poor horseman, he would have outstripped Curtius to
the gulf.But no sooner had his dancing pony consented to make the first
rebellious, sidelong plunge, than he had small joy of his boast.Fore-legs sank floundering, were hoisted with a terrified wrench of the
shoulders, in the same moment that hind-legs went down as by suction.The pony squirmed, heaved, wrestled in a frenzy, and churning the red
water about his master's thighs, went deeper and fared worse.With a
clangor of wings, the storks rose, a streaming rout against the sky,
trailed their tilted legs, filed away in straggling flight, like figures
interlacing on a panel.At the height of his distress, Rudolph caught a
whirling glimpse of the woman above him, safe on firm earth, easy in her
saddle, and laughing.Quicksand, then, was a joke,--but he could not
pause for this added bewilderment.The pony, using a skill born of agony, had found somewhere a solid verge
and scrambled up, knee-deep, well out from the bank.With a splash,
Rudolph stood beside him among the tufts of salad green.As he patted
the trembling flanks, he heard a cry from the shore.She might laugh, but now he
would see this folly through.He tore off his coat, flung it across the
saddle, waded out alone through the tussocks, and shooting forward full
length in the turbid water, swam resolutely for the island.Sky and water brightened while he swam; and as he rose, wrapped in the
leaden weight of dripping clothes, the sun, before and above him,
touched wonderfully the quaggy bank and parched grasses.He lurched
ashore, his feet caked with enormous clods as of melting chocolate.A
filthy scramble left him smeared and disheveled on the summit.The mound lay vacant, a tangled patch, a fragment of
wilderness.Yet as he stood panting, there rose a puny, miserable sound.The distress, it might be, of some small
animal--a rabbit dying in a forgotten trap.Faint as illusion, a wail, a
thin-spun thread of sorrow, broke into lonely whimpering, and ceased.He
moved forward, doubtfully, and of a sudden, in the scrubby level of the
isle, stumbled on the rim of a shallow circular depression.At first, he could not believe the discovery; but next instant--as at
the temple pond, though now without need of placard or interpreter--he
understood.This bowl, a tiny crater among the weeds, showed like some
paltry valley of Ezekiel, a charnel place of Herod's innocents, the
battlefield of some babes' crusade.A chill struck him, not from the
water or the early mists.In stupor, he viewed that savage fact.Through the stillness of death sounded again the note of living
discontent.He was aware also of some stir, even before he spied, under
a withered clump, the saffron body of an infant girl, feebly squirming.By a loathsome irony, there lay beside her an earthen bowl of rice, as
an earnest or symbol of regret.Blind pity urged him into the atrocious hollow.Seeing no further than
the present rescue, he caught up the small unclean sufferer, who moaned
the louder as he carried her down the bank, and waded out through the
sludge.To hold the squalling mouth above water, and swim, was no simple
feat; yet at last he came floundering among the tussocks, wrapped the
naked body in his jacket, and with infinite pains tugged his terrified
pony along a tortuous bar to the land.Once in the river-path, he stood gloomily, and let Mrs.Forrester canter
up to join him.But what can you have
brought back?He turned on her a muddy, haggard face, without enthusiasm, and gently
unfolded the coat.The man and the woman looked down together, in
silence, at the child.He had some foolish hope that she would take it,
that his part was ended.Like an outlandish doll, with face contorted
and thick-lidded eyes shut tightly against the sunshine, the outcast
whimpered, too near the point of death for even the rebellion of
arms and legs.The woman in the saddle gave a short, incredulous cry.Her face, all gay
curiosity, had darkened in a shock of disgust.Such a nasty little--Why
did--What do you propose doing with it?"Rudolph shook his head, like a man caught in some stupid blunder."I never thought of that," he explained heavily.With a sombre, disappointed air, he obeyed; then looked up, as if in her
face he read strange matter."I can't bear," she added quickly, "to see any kind of suffering.Why
did--It's all my fault for sending you!We were having such a good ride
together, and now I've spoiled it all, with this.--Poor little filthy
object!"She turned her hands outward, with a helpless, dainty gesture.His thoughts, then, had wronged
her.Drenched and downhearted, holding this strange burden in his
jacket, he felt that he had foolishly meddled in things inevitable,
beyond repair.Yet some vague, insurgent instinct, which
would not down, told him that there had been a disappointment.Then suddenly he mounted, bundle and all, and turned his willing pony
homeward."Come," he said; and for the first time, unwittingly, had taken charge.Without waiting, he beckoned her to follow.They rode stirrup to stirrup, silent as in their escape at
dawn, and as close bodily, but in spirit traveling distant parallels.He
gave no thought to that, riding toward his experiment.Near the town, at
last, he reined aside to a cluster of buildings,--white walls and rosy
tiles under a great willow."You may save your steps," she declared, with sudden petulance."The
hospital's more out of funds than ever, and more crowded.Rudolph nodded back at her, with a queer smile, half reckless and half
confident."Then," he replied, dismounting, "I will replenish my nunnery."Squatting coolies sprang up and raced to hold his pony.Others, in the
shade of the wall, cackled when they saw a Son of the Red-Haired so
beplastered and sopping.A few pointed at his bundle, with grunts of
sudden interest; and a leper, bearing the visage as of a stone lion
defaced by time, cried something harshly.At his words, the whole band
of idlers began to chatter.An
uneasy light troubled the innocent blue eyes, which had not even a
glance for him."No, I shan't get down," she said angrily."It's just what might
be--Your little brat will bring no good to any of us."He flung away defiantly, strode through the gate, and calling aloud,
traversed an empty compound, already heated by the new-risen sun.A
cooler fringe of veranda, or shallow cloister, lined a second court.Two
figures met him,--the dark-eyed Miss Drake, all in white, and behind
her a shuffling, grinning native woman, who carried a basin, in which
permanganate of potash swam gleaming like diluted blood.With one droll look of amusement, the girl had
understood, and regained that grave yet happy, friendly composure which
had the virtue, he discovered, of being easily forgotten, to be met each
time like something new.The naked mite lay very still, the breath weakly fluttered.A somewhat
nauseous gift, the girl raised her arms and received it gently, without
haste,--the saffron body appearing yet more squalid against the
Palladian whiteness of her tunic, plain and cool as drapery in marble.And followed by the
black-trousered woman, she moved quickly away to offer battle with
death.A plain, usual fact, it seemed, involving no more surprise than
repugnance.Her face had hardly altered; and yet Rudolph, for the first
time in many days, had caught the fleeting brightness of compassion.Mere light of the eyes, a half-imagined glory, incongruous in the sharp
smell of antiseptics, it left him wondering in the cloister.He knew now
what had been missing by the river."I was naked, and"--how ran the
lines?He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had
never known since boyhood, never seen away from home.Across a court the padre hailed him,--a tall, ungainly patriarch under
an enormous mushroom helmet of solar pith,--and walking along beside,
listened shrewdly to his narrative.The
padre, nodding, frowning slightly, stood at ease, all angles and loose
joints, as if relaxed by the growing heat.The leper, without, harangued from his place apart, in a raucous voice
filled with the solitary pride of intellect."Well, men shall revile you," growled Dr."He says we steal
children, to puncture their eyes for magic medicine!"Then, heaving his wide shoulders,--

"Oh, well!"he said wearily, "thanks, anyhow.Come see us, when we're
not so busy?Good!--Look out these fellows don't fly at you."Tired and befouled, Rudolph passed through into the torrid glare.The
leper cut short his snarling oration.But without looking at him, the
young man took the bridle from the coolie.He had
seen a child, and two women.And yet it was with a pang he found that
Mrs.CHAPTER VIII


THE HOT NIGHT

Rudolph paced his long chamber like a wolf,--a wolf in summer, with too
thick a coat.In sweat of body and heat of mind, he crossed from window
to window, unable to halt.A faintly sour smell of parched things, oppressing the night without
breath or motion, was like an interminable presence, irritating,
poisonous.The punkah, too, flapped incessant, and only made the lamp
gutter.Broad leaves outside shone in mockery of snow; and like snow the
stifled river lay in the moonlight, where the wet muzzles of buffaloes
glistened, floating like knots on sunken logs, or the snouts of
crocodiles.Birds fluttered, sleepless and wretched.Coolies, flung
asleep on the burnt grass, might have been corpses, but for the sound of
their troubled breathing."If I could believe," he groaned, sitting with hands thrust through his
hair."If I believe in her--But I came too late."He sprang up from it, wiped the drops off
his forehead, and paced again.The collar
of his tunic strangled him.He stuffed his fingers underneath, and
wrenched; then as he came and went, catching sight in a mirror, was
shocked to see that, in Biblical fashion, he had rent his garments."This is bad," he thought, staring.He shouted, clapped his hands for a servant, and at last, snatching a
coat from his unruffled boy, hurried away through stillness and
moonlight to the detested club.On the stairs a song greeted him,--a
fragment with more breath than melody, in a raw bass:--


"Jolly boating weather,
And a hay harvest breeze!"The loft was like a cave heated by subterranean fires.Two long punkahs
flapped languidly in the darkness, with a whine of pulleys.Under a
swinging lamp, in a pool of light and heat, four men sat playing cards,
their tousled heads, bare arms, and cinglets torn open across the chest,
giving them the air of desperadoes."Jolly boating weather," wheezed the fat Sturgeon.He stood apart in
shadow, swaying on his feet."What would you give," he propounded
thickly, "for a hay harvest breeze?"He climbed, or rolled, upon the billiard-table, turned head toward
punkah, and suddenly lay still,--a gross white figure, collapsed and
sprawling."How much does he think a man can stand?"snapped Nesbit, his lean
Cockney face pulled in savage lines.He'll die
to-night, drinking.""Die yourself," mumbled the singer, "'m goin' sleep.A groan from the players, and the vicious flip of a card, acknowledged
the hit.Rudolph joined them, ungreeting and ungreeted.The game went on
grimly, with now and then the tinkle of ice, or the popping of soda
bottles.Sharp cords and flaccid folds in Wutzler's neck, Chantel's
brown cheeks, the point of Heywood's resolute chin, shone wet and
polished in the lamplight.All four men scowled pugnaciously, even the
pale Nesbit, who was winning.Bad temper filled the air, as palpable as
the heat and stink of the burning oil.Only Heywood maintained a febrile gayety, interrupting the game
perversely, stirring old Wutzler to incoherent speech.cried the outcast, with sudden enthusiasm."In your
paper _Tit-bit_, I read.How dey climb der walls op, yes, but Rome is
safed by a flook of geeze.Gracious me, der History iss great sopjeck!I lern moch.--But iss Rome yet a fortify town?"Chantel rapped out a Parisian oath."Do we play cards," he cried sourly, "or listen to the chatter of
senility?""No, Wutz, that town's no longer fortified," he answered slowly."Geese
live there, still, as in--many other places."Chantel examined his finger-tips as though for some defect; then,
snatching up the cards, shuffled and dealt with intense precision."I read alzo," stammered Wutzler, like a timid scholar encouraged to
lecture, "I read zo how your Englishman, Rawf Ralli, he spreadt der fine
clock for your Queen, and lern your Queen smoking, no?"He mopped his
lean throat with the back of his hand.Next instant he whirled on
Rudolph in fury.--"Is this a game, or Idiot's Joy?""I'm playing my best," explained Rudolph, sulkily."Then your best is the worst I ever saw!Chantel laughed, without merriment; Rudolph flung down his cards,
stalked to the window, and stood looking out, in lonely, impotent rage.A long time passed, marked by alarming snores from the billiard-table.The half-naked watchers played on, in ferocious silence.Chantel broke out as though the talk
had but paused a moment."Fools will always sit in, when they do not
know.They rush into the water, also, and play the hero!"Heywood had left his cards,
risen, and crossing the room, stood looking over Rudolph's shoulder into
the snowy moonlight.On the shoulder his hand rested, as by accident."It's the heat, old chap," he said wearily."Don't mind what we say
to-night."Rudolph made no sign, except to move from under his hand, so that, with
their quarrel between them, the two men stared out across the blanched
roofs and drooping trees, where long black shadows at last crept
toward the dawn.They make it for the rest of us, so easily!Do you know," his voice rose
and quickened, "do you know, the other end of town is in an uproar?We
murder children, it appears, for medicine!"Rudolph started, turned, but now sat quiet under Heywood's grasp.Chantel, in the lamplight, watched the punkahs with a hateful smile."The Gascons are not all dead," he murmured."They plunge us all into a
turmoil, for the sake of a woman."He made a sudden startling gesture,
like a man who has lost control."For the sake," he cried angrily, "of a
person we all know!She is nothing more--"

There was a light scuffle at the window.Chantel," began Heywood, with a sharp and dangerous courtesy, "we
are all unlike ourselves to-night.I am hardly the person to remind you,
but this club is hardly the place--"

"Oh, la la!"The other snapped his fingers, and reverting to his native
tongue, finished his sentence wildly.Heywood advanced in long strides deliberately, as if
gathering momentum for a collision.Before his blow could fall, he was
sent spinning.Rudolph, his cheeks on fire, darted past and dealt, full
force, a clumsy backhand sweep of the arm.Light and quick as a leopard,
Chantel was on foot, erect, and even while his chair crashed on the
floor, had whipped out a handkerchief.Heywood," he said, stanching his lips, in icy
composure.His eyes held an odd gleam of satisfaction.Sturgeon to
see your friend to-morrow morning.Not without dignity, he turned, stepped quickly to the stairs, saluted
gravely, and went down.panted Nesbit, wrestling with Rudolph.Heywood wrenched the captive loose, but only to shake him violently, and
thrust him into a chair."I've a great mind, myself, to
run after the bounder and kick him.But that sort of thing--you did
enough.Chantel took you on,
exactly as he wanted."Wutzler came slinking back from his
refuge in the shadows.With arms folded, he eyed them sternly.By Jove,
you must let me fight that beast.The idiot, nobody fights duels
any more.I've always--His cuffs are always dirty, too, on the inside!"Rudolph leaned back, like a man refreshed and comforted, but his laugh
was unsteady, and too boisterous."Pistol-bullets--they fly on the wings of
chance!My dear young gentleman," scoffed his friend, "there's not a
pair of matched pistols in the settlement.And if there were, Chantel
has the choice.He paused, in a silence that grew somewhat menacing.From a slit in the
wall the wheel of the punkah-thong whined insistently,--rise and fall,
rise and fall of peevish complaint, distressing as a brain-fever bird."Swords, of course," continued Heywood.Fencing,--oh, I hate the man, and the art's by-gone, if you like, but
he's a beautiful swordsman!Rudolph still lay back, but now with a singular calm."It's just as well," he declared quietly.Heywood loosed a great breath, a sigh of vast relief."So you're there, too, eh?If you're another expert--Bravo!We'll beat him at his own
game!Hoist with his own what-d'-ye-call-it!I'd give anything"--He
thumped the table, and pitched the cards broadcast, like an explosion of
confetti, in a little carnival of glee."You old Sly-boots!--But are you
sure?"I am not afraid," replied Rudolph, modestly.He trained his young
moustache upward with steady fingers, and sat very quiet, thinking long
thoughts."Now let him come, as the Lord Mayor said
of the hare.With an even chance--And what a load off
one's mind!"He moved away to the window, as though searching for air.Instead of
moonlight, without, there swam the blue mist of dawn."Not a word must ever reach old Gilly," he mused."If you think," retorted the clerk, stiffly, "I don't know the proper
course of be'aviour!The tall silhouette in the window made no reply, but stood grumbling
privately: "A club!Yes, where we drink out of jam-pots--dead cushions,
dead balls--no veranda--fellow that soils the inside of his cuffs first!We're a pack of beach-combers."He propped his elbows on the long sill, and leaned out, venting
fragments of disgust.Then of a sudden he turned, and beckoned eagerly.Gray vapors from river and paddy-field, lingering
like steam in a slow breeze, paled and dispersed in the growing light,
as the new day, worse than the old, came sullenly without breath or
respite.A few twilight shapes were pattering through the narrow
street--a squad of Yamen runners haling a prisoner."The Sword-Pen remains active," said Heywood, thoughtfully."That dingy
little procession, do you know, it's quite theatrical?Even Rudolph could spare a misgiving from his own difficulty while he
watched the prisoner.It was Chok Chung, the plump Christian merchant,
slowly trudging toward the darkest of human courts, to answer for the
death of the cormorant-fisher.Rudolph saw again
the lighted shop, the tumbled figure retching on the floor; and with
these came a memory of that cold and scornful face, thinking so cruelly
among the unthinking rabble.The Sword-Pen had written something in
the dark."I go find out"; and Wutzler was away, as keen as a village gossip."Trouble's comin'," Nesbit asserted glibly.He stretched his arms, with a weary howl."That's the
first yawn I've done to-night.I'm off--seek
my downy."Alone with the grunting sleeper, the two friends sat for a long time and
watched the flooding daylight."What," began Rudolph, suddenly, and his voice trembled, "what is your
true opinion?You are so kind, and I was just a fool.That other day, I
would not listen.Now tell me, so--as you were to die next.Can I truly be proud of--of her?"He leaned forward, white and eager, waiting for the truth like a dicer
for the final throw.Poor old Gilly Forrester slaves here to send her junketing in Japan,
Kashmir, Ceylon, Home.What Chantel said--well, between the two of us,
I'm afraid he's right.So precious few of us, and trouble ahead.The natives lashing themselves into a state of mind, or being lashed.The least spark--Rough work ahead, and here we are at swords' points.""And the joke is," Rudolph added quietly, "I do not know a sword's point
from a handle."Heywood turned, glowered, and twice failed to speak."Rudie--old boy," he stammered, "that man--Preposterous!Rudolph stared straight ahead, without hope, without illusions, facing
the haggard light of morning.A few weeks ago he might have wept; but
now his laugh, short and humorous, was worthy of his companion."I do not care, more," he answered."Luck, so called I it, when I
escaped the militar' service.Luck, to pass into the _Ersatz!_--I
do not care, now.CHAPTER IX


PASSAGE AT ARMS

"Boy."Forrester bym-by come, you talkee he, master no got, you
chin-chin he come-back."The long-coated boy scuffed away, across the chunam floor, and
disappeared in the darkness.Heywood submitted his head once more to the
nimble hands of his groom, who, with horse-clippers and a pair of
enormous iron shears, was trimming the stubborn chestnut locks still
closer.The afternoon glow, reflected from the burnt grass and white
walls of the compound, struck upward in the vault-spaces of the ground
floor, and lighted oddly the keen-eyed yellow mafoo and his serious
young master.Nesbit, pert as a jockey, sat on the table swinging his feet furiously."Sturgeon would take it all right, of course," he said, with airy
wisdom."Not the least," Heywood assented gloomily.If I were commissioned to tell 'em outright--'The youngster can't
fence'--why, we might save the day.But our man won't even listen to
that.Chantel will see, on the spot, directly they
face.No fear: he's worked up to the pitch of
killing.He'll lunge first, and be surprised afterward.--So regrettable!Such remorse!--Oh, I know _him!_"

The Cockney fidgeted for a time.His face--the face of a street-bred
urchin--slowly worked into lines of abnormal cunning.Now--my boy used to be learn-pidgin at Chantel's.Knows that
'ouse inside out--loafs there now, the beggar, with Chantel's cook.Why
not send him over--prowling, ye know--fingers the bric-a-brac, bloomin'
ass, and breaks a sword-blade.'Can secure, all
plopah,' Accident, ye know.Heywood chuckled, and bowed his head to the horse-clippers.This afternoon's rather late for
accidents.You make me feel like Pompey on his galley: 'This thou
shouldst have done, and not have spoken on't,'--Besides, those swords
belonged to Chantel's father.He began as a gentleman.--But you're a
good sort, Nesbit, to take the affair this fashion."Lost in smoke, the clerk grumbled that the gory affair was unmentionable
nonsense.Then suddenly the gray eyes lighted, became both shrewd and
distant; a malicious little smile stole about the corners of his mouth.And this
one--by Jove, it won't leave either of 'em a leg to stand on!--Here,
mafoo, makee finish!"He sprang up, clapped a helmet on the shorn head, and stalked out into
the sunlight.We must pick up our young
Hotspur."The clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road.In the
shade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan,
saluted them with a pale and stoic gravity.he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the
nunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the
red tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the
roof."I never left any place with less regret.The three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence."You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice.Some are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?""I hope neither of you will misunderstand me.I'm horribly
afraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd."I cannot bear to
have him laugh, also!Heywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough."If that's all, never you fear!'Once in a
while we can finish in style.'Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I
think we must have been brothers!Heywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and tried again to cough.This
time, however, there was no mistake--he was laughing.Rudolph shot at him one glance of startled unbelief, and then, tossing
his head, marched on without a word.The two at his side were no companions--not even presences.He
went alone, conscious only of the long flood of sunset, and the black
interlacing pattern of bamboos.The one friendly spirit had deserted,
laughing; yet even this last and worst of earthly puzzles did not
matter.It was true, what he had read; this, which they called death,
was a lonely thing.On a broken stone bench, Sturgeon, sober and dejected, with puffy
circles under his eyes, sat waiting.A long parcel, wrapped in green
baize, lay across his knees.At his
feet wandered a path, rankly matted with burnt weeds, and bordered with
green bottle-ends, the "dimples" choked with discs of mud.The place was
a deserted garden, where the ruins of a European house--burnt by natives
in some obscure madness, years ago--sprawled in desolation among wild
shrubs.A little way down the path stood Teppich and Chantel, each with
his back turned and his hands clasped, like a pair of sulky Napoleons,
one fat, one slender.The wooden pretense of their attitude set Rudolph,
for an instant, to laughing silently and bitterly.This final
scene,--what justice, that it should be a mean waste, the wreck of silly
pleasure-grounds, long forgotten, and now used only by grotesque
play-actors.He must die, in both action and setting, without dignity.It was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly
private.Except for the breach by which they had entered, the blotched
and spotted compound walls stood ruinous yet high, shutting out all but
a rising slant of sunlight, and from some outpost line of shops, near
by, the rattle of an abacus and the broken singsong of argument, now
harsh, now drowsy.Heywood had been speaking earnestly to Sturgeon:--

"A little practice--try the balance of the swords.Most certainly," croaked that battered convivialist.He rose, and waddled down the path.Rudolph saw Chantel turn, frowning,
then nod and smile.The nod was courteous, the smile full of satire."Right-oh," he puffed, tugging from the baize cover a shining pair of
bell-hilted swords.His puffy eyes turned furtively
toward Rudolph."May be bad form, Hackh, but--we all wish you luck, I
fancy."Then, in a burst of candor, "Wish that unspeakable ass felt as
seedy as I do--heat-stroke--drop dead--that sort of thing."Still grumbling treason, this strange second rejoined his principal."Jackets off," commanded Heywood; and in their cinglets, each with sword
under arm, the two friends took shelter behind a ragged clump of
plantains.The yellow leaves, half dead with drought and blight, hung
ponderous as torn strips of sheet metal in the lifeless air.Behind this tattered screen, Rudolph studied, for a moment, the lethal
object in his hand.It was very graceful,--the tapering, three-cornered
blade, with shallow grooves in which blood was soon to run, the silver
hilt where his enemy's father had set, in florid letters, the name of
"H.B.A. Chantel," and a date.How long ago, he thought, the steel
was forged for this day."Come, show me how to begin; so that I
can stand up to him."Slowly, easily, his long limbs transformed with a sudden
youthful grace, Heywood moved through the seven positions of On
Guard.Rudolph learned only that his own clumsy imitation was hopeless."Once more.--He can't see us."Again and again, more and more rapidly, they performed the motions of
this odd rehearsal.Suddenly Heywood stepped back, and lowering his
point, looked into his pupil's face, long and earnestly."For the last time," he said: "won't you let me tell him?Rudolph hung his head, like a stubborn child."Do you still think," he answered coldly, "that I would beg off?"With a hopeless gesture of impatience, Heywood stepped forward briskly.And as their blades clashed softly
together, a quick light danced in his eyes."Here's how our friend will
stick you!"His point cut a swift little circle, and sped home.By a
wild instinct, the novice beat it awkwardly aside.His friend laughed,
poised again, disengaged again, but in mid-career of this heartless
play, stumbled and came pitching forward.Rudolph darted back, swept his
arm blindly, and cried out; for with the full impetus of the mishap, a
shock had run from wrist to elbow.He dropped his sword, and in
stupefaction watched the red blood coursing down his forearm, and his
third finger twitching convulsively, beyond control.I say,
that's a bad one."With a stick and a handkerchief, he twisted on a
tourniquet, muttering condolence: "Pain much?Then, dodging out from the
plantain screen, and beckoning,--"All you chaps!Nesbit came running, but at sight of the bloody victim, pulled up short.he whispered, first with a stare, then a grin of mysterious
joy.Sturgeon gave a sympathetic whistle, and stolidly unwound bandages.At first the two Napoleons remained aloof, but at last, yielding to
indignant shouts, haughtily approached.Heywood wiped his sword-blade very carefully on a plantain leaf; then
stood erect, to address them with a kind of cool severity."I regret this more than anybody," he declared, pausing, and picking his
words."We were at practice, and my friend had the misfortune to be run
through the arm."Chantel flung out his hands, in a motion at once furious and impudent.What a farce!--Will you tell me, please, since your friend has
disabled himself"--

Heywood wheeled upon him, scornfully."You have no right to such an expression," he stated, with a coldness
which conveyed more rage than the other man's heat.It's I who have spoiled your--arrangement, and therefore I am
quite ready to take up my friend's quarrel.""I have no quarrel with you," replied Chantel, contemptuously."You saw
last night how he--"

"He was quicker than I, that's all.By every circumstance, I'm the
natural proxy.Besides"--the young man appealed to the company,
smiling--"besides, what a pity to postpone matters, and spoil the
occasion, when Doctor Chantel has gone to the trouble of a clean shirt."The doctor recoiled, flung up a trembling arm, and as quickly dropped
it.His handsome face burned darker, then faded with a mortal pallor,
and for one rigid moment, took on such a strange beauty as though it
were about to be translated into bronze.His brown fingers twitched,
became all nerves and sinews and white knuckles.Then, stepping
backward, he withdrew from the circle."Since we are all so--irregular.Rudolph gave a choking cry, and would have come forward; but Sturgeon
clung to the wounded arm, and bound on his bandage.he scolded, as though addressing a horse; then
growled in Heywood's ear, "Why did _you_ go lose your temper?"We can't let him walk over us, though."The young man held the
sword across his throat, and whispered, "Only angry up to here!"And indeed, through the anxious preliminary silence, he stood waiting as
cool and ready as a young centurion.His adversary, turning back the sleeves of the unfortunate white linen,
picked up the other sword, and practiced his fingering on the silver
hilt, while the blade answered as delicately as the bow to a violinist.At last he came forward, with thin lips and hard, thoughtful eyes, like
a man bent upon dispatch.Both men saluted formally, and sprang
on guard.From the first twitter of the blades, even Rudolph knew the outcome.Heywood, his face white and anxious in the failing light, fought at full
stretch, at the last wrench of skill.Chantel, for the moment, was
fencing; and though his attacks came ceaseless and quick as flame, he
was plainly prolonging them, discarding them, repeating, varying,
whether for black-hearted merriment, or the vanity of perfect form, or
love of his art.Graceful, safe, easy, as though performing the grand
salute, he teased and frolicked, his bright blade puzzling the sight,
scattering like quicksilver in the endless whirl and clash.Teppich was gaping foolishly, Sturgeon shaking his head, the Cockney,
with narrow body drawn together, watching, shivering, squatting on toes
and finger-tips, like a runner about to spring from a mark.Rudolph,
dizzy with pain and suspense, nursed his forearm mechanically.The
hurried, silver ring of the hilts dismayed him, the dust from the garden
path choked him like an acrid smoke.Suddenly Chantel, dropping low like a deflected arrow, swooped in with
fingers touching the ground.On "three feet," he had delivered the blow
so long withheld.But Heywood, by some
desperate sleight, had parried the certainty, and even tried a riposte.Still afoot and fighting, he complained testily above the sword-play:--

"Don't shout like that!Above the sword-play, too, came gradually a murmur of voices.Through
the dust, beyond the lunging figures, Rudolph was distantly aware of
crowded bodies, of yellow faces grinning or agape, in the breach of the
compound wall.Men of the neighboring hamlet had gathered, to watch the
foreign monsters play at this new, fantastic game.Shaven heads bobbed,
saffron arms pointed, voices, sharp and guttural, argued scornfully.The hilts rang, the blades grated faster.But now it was plain that
Heywood could do no more, by luck or inspiration.Fretted by his clumsy
yet strong and close defense, Chantel was forcing on the end.Instantly, all saw the weaker blade fly wide, the
stronger swerve, to dart in victorious,--and then saw Doctor Chantel
staggering backward, struck full in the face by something round and
heavy.Another struck a bottle-end, and burst into milk-white fragments, like a
bomb.A third, rebounding from Teppich's girdle, left him bent and
gasping.Strange yells broke out, as from a tribe of apes.The air was
thick with hurtling globes.Cocoanuts rained upon the company,
tempestuously, as though an invisible palm were shaken by a hurricane.Among them flew sticks, jagged lumps of sun-dried clay, thick scales
of plaster.cried Nesbit, "the bloomin' coolies!"First to recover, he
skipped about, fielding and hurling back cocoanuts.A small but raging phalanx crowded the gap in the wall, throwing
continually, howling, and exhorting one another to rush in.cried Heywood, and started, sword in hand.But it was Nesbit who, wrenching a pair of loose bottles from the path,
brandishing them aloft like clubs, and shouting the unseemly
battle-cries of a street-fighter, led the white men into this deadly
breach.At the first shock, the rioters broke and scattered, fled round
corners of the wall, crashed through bamboos, went leaping across
paddy-fields toward the river.The tumult--except for lonely howls in
the distance--ended as quickly as it had risen.The little band of
Europeans returned from the pursuit, drenched with sweat, panting, like
a squad of triumphant football players; but no one smiled."That explains it," grumbled Heywood.He pointed along the path to
where, far off, a tall, stooping
