He destroyed a bridge over a ravine some distance to the south of St
Charles, and placed above it an outpost with orders to prevent a
reconstruction of the bridge.But when the British troops appeared on
the morning of the 25th, this and other outlying pickets fell back
without making any resistance.They probably saw that they were so
outnumbered that resistance would be hopeless.On the approach of the
troops Brown at first assumed an attitude of confidence.A messenger
came from Wetherall, 'a respectable old habitant,' to tell the rebels
that if they dispersed quietly, they would not be molested.Brown
treated the message as a confession of weakness.'I at once supposed,'
he said, 'that, followed in the rear by our friends from above, they
were seeking a free passage to Sorel, and determined to send a message,
that _if they would lay down their arms, they should pass unmolested_.'This message does not seem to have reached its destination.And hardly
had the engagement opened when Brown quickly changed his tune.'To go
forward {87} was useless, as I could order nothing but a
retreat--without it the people commenced retiring.I tried to rally
the little squads, my only hope being in keeping together the
fowling-pieces we had collected, but finding, after a long trial, my
strength and authority insufficient, I considered my command gone,
turned my horse, and rode to... St Denis (seven or eight miles), where
... I arrived about nightfall.'The rebels, or at any rate
those of them who were armed, seem to have been outnumbered by the
soldiers, of whom there were between three and four hundred.But the
fighting was apparently brisk while it lasted.The British lost three
killed and eighteen wounded.The _Patriote_ losses are not known.The
local tradition is that forty-two were killed and many more wounded.We know that thirty were taken prisoners on the field.The defeat of the rebels at St Charles really terminated the rebellion
in the country about the Richelieu.When news of the defeat spread
over the countryside, the _Patriote_ forces immediately disbanded, and
their leaders sought safety in flight.Papineau and O'Callaghan, who
had been at St Hyacinthe, {88} succeeded in getting across the Vermont
border; but Wolfred Nelson was not so fortunate.After suffering great
privations he was captured by some loyalist militia not far from the
frontier, taken to Montreal, and there lodged in prison.For some reason which it is difficult to discern, Wetherall did not
march on from St Charles to effect a pacification of St Denis.On
December 1, however, Colonel Gore once more set out from Sorel, and
entered St Denis the same day.He
recovered the howitzer and five of the wounded men he had left behind.In spite of the absence of opposition, his men took advantage of the
occasion to wreak an unfair and un-British vengeance on the helpless
victors of yesterday.Goaded to fury by the sight of young Weir's
mangled body, they set fire to a large part of the village.Colonel
Gore afterwards repudiated the charge that he had ordered the burning
of the houses of the insurgents; but that defence does not absolve him
from blame.It is obvious, at any rate, that he did not take adequate
measures to prevent such excesses; nor was any punishment ever
administered to those who applied the torch.{89}

But the end of rebellion was not yet in sight.Two more encounters
remain to be described.The first of these occurred at a place known
as Moore's Corners, near the Vermont border.After the collapse at St
Charles a number of _Patriote_ refugees had gathered at the small town
of Swanton, a few miles south of Missisquoi Bay, on the American side
of the boundary-line.Among them were Dr Cyrile Cote and Edouard
Rodier, both members of the Lower Canada Assembly; Ludger Duvernay, a
member of the Assembly and editor of _La Minerve_; Dr Kimber, one of
the ringleaders in the rescue of Demaray and Davignon; and Robert Shore
Milnes Bouchette, the descendant of a French-Canadian family long
conspicuous for its loyalty and its services to the state.Bouchette's
grandfather had been instrumental in effecting the escape of Sir Guy
Carleton from Montreal in 1775, when that place was threatened by the
forces of Montgomery.The grandson's social tastes and affiliations
might have led one to expect that he would have been found in the ranks
of the loyalists; but the arbitrary policy of the Russell Resolutions
had driven him into the arms of the extreme _Patriotes_.Arrested for
disloyalty at the outbreak of {90} the rebellion, he had been admitted
to bail and had escaped.These men, under the belief that the
habitants would rise and join them, determined upon an armed invasion
of Canada.Possibly they believed also that Wolfred Nelson was still
holding out.Papineau, it was said, had reported that 'the victor of
St Denis' was entrenched with a considerable force at St Cesaire on the
Yamaska.They therefore collected arms and ammunition, sent emissaries
through the parishes to the north to rouse the _Patriotes_, and on
December 6, flying some colours which had been worked for them by the
enthusiastic ladies of Swanton, they crossed the Canadian border, about
two hundred strong.They had two field-pieces and a supply of muskets
and ammunition for those whom they expected to join the party on
Canadian soil.Hardly had the invaders crossed the border when they encountered at
Moore's Corners a body of the Missisquoi Volunteers, under the command
of Captain Kemp, who were acting as escort to a convoy of arms and
ammunition.Having received warning of the coming of the insurgents,
Kemp had sent out messengers through the countryside to rouse the
loyalist {91} population.To these as they arrived he served out the
muskets in his wagons.And when the rebels appeared, about eight
o'clock at night, he had a force at his disposal of at least three
hundred men, all well armed.There is reason for believing that Kemp might have succeeded in
ambushing the advancing force, had not some of his men, untrained
volunteers with muskets in their hands for the first time, opened fire
prematurely.The rebels returned the fire, and a fusillade continued
for ten or fifteen minutes.But the rebels, on perceiving that they
had met a superior force, retired in great haste, leaving behind them
one dead and two wounded.One of the wounded was Bouchette, who had
been in command of the advance-guard.The rebels abandoned also their
two field-pieces, about forty stand of arms, five kegs of gunpowder,
and six boxes of ball-cartridge, as well as two standards.Among the
loyalists there were no casualties whatever.Only three of the rebels
were taken prisoner besides the two wounded, a fact which Kemp
explained by several factors--the undisciplined state of the loyalists,
the darkness of the night, the vicinity of woods, and the proximity of
the boundary-line, {92} beyond which he did not allow the pursuit to
go.The 'battle' of Moore's Corners was in truth an excellent farce;
but there is no doubt that it prevented what might have been a more
serious encounter had the rebel column reached the neighbourhood of St
Johns, where many of the _Patriotes_ were in readiness to join them.A few days later, in a part of the province some distance removed from
the Richelieu river and the Vermont border, there occurred another
collision, perhaps the most formidable of the whole rebellion.This
was at the village of St Eustache, in the county of Two Mountains,
about eighteen miles north-west of Montreal.The county of Two
Mountains had long been known as a stronghold of the extreme
_Patriotes_.The local member, W. H. Scott, was a supporter of
Papineau, and had a large and enthusiastic following.He was not,
however, a leader in the troubles that ensued.The chief organizer of
revolt in St Eustache and the surrounding country was a mysterious
adventurer named Amury Girod, who arrived in St Eustache toward the end
of November with credentials, it would seem from Papineau, assigning to
him the task of superintending the _Patriote_ cause {93} in the north.He is variously described as having
been a Swiss, an Alsatian, and a native of Louisiana.According to his
own statement, he had been at one time a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry
in Mexico.He was well educated, could speak fluently several
languages, had a bold and plausible manner, and succeeded in imposing,
not only upon the _Patriote_ leaders, but upon the people of St
Eustache.He found a capable and dauntless supporter in Dr J. O.
Chenier, the young physician of the village.Chenier was one of the
few leaders of the revolt whose courage challenges admiration; and it
is fitting that to-day a monument, bearing the simple inscription
CHENIER, should stand in the Place Viger in Montreal, among the people
for whom, though misguidedly and recklessly, he laid down his life.To St Eustache, on Sunday, November 26, came the news of Wolfred
Nelson's victory at St Denis.On Monday and Tuesday bands of
_Patriotes_ went about the countryside, terrorizing and disarming the
loyalists and compelling the faint-hearted to join in the rising.On
Wednesday night the rebels gathered to the number of about four hundred
{94} in St Eustache, and got noisily drunk (_s'y enivrerent
bruyamment_).They then proceeded, under the command of Girod and
Chenier, to the Indian mission settlement at the Lake of Two Mountains.Here they broke into the government stores and possessed themselves of
some guns and ammunition.They next made themselves unwelcome to the
superior of the mission, the Abbe Dufresne, and, in spite of his
protestations, carried off from the mission-house a three-pounder gun.On their return to St Eustache they forcibly entered the convent which
had been lately completed, though it was not yet occupied, and camped
there.The loyalists who were forced to flee from the village carried the news
of these proceedings to Montreal; but Sir John Colborne was unwilling
to take any steps to subdue the _Patriotes_ of St Eustache until the
insurrection on the Richelieu had been thoroughly crushed.All he did
was to send a detachment of volunteers to guard the Bord a Plouffe
bridge at the northern end of the island of Montreal.On Sunday, December 3, word reached St Eustache of the defeat of the
insurgents at St Charles.This had a moderating influence on many of
the _Patriotes_.All week the Abbe {95} Paquin, parish priest of St
Eustache, had been urging the insurgents to go back quietly to their
homes.He begged Chenier to cease
his revolutionary conduct.Chenier, however, was immovable.He
refused to believe that the rebels at St Charles had been dispersed,
and announced his determination to die with arms in his hands rather
than surrender.'You might as well try to seize the moon with your
teeth,' he exclaimed, 'as to try to shake my resolve.'The events of the days that followed cannot be chronicled in detail.When the Abbe Paquin and his vicar Deseves sought to leave the parish,
Girod and Chenier virtually placed them under arrest.The abbe did not
mince matters with Chenier.'I accuse you before God and man,' he
said, 'of being the author of these misfortunes.'When some of the
habitants came to him complaining that they had been forced against
their will to join the rebels, he reminded them of the English proverb:
'You may lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink.'Unfortunately, the Abbe Paquin's good influence was counteracted by
that of the Abbe Chartier, the cure of the neighbouring village of St
{96} Benoit, a rare case of an ecclesiastic lending his support to the
rebel movement, in direct contravention of the orders of his superiors.On several occasions the Abbe Chartier came over to St Eustache and
delivered inflammatory addresses to the rebel levies.The vicar Deseves has left us a vivid picture of the life which the
rebels led.No attempt was made to drill them or to exercise
discipline.He continually saw them,
he says, passing through the village in knots of five or six, carrying
rusty guns out of order, smoking short black pipes, and wearing blue
_tuques_ which hung half-way down their backs, clothes of _etoffe du
pays_, and leather mittens.They helped themselves to all the strong
drink they could lay their hands on, and their gait showed the
influence of their potations.Their chief aim in life seemed to be to
steal, to drink, to eat, to dance, and to quarrel.With regard to the
morrow, they lived in a fool's paradise.They seem to have believed
that the troops would not dare to come out to meet them, and that when
their leaders should give the word they would advance on Montreal and
take it without difficulty.Their numbers during this period showed a
good deal of {97} fluctuation.Ultimately Girod succeeded in gathering
about him nearly a thousand men.Not all these, however, were armed;
according to Deseves a great many of them had no weapons but sticks and
stones.By December 13 Sir John Colborne was ready to move.He had provided
himself with a force strong enough to crush an enemy several times more
numerous than the insurgents led by Girod and Chenier.His column was
composed of the 1st Royals, the 32nd regiment, the 83rd regiment, the
Montreal Volunteer Rifles, Globensky and Leclerc's Volunteers, a strong
force of cavalry--in all, over two thousand men, supported by eight
pieces of field artillery and well supplied with provision and
ammunition transport.The troops bivouacked for the night at St Martin, and advanced on the
morning of the 14th.The main body crossed the Mille Isles river on
the ice about four miles to the east of St Eustache, and then moved
westward along the St Rose road.A detachment of Globensky's
Volunteers, however, followed the direct road to St Eustache, and came
out on the south side of the river opposite the village, in full view
of the rebels.Chenier, at the head of a hundred and fifty men,
crossed the {98} ice, and was on the point of coming to close quarters
with the volunteers when the main body of the loyalists appeared to the
east.Thereupon Chenier and his men beat a hasty retreat, and made
hurried preparations for defending the village.The church, the
convent, the presbytery, and the house of the member of the Assembly,
Scott, were all occupied and barricaded.It was about the church that
the fiercest fighting took place.The artillery was brought to bear on
the building; but the stout masonry resisted the battering of the
cannon balls, and is still standing, dinted and scarred.Some of the
Royals then got into the presbytery and set fire to it.Under cover of
the smoke the rest of the regiment then doubled up the street to the
church door.Gaining access through the sacristy, they lit a fire
behind the altar.'The firing from the church windows then ceased,'
wrote one of the officers afterwards, 'and the rebels began running out
from some low windows, apparently of a crypt or cellar.Our men formed
up on one side of the church, and the 32nd and 83rd on the other.Some
of the rebels ran out and fired at the troops, then threw down their
arms and begged for quarter.Our officers tried to save the {99}
Canadians, but the men shouted "Remember Jack Weir," and numbers of
these poor deluded fellows were shot down.'He had jumped from a window of the
Blessed Virgin's chapel and was making for the cemetery.How many fell
with him it is difficult to say.It was said that seventy rebels were
killed, and a number of charred bodies were found afterwards in the
ruins of the church.The casualties among the troops were slight, one
killed and nine wounded.One of the wounded was Major Gugy, who here
distinguished himself by his bravery and kind-heartedness, as he had
done in the St Charles expedition.A good
many, indeed, had fled from the village on the first appearance of the
troops.Among these were some who had played a conspicuous part in
fomenting trouble.The Abbe Chartier of St Benoit, instead of waiting
to administer the last rites to the dying, beat a feverish retreat and
eventually escaped to the United States.The Church placed on him its
interdict, and he never again set foot on Canadian soil.The behaviour
of the adventurer Girod, the 'general' of the rebel force, was
especially {100} reprehensible.When he had posted his men in the
church and the surrounding buildings, he mounted a horse and fled
toward St Benoit.At a tavern where he stopped to get a stiff draught
of spirits he announced that the rebels had been victorious and that he
was seeking reinforcements with which to crush the troops completely.Then, finding that the cordon was
tightening around him, he blew out his brains with a revolver.Thus
ended a life which was not without its share of romance and mystery.On the night of the 14th the troops encamped near the desolate village
of St Eustache, a large part of which had unfortunately been given over
to the flames during the engagement.In the morning the column set out
for St Benoit.Sir John Colborne had threatened that if a single shot
were fired from St Benoit the village would be given over to fire and
pillage.But when the troops arrived there they found awaiting them
about two hundred and fifty men bearing white flags.All the villagers
laid down their arms and made an unqualified submission.And it is a
matter for profound regret that, notwithstanding this, the greater part
of the village {101} was burned to the ground.Sir John Colborne has
been severely censured for this occurrence, and not without reason.Nothing is more certain, of course, than that he did not order it.It
seems to have been the work of the loyalist volunteers, who had without
doubt suffered much at the hands of the rebels.'The irregular troops
employed,' wrote one of the British officers, 'were not to be
controlled, and were in every case, I believe, the instrument of the
infliction.'Far too much burning and pillaging went on, indeed, in
the wake of the rebellion.'You know,' wrote an inhabitant of St
Benoit to a friend in Montreal, 'where the younger Arnoldi got his
supply of butter, or where another got the guitar he carried back with
him from the expedition about the neck.'And it is probable that the
British officers, and perhaps Sir John Colborne himself, winked at some
things which they could not officially recognize.At any rate, it is
impossible to acquit Colborne of all responsibility for the unsoldierly
conduct of the men under his command.It is usual to regard the rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada as no less
a fiasco than its counterpart in Upper Canada.There is no doubt that
it was hopeless from the outset.{102} It was an impromptu movement,
based upon a sudden resolution rather than on a well-reasoned plan of
action.Most of the leaders--Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown,
Robert Bouchette, and Amury Girod--were strangers to the men under
their command; and none of them, save Chenier, seemed disposed to fight
to the last ditch.The movement at its inception fell under the
official ban of the Church; and only two priests, the cures of St
Charles and St Benoit, showed it any encouragement.The actual
rebellion was confined to the county of Two Mountains and the valley of
the Richelieu.The districts of Quebec and Three Rivers were quiet as
the grave--with the exception, perhaps, of an occasional village like
Montmagny, where Etienne P. Tache, afterwards a colleague of Sir John
Macdonald and prime minister of Canada, was the centre of a local
agitation.Yet it is easy to see that the rebellion might have been
much more serious.But for the loyal attitude of the ecclesiastical
authorities, and the efforts of many clear-headed parish priests like
the Abbe Paquin of St Eustache, the revolutionary leaders might have
been able to consummate their plans, and Sir John Colborne, with the
small number of troops at {103} his disposal, might have found it
difficult to keep the flag flying.The rebellion was easily snuffed
out because the majority of the French-Canadian people, in obedience to
the voice of their Church, set their faces against it.{104}

CHAPTER X

THE LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER

The rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada profoundly affected public
opinion in the mother country.That the first year of the reign of the
young Queen Victoria should have been marred by an armed revolt in an
important British colony shocked the sensibilities of Englishmen and
forced the country and the government to realize that the grievances of
the Canadian Reformers were more serious than they had imagined.It
was clear that the old system of alternating concession and repression
had broken down and that the situation demanded radical action.The
Melbourne government suspended the constitution of Lower Canada for
three years, and appointed the Earl of Durham as Lord High
Commissioner, with very full powers, to go out to Canada to investigate
the grievances and to report on a remedy.John George Lambton, the first Earl of {105} Durham, was a wealthy and
powerful Whig nobleman, of decided Liberal, if not Radical, leanings.He had taken no small part in the framing of the Reform Bill of 1832,
and at one time he had been hailed by the English Radicals or Chartists
as their coming leader.It was therefore expected that he would be
decently sympathetic with the Reform movements in the Canadas.At the
same time, Melbourne and his ministers were only too glad to ship him
out of the country.There was no question of his great ability and
statesmanlike outlook.But his advanced Radical views were distasteful
to many of his former colleagues; and his arrogant manners, his lack of
tact, and his love of pomp and circumstance made him unpopular even in
his own party.The truth is that he was an excellent leader to work
under, but a bad colleague to work with.The Melbourne government had
first got rid of him by sending him to St Petersburg as ambassador
extraordinary; and then, on his return from St Petersburg, they got him
out of the way by sending him to Canada.He was at first loath to go,
mainly on the ground of ill health; but at the personal intercession of
the young queen he accepted the commission offered him.It was {106}
an evil day for himself, but a good day for Canada, when he did so.Durham arrived in Quebec, with an almost regal retinue, on May 28,
1838.Gosford, who had remained in Canada throughout the rebellion,
had gone home at the end of February; and the administration had been
taken over by Sir John Colborne, the commander-in-chief of the forces.As soon as the news of the suspension of the constitution reached Lower
Canada, Sir John Colborne appointed a provisional special council of
twenty-two members, half of them French and half of them English, to
administer the affairs of the province until Lord Durham should arrive.The first official act of Lord Durham in the colony swept this council
out of existence.'His Excellency believes,' the members of the
council were told, 'that it is as much the interest of you all, as for
the advantage of his own mission, that his administrative conduct
should be free from all suspicions of political influence or party
feeling; that it should rest on his own undivided responsibility, and
that when he quits the Province, he should leave none of its permanent
residents in any way committed by the acts which his Government may
have {107} found it necessary to perform, during the temporary
suspension of the Constitution.'In its place he appointed a small
council of five members, all but one from his own staff.The one
Canadian called to this council was Dominick Daly, the provincial
secretary, whom Colborne recommended as being unidentified with any
political party.The first great problem with which Lord Durham and his council had to
deal was the question of the political prisoners, numbers of whom were
still lying in the prisons of Montreal.Sir John Colborne had not
attempted to decide what should be done with them, preferring to shift
this responsibility upon Lord Durham.It would probably have been much
better to have settled the matter before Lord Durham set foot in the
colony, so that his mission might not have been handicapped at the
outset with so thorny a problem; but it is easy to follow Colborne's
reasoning.In the first place, he did not bring the prisoners to trial
because no Lower-Canadian jury at that time could have been induced to
convict them, a reasonable inference from the fact that the murder of
Weir had gone unavenged, even as the murderers of Chartrand were to be
acquitted {108} by a jury a few months later.In the second place,
Colborne had not the power to deal with the prisoners summarily.Moreover, most of the rebel leaders had not been captured.The only
three prisoners of much importance were Wolfred Nelson, Robert
Bouchette, and Bonaventure Viger.The rest of the _Patriote_ leaders
were scattered far and wide.Chenier and Girod lay beneath the
springing sod; Papineau, O'Callaghan, Storrow Brown, Robert Nelson,
Cote, and Rodier were across the American border; Morin had just come
out of his hiding-place in the Canadian backwoods; and LaFontaine,
after vainly endeavouring, on the outbreak of rebellion, to get Gosford
to call together the legislature of Lower Canada, had gone abroad.The
future course of the rebels who had fled to the United States was still
doubtful; there was a strong probability that they might create further
disturbances.And, while the situation was still unsettled, Colborne
thought it better to leave the fate of the prisoners to be decided by
Durham.Durham's instructions were to temper justice with mercy.His own
instincts were apparently in favour of a complete amnesty; but he
supposed it necessary to make an {109} example of some of the leaders.After earnest deliberation and consultation with his council, and
especially with his chief secretary, Charles Buller, the friend and
pupil of Thomas Carlyle, Durham determined to grant to the rebels a
general amnesty, with only twenty-four exceptions.Eight of the men
excepted were political prisoners who had been prominent in the revolt
and who had confessed their guilt and had thrown themselves on the
mercy of the Lord High Commissioner; the remaining sixteen were rebel
leaders who had fled from the country.Durham gave orders that the
eight prisoners should be transported to the Bermudas during the
queen's pleasure.The sixteen refugees were forbidden to return to
Canada under penalty of death without benefit of clergy.No one can fail to see that this course was dictated by the humanest
considerations.A criminal rebellion had terminated without the
shedding judicially of a drop of blood.Lord Durham even took care
that the eight prisoners should not be sent to a convict colony.The
only criticism directed against his course in Canada was on the ground
of its excessive lenity.Wolfred Nelson and Robert Bouchette had
certainly suffered a milder fate {110} than that of Samuel Lount and
Peter Matthews, who had been hanged in Upper Canada for rebellion.Yet
when the news of Durham's action reached England, it was immediately
attacked as arbitrary and unconstitutional.The assault was opened by
Lord Brougham, a bitter personal enemy of Lord Durham.In the House of
Lords Brougham contended that Durham had had no right to pass sentence
on the rebel prisoners and refugees when they had not been brought to
trial; and that he had no right to order them to be transported to, and
held in, Bermuda, where his authority did not run.In this attitude he
was supported by the Duke of Wellington, the leader of the Tory party.Wellington's name is one which is usually remembered with honour in the
history of the British Empire; but on this occasion he did not think it
beneath him to play fast and loose with the interests of Canada for the
sake of a paltry party advantage.It would have been easy for him to
recognize the humanity of Durham's policy, and to join with the
government in legislating away any technical illegalities that may have
existed in Durham's ordinance; but Wellington could not resist the
temptation to embarrass the Whig {111} administration, regardless of
the injury which he might be doing to the sorely tried people of Canada.The Melbourne administration, which had sent Durham to Canada, might
have been expected to stand behind him when he was attacked.Lord John
Russell, indeed, rose in the House of Commons and made a thoroughgoing
defence of Durham's policy as 'wise and statesmanlike.'But he alone
of the ministers gave Durham loyal support.In the House of Lords
Melbourne contented himself with a feeble defence of Durham and then
capitulated to the Opposition.Nothing would have been easier for him
than to introduce a bill making valid whatever may have been irregular
in Durham's ordinance; but instead of that he disallowed the ordinance,
and passed an Act of Indemnity for all those who had had a part in
carrying it out.Without waiting to hear Durham's defence, or to
consult with him as to the course which should be followed, the Cabinet
weakly surrendered to an attack of his personal enemies.Durham was
betrayed in the house of his friends.The news of the disallowance of the ordinance first reached Durham
through the columns of an American newspaper.{112} Immediately his
mind was made up.Without waiting for any official notification, he
sent in his resignation to the colonial secretary.He was quite
satisfied himself that he had not exceeded his powers.'Until I
learn,' he wrote, 'from some one better versed in the English language
that despotism means anything but such an aggregation of the supreme
executive and legislative authority in a single head, as was
deliberately made by Parliament in the Act which constituted my powers,
I shall not blush to hear that I have exercised a despotism; I shall
feel anxious only to know how well and wisely I have used, or rather
exhibited an intention of using, my great powers.'But he felt that if
he could expect no firm support from the Melbourne government, his
usefulness was gone, and resignation was the only course open to him.He wrote, however, that he intended to remain in Canada until he had
completed the inquiries he had instituted.In view of the 'lamentable
want of information' with regard to Canada which existed in the
Imperial parliament, he confessed that he 'would take shame to himself
if he left his inquiry incomplete.'A few days before Durham left Canada he took the unusual and, under
ordinary {113} circumstances, unconstitutional course of issuing a
proclamation, in which he explained the reasons for his resignation,
and in effect appealed from the action of the home government to
Canadian public opinion.It was this proclamation which drew down on
him from _The Times_ the nickname of 'Lord High Seditioner.'The
wisdom of the proclamation was afterwards, however, vigorously defended
by Charles Duller.The general unpopularity of the British government,
Duller explained, was such in Canada that a little more or less could
not affect it; whereas it was a matter of vital importance that the
angry and suspicious colonists should find one British statesman with
whom they could agree.The real justification of the proclamation lay
in the magical effect which it had upon the public temper.The news
that the ordinance had been disallowed, and that the whole question of
the political prisoners had been once more thrown into the melting-pot,
had greatly excited the public mind; and the proclamation fell like oil
upon the troubled waters.'No disorder, no increase of disaffection
ensued; on the contrary, all parties in the Province expressed a
revival of confidence.'Lord Durham left Quebec on November 1, {114} 1838.'It was a sad day
and a sad departure,' wrote Buller.The
spectators filled every window and every house-top, and, though every
hat was raised as we passed, a deep silence marked the general grief
for Lord Durham's departure.'Durham had been in Canada only five
short months.Yet in that time he had gained a knowledge of, and an
insight into, the Canadian situation such as no other governor of
Canada had possessed.The permanent monument of that insight is, of
course, his famous _Report on the Affairs of British North America_,
issued by the Colonial Office in 1839.This is no place to write at
length about that greatest of all documents ever published with regard
to colonial affairs.In the _Report_
Lord Durham rightly diagnosed the evils of the body politic in Canada.He traced the rebellion to two causes, in the main: first, racial
feeling; and, secondly, that 'union of representative and irresponsible
government' of which he said that it was difficult to understand how
any English statesman ever imagined that such a system would work.And
yet one of the two chief remedies which he recommended seemed like a
death sentence passed on the French in Canada.{115} This was the
proposal for the legislative union of Upper and Lower Canada with the
avowed object of anglicizing by absorption the French population.This
suggestion certainly did not promote racial peace.The other proposal,
that of granting to the Canadian people responsible government in all
matters not infringing'strictly imperial interests,' blazed the trail
leading out of the swamps of pre-rebellion politics.In one respect only is Lord Durham's _Report_ seriously faulty: it is
not fair to French Canadians.'They cling,' wrote Durham, 'to ancient
prejudices, ancient customs, and ancient laws, not from any strong
sense of their beneficial effects, but with the unreasoning tenacity of
an uneducated and unprogressive people.'To their racial and
nationalist ambitions he was far from favourable.'The error,' he
contended, 'to which the present contest is to be attributed is the
vain endeavour to preserve a French-Canadian nationality in the midst
of Anglo-American colonies and states'; and he quoted with seeming
approval the statement of one of the Lower Canada 'Bureaucrats' that
'Lower Canada must be _English_, at the expense, if necessary, of not
being _British_.'His primary {116} object in recommending the union
of the two Canadas, to place the French in a minority in the united
province, was surely a mistaken policy.Lord Elgin, a far wiser statesman, who completed Durham's
work by introducing the substance of responsible government which the
_Report_ recommended, decidedly opposed anything in the nature of a
gradual crusade against French-Canadian nationalism.'I for one,' he
wrote, 'am deeply convinced of the impolicy of all such attempts to
denationalize the French.Generally speaking, they produce the
opposite effect, causing the flame of national prejudice and animosity
to burn more fiercely.But suppose them to be successful, what would
be the result?You may perhaps _Americanize_, but, depend upon it, by
methods of this description you will never _Anglicize_ the French
inhabitants of the province.Let them feel, on the other hand, that
their religion, their habits, their prepossessions, their prejudices if
you will, are more considered and respected here than in other portions
of this vast continent, and who will venture to say that the last hand
which waves the British flag on American ground may not be that of a
French Canadian?'{117}

CHAPTER XI

THE SECOND REBELLION

The frigate _Inconstant_, with Lord Durham on board, was not two days
out from Quebec when rebellion broke out anew in Lower Canada.This
second rebellion, however, was not caused by Lord Durham's departure,
but was the result of a long course of agitation which had been carried
on along the American border throughout the months of Lord Durham's
regime.As early as February 1838 numbers of Canadian refugees had gathered in
the towns on the American side of the boundary-line in the
neighbourhood of Lake Champlain.They were shown much sympathy and
encouragement by the Americans, and seem to have laboured under the
delusion that the American government would come to their assistance.A proclamation signed by Robert Nelson, a brother of Wolfred Nelson,
declared the independence of Canada under a {118} 'provisional
government' of which Robert Nelson was president and Dr Cote a member.The identity of the other members is a mystery.Papineau seems to have
had some dealings with Nelson and Cote, and to have dallied with the
idea of throwing in his lot with them; but he soon broke off
negotiations.'Papineau,' wrote Robert Nelson, 'has abandoned us, and
this through selfish and family motives regarding the seigniories, and
inveterate love of the old French bad laws.'There is reason to
believe, however, that Papineau had been in communication with the
authorities at Washington, and that his desertion of Robert Nelson and
Cote was in reality due to his discovery that President Van Buren was
not ready to depart from his attitude of neutrality.On February 28, 1838, Robert Nelson and Cote had crossed the border
with an armed force of French-Canadian refugees and three small
field-pieces.Their plan had contemplated the capture of Montreal and
a junction with another invading force at Three Rivers.But on finding
their way barred by the Missisquoi militia, they had beat a hasty
retreat to the border, without fighting; and had there been disarmed by
the American {119} troops under General Wool, a brave and able officer
who had fought with conspicuous gallantry at the battle of Queenston
Heights in 1812.During the summer months, however, the refugees had continued to lay
plans for an insurrection in Lower Canada.Emissaries had been
constantly moving among the parishes north of the New York and Vermont
frontiers, promising the _Patriotes_ arms and supplies and men from the
United States.And when November
came large bodies of disaffected habitants gathered at St Ours, St
Charles, St Michel, L'Acadie, Chateauguay, and Beauharnois.They had
apparently been led to expect that they would be met at some of these
places by American sympathizers with arms and supplies.No such aid
being found at the rendezvous, many returned to their homes.But some
persevered in the movement, and made their way with packs on their
backs to Napierville, a town fifteen miles north of the boundary-line,
which had been designated as the rebel headquarters.Meanwhile, Robert Nelson had moved northward to Napierville from the
American side of the border with a small band of refugees.{120} Among
these were two French officers, named Hindenlang and Touvrey, who had
been inveigled into joining the expedition.Hindenlang, who afterwards
paid for his folly with his life, has left an interesting account of
what happened.He and Touvrey joined Nelson at St Albans, on the west
side of Lake Champlain.With two hundred and fifty muskets, which had
been placed in a boat by an American sympathizer, they dropped down the
river to the Canadian border.There were five in the party--Nelson and
the two French officers, the guide, and the boatman.Nelson had given
Hindenlang to understand that the habitants had risen and that he would
be greeted at the Canadian border by a large force of enthusiastic
recruits.'There was not a
single man to receive the famous President of the _Provisional
Government_; and it was only after a full hour's search, and much
trouble, [that] the guide returned with five or six men to land the
arms.'On the morning of November 4 the party arrived at Napierville.Here Hindenlang found Dr Cote already at the head of two or three
hundred men.A crowd speedily gathered, and Robert Nelson was
proclaimed 'President of the Republic of {121} Lower Canada.'Hindenlang and Touvrey were presented to the crowd; and to his great
astonishment Hindenlang was informed that his rank in the rebel force
was that of brigadier-general.The first two or three days were spent in hastening the arrival of
reinforcements and in gathering arms.By the 7th Nelson had collected
a force of about twenty-five hundred men, whom Hindenlang told off in
companies and divisions.Most of the rebels were armed with pitchforks
and pikes.An attempt had been made two days earlier, on a Sunday, to
obtain arms, ammunition, and stores from the houses of the Indians of
Caughnawaga while they were at church; but a squaw in search of her cow
had discovered the raiders and had given the alarm, with the result
that the Indians, seizing muskets and tomahawks, had repelled the
attack and taken seventy prisoners.On November 5 Nelson sent Cote with a force of four or five hundred men
south to Rouse's Point, on the boundary-line, to secure more arms and
ammunition from the American sympathizers.On his way south Cote
encountered a picket of a company of loyalist volunteers stationed at
Lacolle, and drove it {122} in.On his return journey, however, he met
with greater opposition.The company at Lacolle had been reinforced in
the meantime by several companies of loyalist militia from Hemmingford.As the rebels appeared the loyalist militia attacked them; and after a
brisk skirmish, which lasted from twenty to twenty-five minutes, drove
them from the field.Without further ado the rebels fled across the
border, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as
well as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used
in the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of
ball-cartridge, and a great many pikes.Of the provincial troops two
were killed and one was severely wounded.The defeat of Cote and his men at Lacolle meant that Nelson's line of
communications with his base on the American frontier was cut.At the
same time he received word that Sir John Colborne was advancing on
Napierville from Laprairie with a strong force of regulars and
volunteers.Under these circumstances he determined to fall back on
Odelltown, just north of the border.He had with him about a thousand
men, eight hundred of whom were armed with muskets.{123} He arrived
at Odelltown on the morning of November 9, to find it occupied by about
two hundred loyal militia, under the command of the inspecting
field-officer of the district, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor.He had no
difficulty in driving in the loyalist outposts; but the village itself
proved a harder nut to crack.Taylor had concentrated his little force
at the Methodist church, and he controlled the road leading to it by
means of the six-pounder which had been taken from the rebels three
days before at Lacolle.The insurgents extended through the fields to
the right and left, and opened a vigorous fire on the church from
behind some barns; but many of the men seem to have kept out of range.'The greater part of the Canadians kept out of shot,' wrote Hindenlang;
'threw themselves on their knees, with their faces buried in the snow,
praying to God, and remaining as motionless as if they were so many
saints, hewn in stone.Many remained in that posture as long as the
fighting lasted.'The truth appears to be that many of Nelson's men
had been intimidated into joining the rebel force.The engagement
lasted in all about two hours and a half.The defenders of the church
made several successful sallies; and just when the {124} rebels were
beginning to lose heart, a company of loyalists from across the
Richelieu fell on their flank and completed their discomfiture.The
rebels then retreated to Napierville, under the command of Hindenlang.Robert Nelson, seeing that the day was lost, left his men in the lurch
and rode for the American border.The losses of the rebels were
serious; they left fifty dead on the field and carried off as many
wounded.Of the loyalists, one officer and five men were killed and
one officer and eight men wounded.Later in the same day Sir John Colborne, at the head of a formidable
force, entered Napierville.On his approach those rebels who were
still in the village dispersed and fled to their homes.Detachments of
troops were immediately sent out to disperse bands of rebels reported
to be still under arms.The only encounter took place at Beauharnois,
where a large body of insurgents had assembled.After a slight
resistance they were driven out by two battalions of Glengarry
volunteers, supported by two companies of the 71st and a detachment of
Royal Engineers.In these expeditions the British soldiers, especially the volunteers,
did a good deal of burning and harrying.After the victory at {125}
Beauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village,
including the houses of some loyal citizens.In view of the
intimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected
by the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in
these regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused.But
no excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities.There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels'
burned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's
second-in-command.Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old
Firebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for
incendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear
that he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the
offenders.The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week.Failing important aid from the United States, the
rebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year
before, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had
been considerably increased in number.The chief responsibility for
the rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126}
the critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to
extricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which
he had led them.As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the
rebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the
hands of the authorities.Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred
were brought to trial.Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them
being Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the
prisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of
trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their
functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially
convened for the purpose.Twelve of them, including the French officer
Hindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed.Most of the
others were transported to the convict settlements of Australia.It is
worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been
persons of note in the political arena before 1837.On the whole, it
must be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation.It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord
Durham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some
{127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence.And
the execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in
the revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on
the part of the government.{128}

CHAPTER XII

A POSTSCRIPT

The rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past.The _Patriotes_
and the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present
generation has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which
inspired them.The time has come when Canadians should take an
impartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to
recognize the good and the bad on either side.It is absurd to pretend
that many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal
in their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their
methods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_
leaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and
during it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants
they had misled.On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be
proud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only
persons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the
French-Canadian Church.Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to
liberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like
Robert Bouchette.'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote
Bouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for
which some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an
organized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are
inherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be
denied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however
remote.'The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and
liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget
that in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of
Canada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they
have been made free.From a print in M'Gill University
Library.]The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this
little book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying
fortunes.Robert Nelson took
up his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his
death in 1873.E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there
employed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of
volumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents
relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes
which are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on
Canadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him
for his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37.Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual
amnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin
administration, and returned to Canada.Many of these, as well as many
of the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion
and who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and
prominence in the public service of Canada.Louis Hippolyte
LaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and
after having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the
parliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the
administration which ushered in full responsible government, and was
knighted by Queen Victoria.Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131}
of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in
hiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin
administration.George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at
St Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was
made a baronet by his sovereign.Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his
practice in Montreal in 1842.In 1844 he was elected member of
parliament for the county of Richelieu.In 1851 he was appointed an
inspector of prisons.Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal,
took up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by
Canadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a
halfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at
Moore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs
at Ottawa.Papineau returned to Canada in 1845.The greater part of his period of
exile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the'red
republicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848.He entered
the Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854.{132} But he
proved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things
under responsible government.Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine,
who had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach.The
truth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition.That he himself
realized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when
explaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an
opposition boat.'His real importance after his return to Canada lay
not in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave
to those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the
foundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti
Rouge_.In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the
_Patriote_ party of 1837.Papineau's later days were quiet and
dignified.He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at
Montebello and devoted himself to his books.With many of his old
antagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation.Only on rare
occasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came
to Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver
an address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which
may be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe
me, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country....  Opinions outside
may differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I
feel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.'And
charity covereth a multitude of sins.{134}

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of
the general histories of Canada.William Kingsford, _History of
Canada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias
against the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and
interesting.F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents
the history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with
sympathy and power.A work which holds the scales very evenly is
Robert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_
(1848-55).Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the
pre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of
original material of first-rate importance.Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of
mention.L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its
complete biographies of the leaders in the movement.L. N. Carrier,
_Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion
written by the son of one of the _Patriotes_.Globensky, _La Rebellion
de 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in
the loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value.Lord
Charles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada
under Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the
value of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the
introduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in
Canada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military
operations.The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point
of view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_
(1839).For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the
rebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North
America_.A few biographies may be consulted with advantage.N. E. Dionne,
_Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period;
as does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_
(_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol.See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada'
series; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of
Durham_ (1906).The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be
found to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the
rebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local
historical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county.An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state
trials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39;
exhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_
(1839).{136}

     By Oscar D. Skelton.Strachey gives a list of the names of twelve of
them, at the head of which is Winganuske.This list was no doubt written
down by the author in Virginia, and it is followed by a sentence,
quoted below, giving also the number of Powhatan's children.The
"great darling" in this list was Winganuske, a sister of Machumps,
who, according to Smith, murdered his comrade in the Bermudas.Strachey
writes:

"He [Powhatan] was reported by the said Kemps, as also by the Indian
Machumps, who was sometyme in England, and comes to and fro amongst us
as he dares, and as Powhatan gives him leave, for it is not otherwise
safe for him, no more than it was for one Amarice, who had his braynes
knockt out for selling but a baskett of corne, and lying in the English
fort two or three days without Powhatan's leave; I say they often
reported unto us that Powhatan had then lyving twenty sonnes and ten
daughters, besyde a young one by Winganuske, Machumps his sister, and a
great darling of the King's; and besides, younge Pocohunta, a daughter
of his, using sometyme to our fort in tymes past, nowe married to a
private Captaine, called Kocoum, some two years since."Does Strachey intend to say that
Pocahontas was married to an Iniaan named Kocoum?She might have been
during the time after Smith's departure in 1609, and her kidnapping
in 1613, when she was of marriageable age.We shall see hereafter that
Powhatan, in 1614, said he had sold another favorite daughter of his,
whom Sir Thomas Dale desired, and who was not twelve years of age, to
be wife to a great chief.The term "private Captain" might perhaps be
applied to an Indian chief.Smith, in his "General Historie," says
the Indians have "but few occasions to use any officers more than one
commander, which commonly they call Werowance, or Caucorouse, which is
Captaine."It is probably not possible, with the best intentions, to
twist Kocoum into Caucorouse, or to suppose that Strachey intended to
say that a private captain was called in Indian a Kocoum.Werowance
and Caucorouse are not synonymous terms.Werowance means "chief," and
Caucorouse means "talker" or "orator," and is the original of our word
"caucus."Either Strachey was uninformed, or Pocahontas was married to an
Indian--a not violent presumption considering her age and the fact
that war between Powhatan and the whites for some time had cut off
intercourse between them--or Strachey referred to her marriage with
Rolfe, whom he calls by mistake Kocoum.If this is to be accepted,
then this paragraph must have been written in England in 1616, and have
referred to the marriage to Rolfe it "some two years since," in 1614.That Pocahontas was a gentle-hearted and pleasing girl, and, through her
acquaintance with Smith, friendly to the whites, there is no doubt; that
she was not different in her habits and mode of life from other Indian
girls, before the time of her kidnapping, there is every reason to
suppose.It was the English who magnified the imperialism of her father,
and exaggerated her own station as Princess.She certainly put on no
airs of royalty when she was "cart-wheeling" about the fort.Nor
does this detract anything from the native dignity of the mature, and
converted, and partially civilized woman.We should expect there would be the discrepancies which have been
noticed in the estimates of her age.Powhatan is not said to have kept
a private secretary to register births in his family.If Pocahontas gave
her age correctly, as it appears upon her London portrait in 1616,
aged twenty-one, she must have been eighteen years of age when she was
captured in 1613 This would make her about twelve at the time of Smith's
captivity in 1607-8.There is certainly room for difference of opinion
as to whether so precocious a woman, as her intelligent apprehension of
affairs shows her to have been, should have remained unmarried till the
age of eighteen.In marrying at least as early as that she would have
followed the custom of her tribe.It is possible that her intercourse
with the whites had raised her above such an alliance as would be
offered her at the court of Werowocomoco.We are without any record of the life of Pocahontas for some years.The occasional mentions of her name in the "General Historie" are so
evidently interpolated at a late date, that they do not aid us.When
and where she took the name of Matoaka, which appears upon her London
portrait, we are not told, nor when she was called Amonata, as Strachey
says she was "at more ripe yeares."How she was occupied from the
departure of Smith to her abduction, we can only guess.To follow her
authentic history we must take up the account of Captain Argall and of
Ralph Hamor, Jr., secretary of the colony under Governor Dale.Captain Argall, who seems to have been as bold as he was unscrupulous
in the execution of any plan intrusted to him, arrived in Virginia
in September, 1612, and early in the spring of 1613 he was sent on an
expedition up the Patowomek to trade for corn and to effect a capture
that would bring Powhatan to terms.The Emperor, from being a friend,
had become the most implacable enemy of the English.Captain Argall
says: "I was told by certain Indians, my friends, that the great
Powhatan's daughter Pokahuntis was with the great King Potowomek,
whither I presently repaired, resolved to possess myself of her by any
stratagem that I could use, for the ransoming of so many Englishmen as
were prisoners with Powhatan, as also to get such armes and tooles as
he and other Indians had got by murther and stealing some others of our
nation, with some quantity of corn for the colonies relief."By the aid of Japazeus, King of Pasptancy, an old acquaintance and
friend of Argall's, and the connivance of the King of Potowomek,
Pocahontas was enticed on board Argall's ship and secured.Word was sent
to Powhatan of the capture and the terms on which his daughter would be
released; namely, the return of the white men he held in slavery, the
tools and arms he had gotten and stolen, and a great quantity of corn.Powhatan, "much grieved," replied that if Argall would use his daughter
well, and bring the ship into his river and release her, he would accede
to all his demands.Therefore, on the 13th of April, Argall repaired to
Governor Gates at Jamestown, and delivered his prisoner, and a few days
after the King sent home some of the white captives, three pieces, one
broad-axe, a long whip-saw, and a canoe of corn.Pocahontas, however,
was kept at Jamestown.Why Pocahontas had left Werowocomoco and gone to stay with Patowomek
we can only conjecture.It is possible that Powhatan suspected her
friendliness to the whites, and was weary of her importunity, and it may
be that she wanted to escape the sight of continual fighting, ambushes,
and murders.More likely she was only making a common friendly visit,
though Hamor says she went to trade at an Indian fair.The story of her capture is enlarged and more minutely related by Ralph
Hamor, Jr., who was one of the colony shipwrecked on the Bermudas in
1609, and returned to England in 1614, where he published (London, 1615)
"A True Discourse of Virginia, and the Success of the Affairs there
till the 18th of June, 1614."Hamor was the son of a merchant tailor in
London who was a member of the Virginia company.Hamor writes:

"It chanced Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahuntas
(whose fame has even been spread in England by the title of Nonparella
of Firginia) in her princely progresse if I may so terme it, tooke some
pleasure (in the absence of Captaine Argall) to be among her friends at
Pataomecke (as it seemeth by the relation I had), implored thither as
shopkeeper to a Fare, to exchange some of her father's commodities for
theirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned upon
occasion either of promise or profit, Captaine Argall to arrive there,
whom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiaritie with the English,
and delighting to see them as unknown, fearefull perhaps to be
surprised, would gladly visit as she did, of whom no sooner had Captaine
Argall intelligence, but he delt with an old friend Iapazeus, how and
by what meanes he might procure her caption, assuring him that now or
never, was the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeede that love
which he had made profession of, that in ransome of hir he might redeeme
some of our English men and armes, now in the possession of her father,
promising to use her withall faire and gentle entreaty; Iapazeus well
assured that his brother, as he promised, would use her courteously,
promised his best endeavors and service to accomplish his desire, and
thus wrought it, making his wife an instrument (which sex have ever been
most powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his plot which hee
had thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife and Pocahuntas, would
accompanie his brother to the water side, whither come, his wife should
faine a great and longing desire to goe aboorde, and see the shippe,
which being there three or four times before she had never seene, and
should be earnest with her husband to permit her--he seemed angry with
her, making as he pretended so unnecessary request, especially being
without the company of women, which denial she taking unkindly,
must faine to weepe (as who knows not that women can command teares)
whereupon her husband seeming to pitty those counterfeit teares, gave
her leave to goe aboord, so that it would pleese Pocahuntas to accompany
her; now was the greatest labour to win her, guilty perhaps of her
father's wrongs, though not knowne as she supposed, to goe with her, yet
by her earnest persuasions, she assented: so forthwith aboord they went,
the best cheere that could be made was seasonably provided, to supper
they went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to
expres their joy would ere be treading upon Captaine Argall's foot, as
who should say tis don, she is your own.Supper ended Pocahuntas was
lodged in the gunner's roome, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have
some conference with their brother, which was onely to acquaint him by
what stratagem they had betraied his prisoner as I have already
related: after which discourse to sleepe they went, Pocahuntas nothing
mistrusting this policy, who nevertheless being most possessed with
feere, and desire of returne, was first up, and hastened Iapazeus to be
gon.Argall having secretly well rewarded him, with a small Copper
kittle, and some other les valuable toies so highly by him esteemed,
that doubtlesse he would have betraied his own father for them,
permitted both him and his wife to returne, but told him that for divers
considerations, as for that his father had then eigh [8] of our Englishe
men, many swords, peeces, and other tooles, which he hid at severall
times by trecherous murdering our men, taken from them which though
of no use to him, he would not redeliver, he would reserve Pocahuntas,
whereat she began to be exceeding pensive, and discontented, yet
ignorant of the dealing of Japazeus who in outward appearance was no les
discontented that he should be the meanes of her captivity, much adoe
there was to pursuade her to be patient, which with extraordinary
curteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so to
Jamestowne she was brought."Smith, who condenses this account in his "General Historie," expresses
his contempt of this Indian treachery by saying: "The old Jew and his
wife began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahuntas."It will be noted
that the account of the visit (apparently alone) of Pocahontas and her
capture is strong evidence that she was not at this time married to
"Kocoum" or anybody else.Word was despatched to Powhatan of his daughter's duress, with a
demand made for the restitution of goods; but although this savage is
represented as dearly loving Pocahontas, his "delight and darling," it
was, according to Hamor, three months before they heard anything from
him.His anxiety about his daughter could not have been intense.He
retained a part of his plunder, and a message was sent to him that
Pocahontas would be kept till he restored all the arms.This answer pleased Powhatan so little that they heard nothing from him
till the following March.Then Sir Thomas Dale and Captain Argall, with
several vessels and one hundred and fifty men, went up to Powhatan's
chief seat, taking his daughter with them, offering the Indians a chance
to fight for her or to take her in peace on surrender of the stolen
goods.The Indians received this with bravado and flights of arrows,
reminding them of the fate of Captain Ratcliffe.The whites landed,
killed some Indians, burnt forty houses, pillaged the village, and went
on up the river and came to anchor in front of Matchcot, the Emperor's
chief town.Here were assembled four hundred armed men, with bows and
arrows, who dared them to come ashore.Ashore they went, and a palaver
was held.The Indians wanted a day to consult their King, after which
they would fight, if nothing but blood would satisfy the whites.Two of Powhatan's sons who were present expressed a desire to see their
sister, who had been taken on shore.When they had sight of her, and
saw how well she was cared for, they greatly rejoiced and promised to
persuade their father to redeem her and conclude a lasting peace.The
two brothers were taken on board ship, and Master John Rolfe and Master
Sparkes were sent to negotiate with the King.Powhatan did not show
himself, but his brother Apachamo, his successor, promised to use his
best efforts to bring about a peace, and the expedition returned to
Jamestown."Long before this time," Hamor relates, "a gentleman of approved
behaviour and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe, had been in love with
Pocahuntas and she with him, which thing at the instant that we were
in parlee with them, myselfe made known to Sir Thomas Dale, by a letter
from him [Rolfe] whereby he entreated his advice and furtherance to his
love, if so it seemed fit to him for the good of the Plantation, and
Pocahuntas herself acquainted her brethren therewith."Governor Dale
approved this, and consequently was willing to retire without other
conditions."The bruite of this pretended marriage [Hamor continues]
came soon to Powhatan's knowledge, a thing acceptable to him, as
appeared by his sudden consent thereunto, who some ten daies after sent
an old uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his deputy in the
church, and two of his sonnes to see the mariage solemnized which was
accordingly done about the fifth of April [1614], and ever since we have
had friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but
also with his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the
collonie should not thrive a pace."This marriage was justly celebrated as the means and beginning of a firm
peace which long continued, so that Pocahontas was again entitled to the
grateful remembrance of the Virginia settlers.Already, in 1612, a plan
had been mooted in Virginia of marrying the English with the natives,
and of obtaining the recognition of Powhatan and those allied to him as
members of a fifth kingdom, with certain privileges.Cunega, the Spanish
ambassador at London, on September 22, 1612, writes: "Although some
suppose the plantation to decrease, he is credibly informed that there
is a determination to marry some of the people that go over to Virginia;
forty or fifty are already so married, and English women intermingle and
are received kindly by the natives.A zealous minister hath been wounded
for reprehending it."John Rolfe was a man of industry, and apparently devoted to the
welfare of the colony.He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,
who gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at
the time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives
him the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,
the planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to
his power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England
by his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan's
daughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed
generation, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and
least any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him
hereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my
treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas
Dale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to
a theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,
instead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the
flutterings of a too susceptible widower's heart are hidden under a
great resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved
entirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:

"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make
between God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the
dreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men's hearts shall be
opened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be
not to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking
of so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man's weakness may
permit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good
of this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of
God, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge
of God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so
entangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even
awearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on
this subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind
and his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God's
displeasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange
wives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good
circumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should
thus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,
her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in
all nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,
I have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are
wicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man's
distruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such
diabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and
consequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,
whether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious
reason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:

"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde
another, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest
and strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,
in a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions
and sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe
indured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,
and carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a
good Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not
indeavor to make her a Christian?And these have happened to my greater
wonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which
in common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede
forgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the
remedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:

"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I
was created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but
to labour in the Lord's vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and
increase the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the
gospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be
reaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation
in the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance
of love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge
of God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness
to receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her
owne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of
so untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right
way?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or
uncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn't to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed
up his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands
of people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the
sacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,
and the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive
he vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men's
actions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt
mee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to
gorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually
inclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared
conscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less
fearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate
an estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope
but one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in
birth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con'tent.... But shall it
please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill
my ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe
appointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have
accomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will
daily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to
Amonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir
Thomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a
reverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas
was carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on
shore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best
sort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not
value her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would
still dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan's daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully
instructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good
progress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly
confessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is
since married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his
letter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may
perceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father
and friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in
the church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will
increase in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She
will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one
soule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date
with the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness
of which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale
it says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the
daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English
Gentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her
countrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was
baptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground
her in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,
then Rolfe's tender conscience must have given him another twist for
wedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had
ceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure
work of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It
is not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her
detention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate
of the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,
both of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious
subjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,
for it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to
London.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may
suppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to
convert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever
may have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor
Dale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED

Sir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet
Governor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the
change in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had
been held in common by the company, and there had been no division of
property or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime
land was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began
at once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the
colonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort
to fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter's to spread vital
piety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,
against "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The
Two Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers
the charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,
abandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable
labour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first
settling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these
aspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were
jails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision
all brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a
private he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States
General in 1611 granted him three years' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and
frugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a
soldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some
injurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,
he pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for
settling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,
the Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the
three hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,
that not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and
crazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards
with credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in
1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and
died in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and
his second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him
and received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to
Christianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired
him with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose
exquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,
with the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to
the court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with
him, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas
being already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight
and darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer
pledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan
himself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,
expressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented
to him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him
leave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also
inquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James's
land to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way
to his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of
him was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called
his Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside
guarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first
drank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then
returned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale
fared, "and after that of his daughter's welfare, her marriage, his
unknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor
replied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well
content that she would not change her life to return and live with him,
whereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and
Mr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without
the presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,
who already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may
never sequester themselves, and Mr.First there
was a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents
of coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of
a grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then
proceeded:

"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being
famous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your
brother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,
to intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to
permit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which
himselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of
whom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your
brother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife
and bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which
I entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me
answer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly
united together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in
the bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally
because himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as
he liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee
may, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe
thereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED
  LONDON AND BECCLES.TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:


  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.All of which has reference chiefly to the
indispensableness of preventing by every possible means the destruction
of the birds whose food largely consists of insects.But many of our so-called birds of prey, which have been thought to
be the enemies of the agriculturist and have hence been ruthlessly
destroyed, are equally beneficial.Fisher, an authority on the
subject, in referring to the injustice which has been done to many of
the best friends of the farm and garden, says:

"The birds of prey, the majority of which labor night and day to
destroy the enemies of the husbandman, are persecuted unceasingly.This
has especially been the case with the Hawk family, only three of the
common inland species being harmful.These are the Goshawk, Cooper's
Hawk, and the Sharp-shinned Hawk, the first of which is rare in the
United States, except in winter.Cooper's Hawk, or the Chicken Hawk,
is the most destructive, especially to Doves.The other Hawks are of
great value, one of which, the Marsh Hawk, being regarded as perhaps
more useful than any other.It can be easily distinguished by its
white rump and its habit of beating low over the meadows.Meadow Mice,
Rabbits, and Squirrels are its favorite food.The Red-tailed Hawk, or
Hen Hawk, is another."It does not deserve the name, for according to
Dr.Fisher, while fully sixty-six per cent of its food consists of
injurious mammals, not more than seven per cent consists of poultry,
and that it is probable that a large proportion of the poultry and game
captured by it and the other Buzzard Hawks is made up of old, diseased,
or otherwise disabled fowls, so preventing their interbreeding with the
sound stock and hindering the spread of fatal epidemics.It eats Ground
Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice, and Rats.The Red-shouldered Hawk, whose picture we present to our readers, is
as useful as it is beautiful, in fact ninety per cent of its food is
composed of injurious mammals and insects.The Sparrow Hawk (See BIRDS, vol.107) is another useful member
of this family.In the warm months Grasshoppers, Crickets, and other
insects compose its food, and Mice during the rest of the year.Swainson's Hawk is said to be the great Grasshopper destroyer of the
west, and it is estimated that in a month three hundred of these birds
save sixty tons of produce that the Grasshopper would destroy.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.On account of the value of its skin, this interesting animal is much
sought after by those who take pride in their skill in securing it.It is commonly known by its abbreviated name of <DW53>, and as it is of
frequent occurrence throughout the United States, every country boy is
more or less acquainted with its habits.As an article of food there is
much diversity of opinion respecting its merits.It is hunted by some
for the sport alone, which is doubtless to be lamented, and by others
who enjoy also the pleasure of a palatable stew.As a pet it is also
much prized.The food of the Raccoon consists in the main of small animals and
insects.The succulent Oyster also is a favorite article of its diet.It bites off the hinge of the Oyster and scrapes out the animal in
fragments with its paws.Like the Squirrel when eating a nut, the
Raccoon usually holds its food between its fore paws pressed together
and sits upon its hind quarters when it eats.Poultry is also enjoyed
by it, and it is said to be as destructive in the farm yard as the Fox,
as it only devours the heads of the fowl.When taken young the <DW53> is easily tamed, but often becomes blind soon
after its capture.This is believed to be produced by the sensitiveness
of its eyes, which are intended only to be used by night.As it is
frequently awakened by day it suffers so much from the glare of light
that its eyes gradually lose their vision.If it must be confined
at all it should be in a darkened place.In zoological gardens we
have frequently seen several of these animals exposed to the glaring
sunlight, the result of ignorance or cruelty, or both.Unlike the Fox, the Raccoon is at home in a tree, which is the usual
refuge when danger is near, and not being very swift of foot, it is
well that it possesses this climbing ability.According to Hallock,
the <DW53>s' abode is generally in a hollow tree, oak or chestnut, and
when the "juvenile farmer's son comes across a _Coon tree_, he is
not long in making known his discovery to friends and neighbors, who
forthwith assemble at the spot to secure it."The "sport" is in no
sense agreeable from a humane point of view, and we trust it will cease
to be regarded as such by those who indulge in it."The Raccoon makes a
heroic struggle and often puts many of his assailants _hors de combat_
for many a day, his jaws being strong and his claws sharp."The young ones are generally from four to eight, pretty little
creatures at first and about as large as half-grown Rats.They are very
playful, soon become docile and tame, but at the first chance will
wander off to the woods and not return.The <DW53> is a night animal and
never travels by day; sometimes it is said, being caught at morning far
from its tree and being unable to return thither, it will spend the
hours of daylight snugly coiled up among the thickest foliage of some
lofty tree-top.It is adroit in its attempts to baffle Dogs, and will
often enter a brook and travel for some distance in the water, thus
puzzling and delaying its pursuers.A good sized Raccoon will weigh from fifteen to twenty pounds.The curiosity of the Raccoon is one of its most interesting
characteristics.It will search every place of possible concealment for
food, examine critically any object of interest, will rifle a pocket,
stand upright and watch every motion of man or animal, and indeed show
a marked desire for all sorts of knowledge.Raccoons are apparently
happy in captivity when properly cared for by their keepers.Their Number and Variety is Increasing Instead of Diminishing.Whether in consequence of the effective working of the Wild Birds'
Charter or of other unknown causes, there can be no doubt in the
minds of observant lovers of our feathered friends that of late years
there has been a great and gratifying increase in their numbers in
and around London, especially so, of course, in the vicinity of the
beautiful open spaces which do such beneficent work silently in this
province of houses.But even in long, unlovely streets, far removed
from the rich greenery of the parks, the shabby parallelograms, by
courtesy styled gardens, are becoming more and more frequently visited
by such pretty shy songsters as Linnets, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and
Finches, who, though all too often falling victims to the predatory
Cat, find abundant food in these cramped enclosures.Naturally some
suburbs are more favored than others in this respect, notably Dulwich,
which, though fast losing its beautiful character under the ruthless
grip of the builder, still retains some delightful nooks where one may
occasionally hear the Nightingale's lovely song in its season.But the most noticable additions to the bird population of London have
been among the Starlings.Their quaint gabble and peculiar minor
whistle may now be heard in the most unexpected localities.Even
the towering mansions which have replaced so many of the slums of
Westminster find favor in their eyes, for among the thick clustering
chimneys which crown these great buildings their slovenly nests may be
found in large numbers.In some districts they are so numerous that the
irrepressible Sparrow, true London gamin that he is, finds himself in
considerable danger of being crowded out.This is perhaps most evident
on the sequestered lawns of some of the inns of the court, Gray's Inn
Square, for instance, where hundreds of Starlings at a time may now
be observed busily trotting about the greensward searching for food.Several long streets come to mind where not a house is without its pair
or more of Starlings, who continue faithful to their chosen roofs, and
whose descendants settle near as they grow up, well content with their
surroundings.House Martins, too, in spite of repeated efforts on the
part of irritated landlords to drive them away by destroying their
nests on account of the disfigurement to the front of the dwelling,
persist in returning year after year and rebuilding their ingenious
little mud cells under the eaves of the most modern suburban villas or
terrace houses.--_Pall Mall Gazette._




  [Illustration: From col.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Pigmy Antelopes present examples of singular members of the family,
in that they are of exceedingly diminutive size, the smallest being
no larger than a large Rat, dainty creatures indeed.The Pigmy is an
inhabitant of South Africa, and its habits are said to be quite similar
to those of its brother of the western portion of North America.The Antelope is a very wary animal, but the sentiment of curiosity
is implanted so strongly in its nature that it often leads it to
reconnoitre too closely some object which it cannot clearly make out,
and its investigations are pursued until "the dire answer to all
inquiries is given by the sharp'spang' of the rifle and the answering
'spat' as the ball strikes the beautiful creatures flank."The Pigmy
Antelope is not hunted, however, as is its larger congener, and may
be considered rather as a diminutive curiosity of Natures' delicate
workmanship than as the legitimate prey of man.No sooner had the twilight settled over the island than new bird voices
called from the hills about us.The birds of the day were at rest, and
their place was filled with the night denizens of the island.They
came from the dark recesses of the forests, first single stragglers,
increased by midnight to a stream of eager birds, passing to and fro
from the sea.Many, attracted by the glow of the burning logs, altered
their course and circled about the fire a few times and then sped on.From their notes we identified the principal night prowlers as the
Cassin's Auklet, Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties of Petrel.All through the night our slumbers were frequently disturbed by birds
alighting on the sides of the tent, slipping down with great scratching
into the grass below, where our excited Dog took a hand in the matter,
daylight often finding our tent strewn with birds he had captured
during the night.When he found time to sleep I do not know.He was
after birds the entire twenty-four hours.In climbing over the hills of the island we discovered the retreats of
these night birds, the soil everywhere through the deep wood being
fairly honeycombed with their nesting burrows.The larger tunnels
of the Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on the <DW72>s of the hill,
while the little burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were on top in the
flat places.We opened many of their queer abodes that ran back with
many turns to a distance of ten feet or more.One or both birds were
invariably found at the end, covering their single egg, for this
species, like many other sea birds, divide the duties of incubation,
both sexes doing an equal share, relieving each other at night.The Puffins nested in burrows also, but lower down--often just above
the surf.One must be very careful, indeed, how he thrusts his hand
into their dark dens, for should the old bird chance to be at home, its
vise-like bill can inflict a very painful wound.The rookeries of the
Murres and Cormorants were on the sides of steep cliffs overhanging the
sea.Looking down from above, hundreds of eggs could be seen, gathered
along the narrow shelves and chinks in the rocks, but accessible only
by means of a rope from the top.--_Outing._




THE RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Blue Jay
imitated, as you will remember, in the story "The New Tenants,"
published in Birds._Kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, that is my cry, very loud and plaintive;
they say I am a very noisy bird; perhaps that is the reason why Mr.Blue Jay imitates me more than he does other Hawks.I am called Chicken Hawk, and Hen Hawk, also, though I don't deserve
either of those names.There are members of our family, and oh, what
a lot of us there are--as numerous as the Woodpeckers--who do drop
down into the barnyards and right before the farmer's eyes carry off
a Chicken.Red Squirrels, to my notion, are more appetizing than
Chickens; so are Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes, and Worms.A bird
once in a while I like for variety, and between you and me, if I am
hungry, I pick up a chicken now and then, that has strayed outside the
barnyard.But only _occasionally_, remember, so that I don't deserve
the name of Chicken Hawk at all, do I?Wooded swamps, groves inhabited by Squirrels, and patches of low timber
are the places in which we make our homes.Sometimes we use an old
crow's nest instead of building one; we retouch it a little and put in
a soft lining of feathers which my mate plucks from her breast.When
we build a new nest, it is made of husks, moss, and strips of bark,
lined as the building progresses with my mate's feathers.Young lady
Red-shouldered Hawks lay three and sometimes four eggs, but the old
lady birds lay only two.Blue Jay never sees a Hawk without giving the alarm, and on
he rushes to attack us, backed up by other Jays who never fail to go
to his assistance.They often assemble in great numbers and actually
succeed in driving us out of the neighborhood.Not that we are afraid
of them, oh no!We know them to be great cowards, as well as the crows,
who harass us also, and only have to turn on our foes to put them to
rout.Sometimes we do turn, and seizing a Blue Jay, sail off with him
to the nearest covert; or in mid air strike a Crow who persistently
follows us.But as a general thing we simply ignore our little
assailants, and just fly off to avoid them.RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Hawk family is an interesting one and many of them are beautiful.The Red-shouldered Hawk is one of the finest specimens of these birds,
as well as one of the most useful.Of late years the farmer has come to
know it as his friend rather than his enemy, as formerly.It inhabits
the woodlands where it feeds chiefly upon Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice,
Moles, and Lizards.It occasionally drops down on an unlucky Duck or
Bob White, though it is not quick enough to catch the smaller birds.It is said to be destructive to domestic fowls raised in or near the
timber, but does not appear to search for food far away from its
natural haunts.As it is a very noisy bird, the birds which it might
destroy are warned of its approach, and thus protect themselves.During the early nesting season its loud, harsh _kee-oe_ is heard from
the perch and while in the air, often keeping up the cry for a long
time without intermission.Goss says that he collected at Neosho
Falls, Kansas, for several successive years a set of the eggs of this
species from a nest in the forks of a medium sized oak.In about nine
days after each robbery the birds would commence laying again, and
he allowed them to hatch and rear their young.One winter during his
absence the tree was cut down, but this did not discourage the birds,
or cause them to forsake the place, for on approach of spring he found
them building a nest not over ten rods from the old one, but this time
in a large sycamore beyond reach.This seemed to him to indicate that
they become greatly attached to the grounds selected for a home, which
they vigilantly guard, not permitting a bird of prey to come within
their limits.This species is one of the commonest in the United States, being
especially abundant in the winter, from which it receives the name of
Winter Falcon.The name of Chicken Hawk is often applied to it, though
it does not deserve the name, its diet being of a more humble kind.The eggs are usually deposited in April or May in numbers of three or
four--sometimes only two.The ground color is bluish, yellowish-white
or brownish, spotted, blotched and dotted irregularly with many shades
of reddish brown.According to
Davie, to describe all the shades of reds and browns which comprise the
variation would be an almost endless task, and a large series like this
must be seen in order to appreciate how much the eggs of this species
vary.The flight of the Red-shouldered Hawk is slow, but steady and strong
with a regular beat of the wings.They take delight in sailing in the
air, where they float lightly and with scarcely a notable motion of
the wings, often circling to a great height.During the insect season,
while thus sailing, they often fill their craws with grass-hoppers,
that, during the after part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.Venice, the pride of Italy of old, aside from its other numerous
curiosities and antiquities, has one which is a novelty indeed.Its
Doves on the San Marco Place are a source of wonder and amusement to
every lover of animal life.Their most striking peculiarity is that
they fear no mortal man, be he stranger or not.They come in countless
numbers, and, when not perched on the far-famed bell tower, are found
on the flags of San Marco Square.They are often misnamed Pigeons, but
as a matter of fact they are Doves of the highest order.They differ,
however, from our wild Doves in that they are fully three times as
large, and twice as large as our best domestic Pigeon.Their plumage
is of a soft mouse color relieved by pure white, and occasionally
one of pure white is found, but these are rare.Hold out to them a
handful of crumbs and without fear they will come, perch on your hand
or shoulder and eat with thankful coos.To strangers this is indeed
a pleasing sight, and demonstrates the lack of fear of animals when
they are treated humanely, for none would dare to injure the doves of
San Marco.He would probably forfeit his life were he to injure one
intentionally.And what beggars these Doves of San Marco are!They will
crowd around, and push and coo with their soft soothing voices, until
you can withstand them no longer, and invest a few centimes in bread
for their benefit.Their bread, by the way, is sold by an Italian, who
must certainly be in collusion with the Doves, for whenever a stranger
makes his appearance, both Doves and bread vender are at hand to beg.The most remarkable fact in connection with these Doves is that they
will collect in no other place in large numbers than San Marco Square,
and in particular at the vestibule of San Marco Church.True, they are
found perched on buildings throughout the entire city, and occasionally
we will find a few in various streets picking refuse, but they never
appear in great numbers outside of San Marco Square.The ancient bell
tower, which is situated on the west side of the place, is a favorite
roosting place for them, and on this perch they patiently wait for a
foreigner, and proceed to bleed him after approved Italian fashion.There are several legends connected with the Doves of Venice, each of
which attempts to explain the peculiar veneration of the Venetian and
the extreme liberty allowed these harbingers of peace.The one which
struck me as being the most appropriate is as follows:

Centuries ago Venice was a free city, having her own government, navy,
and army, and in a manner was considered quite a power on land and sea.The city was ruled by a Senate consisting of ten men, who were called
Doges, who had absolute power, which they used very often in a despotic
and cruel manner, especially where political prisoners were concerned.On account of the riches the city contained, and also its values as
a port, Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring nations, and, as
a consequence, was often called upon to defend itself with rather
indifferent success.In fact, Venice was conquered so often, first by
one and then another, that Venetians were seldom certain of how they
stood.They knew not whether they were slave or victor.It was during
one of these sieges that the incident of the Doves occurred.The city
had been besieged for a long time by Italians, and matters were coming
to such a pass that a surrender was absolutely necessary on account of
lack of food.In fact, the Doges had issued a decree that on the morrow
the city should surrender unconditionally.All was gloom and sorrow, and the populace stood around in groups
on the San Marco discussing the situation and bewailing their fate,
when lo!in the eastern sky there appeared a dense cloud rushing upon
the city with the speed of the wind.At first consternation reigned
supreme, and men asked each other: "What new calamity is this?"As the
cloud swiftly approached it was seen to be a vast number of Doves,
which, after hovering over the San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully
settled down upon the flagstones and approached the men without fear.Then there arose a queer cry, "The Doves!It
appears that some years before this a sage had predicted stormy times
for Venice, with much suffering and strife, but, when all seemed lost,
there would appear a multitude of Doves, who would bring Venice peace
and happiness.And so it came to pass that the next day, instead of
attacking, the besiegers left, and Venice was free again.The prophet
also stated that, so long as the Doves remained at Venice prosperity
would reign supreme, but that there would come a day when the Doves
would leave just as they had come, and Venice would pass into
oblivion.That is why Venetians take such good care of their Doves.You will not find this legend in any history, but I give it just as it
was told me by a guide, who seemed well versed in hair-raising legends.Possibly they were manufactured to order by this energetic gentleman,
but they sounded well nevertheless.Even to this day the old men of
Venice fear that some morning they will awake and find their Doves gone.There in the shadow of the famous bell-tower, with the stately San
Marco church on one side and the palace of the cruel and murderous
Doges on the other, we daily find our pretty Doves coaxing for bread.Often you will find them peering down into the dark passage-way in the
palace, which leads to the dungeons underneath the Grand Canal.What
a boon a sight of these messengers of peace would have been to the
doomed inmates of these murder-reeking caves.But happily they are now
deserted, and are used only as a source of revenue, which is paid by
the inquisitive tourist.She never changes, and the Doves of San
Marco will still remain.May we hope, with the sages of Venice, that
they may remain forever.--_Lebert, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._




BUTTERFLIES.It may appear strange, if not altogether inappropriate to the season,
that "the fair fragile things which are the resurrection of the ugly,
creeping caterpillars" should be almost as numerous in October as in
the balmy month of July.Yet it is true, and early October, in some
parts of the country, is said to be perhaps the best time of the year
for the investigating student and observer of Butterflies.While not
quite so numerous, perhaps, many of the species are in more perfect
condition, and the variety is still intact.Many of them come and
remain until frost, and the largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,
does not appear until the middle of July, but after that is constantly
with us, floating and circling on the wing, until October.How these
delicate creatures can endure even the chill of autumn days is one of
the mysteries.Very curious and interesting are the Skippers, says _Current
Literature_.They are very small insects, but their bodies are robust,
and they fly with great rapidity, not moving in graceful, wavy lines
as the true Butterflies do, but skipping about with sudden, jerky
motions.Their flight is very short, and almost always near the
ground.They can never be mistaken, as their peculiar motion renders
their identification easy.They are seen at their best in August and
September.All June and July Butterflies are August and September
Butterflies, not so numerous in some instances, perhaps, but still
plentiful, and vying with the rich hues of the changing autumnal
foliage.The "little wood brownies," or Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.Their colors are not brilliant, but plain, and they seek the quiet and
retirement of the woods, where they flit about in graceful circles over
the shady beds of ferns and woodland grasses.Many varieties of the Vanessa are often seen flying about in May, but
they are far more numerous and perfect in July, August, and September.A beautiful Azure-blue Butterfly, when it is fluttering over flowers
in the sunshine, looks like a tiny speck of bright blue satin.Several
other small Butterflies which appear at the same time are readily
distinguished by the peculiar manner in which their hind wings are
tailed.Their color is a dull brown of various shades, marked in some
of the varieties with specks of white or blue."Their presence in the gardens and meadows," says a recent writer,
"and in the fields and along the river-banks, adds another element
of gladness which we are quick to recognize, and even the plodding
wayfarer who has not the honor of a single intimate acquaintance among
them might, perhaps, be the first to miss their circlings about his
path.As roses belong to June, and chrysanthemums to November, so
Butterflies seem to be a joyous part of July.It is their gala-day,
and they are everywhere, darting and circling and sailing, dropping to
investigate flowers and overripe fruit, and rising on buoyant wings
high into the upper air, bright, joyous, airy, ephemeral.But July can
only claim the larger part of their allegiance, for they are wanderers
into all the other months, and even occasionally brave the winter with
torn and faded wings."[Illustration: BUTTERFLIES.--Life-size.Somehow people always say that when they see a Fox.I'd rather they
would call me that than stupid, however."Look pleasant," said the man when taking my photograph for Birds,
and I flatter myself I did--and intelligent, too.Look at my brainy
head, my delicate ears--broad below to catch every sound, and tapering
so sharply to a point that they can shape themselves to every wave
of sound.Note the crafty calculation and foresight of my low, flat
brow, the resolute purpose of my pointed nose; my eye deep set--like
a robber's--my thin cynical lips, and mouth open from ear to ear.You
couldn't find a better looking Fox if you searched the world over.I can leap, crawl, run, and swim, and walk so noiselessly that even the
dead leaves won't rustle under my feet.It takes a deal of cunning for
a Fox to get along in this world, I can tell you.I'd go hungry if I
didn't plan and observe the habits of other creatures.When I want one for my supper off I trot to the nearest
stream, and standing very quiet, watch till I spy a nice, plump trout
in the clear water.A leap, a snap, and it is all over with Mr.Another time I feel as though I'd like a crawfish.I see one snoozing
by his hole near the water's edge.I drop my fine, bushy tail into the
water and tickle him on the ear.That makes him furious--nobody likes
to be wakened from a nap that way--and out he darts at the tail; snap
go my jaws, and Mr.Crawfish is crushed in them, shell and all.Between you and me, I consider that a very clever trick, too.How I love the green fields,
the ripening grain, the delicious fruits, for then the Rabbits prick up
their long ears, and thinking themselves out of danger, run along the
hillside; then the quails skulk in the wheat stubble, and the birds hop
and fly about the whole day long.I am very fond of Rabbits, Quails,
and other Birds.For dessert I have
only to sneak into an orchard and eat my fill of apples, pears, and
grapes.You perceive I have very good reason for liking the summer.It's the merriest time of the year for me, and my cubs.They grow fat
and saucy, too.The only Foxes that are hunted (the others only being taken by means of
traps or poison) are the Red and Gray species.The Gray Fox is a more
southern species than the Red and is rarely found north of the state
of Maine.Indeed it is said to be not common anywhere in New England.In the southern states, however, it wholly replaces the Red Fox, and,
according to Hallock, one of the best authorities on game animals in
this country, causes quite as much annoyance to the farmer as does
that proverbial and predatory animal, the terror of the hen-roost and
the smaller rodents.The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller than the Red and
differs from him in being wholly dark gray "mixed hoary and black."He
also differs from his northern cousin in being able to climb trees.Although not much of a runner, when hard pressed by the dog he will
often ascend the trunk of a leaning tree, or will even climb an erect
one, grasping the trunk in his arms as would a Bear.Nevertheless the
Fox is not at home among the branches, and looks and no doubt feels
very much out of place while in this predicament.The ability to climb,
however, often saves him from the hounds, who are thus thrown off the
scent and Reynard is left to trot home at his leisure.Foxes live in holes of their own making, generally in the loamy soil
of a side hill, says an old Fox hunter, and the she-Fox bears four or
five cubs at a litter.When a fox-hole is discovered by the Farmers
they assemble and proceed to dig out the inmates who have lately, very
likely, been making havoc among the hen-roosts.An amusing incident,
he relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will
bear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by
means of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had
been making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the
neighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that
account.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,
and accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The
hole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious
and continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and
Rep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had
waxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous
melee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his
hoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the
maze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement
of the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who
with a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding
head, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of
the turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid
aside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over
the crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,
will soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers
of very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular
runs, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and
the use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw
off the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support
their ancient reputation for cunning.Copyright by

abounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested, they are as tame as a
poultry yard, making the country one vast aviary.Yellow-beaked Minas,
Ring-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry
Palm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out
of the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is
alive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every
size and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up
to the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a
dead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and
presently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in
charge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through
the surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers
flash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight."----

WARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have
been made in India by Mr.He concludes
that there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous
birds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that
many, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate
in comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and
three other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with
bad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also
experimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate
the nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----

INCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The
establishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United
States.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000
acres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,
200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild
Boar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a
preserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,
Muledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.
C. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near
Lenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves
are Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,
near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,
Washington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;
and Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----

ROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the
ground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is
timber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very
abundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without
unusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or
yellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this
color through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels
are often found associating together.They are said to be in every
respect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every
detail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as
distinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,
an anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct
explanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning
just after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their
hole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when
they again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter
lies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and
chattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless
on a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the
slightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he
at all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular
locality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black
Squirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have
several young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast
and other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the
Niagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed
to hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The
current is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally
ventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a
boy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel
into deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The
"sport" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a
rebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any
household tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is
willing to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with
them, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to
exterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and
was rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white
Rabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before
been molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to
see examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,
    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,
      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,
      I only meant to give him a scare,
      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--
      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see
      He never would sing for you or me
      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,
      Never more in the sunshine bright,
      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,
      How never, never, I can repay
      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works
on ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most
curious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South
America, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent
occurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move
in flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking
and probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,
insects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; "but at the
report of a gun," says Col.Goss, "or any sudden fright, spring into
the air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying
swift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted
often circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally
a timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,
sometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground."Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until
recently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and
sent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and
to the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND
ALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more
distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my
position, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,
and again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The
open flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance
revealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of
the bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded
opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under
a variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the
light Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the
same time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of
the syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_."The bird
may frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,
its enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for
high and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a
depression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are
four, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Why was the sight
    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,
    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;
    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON."But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration
are capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,
the mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of
thought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges
in power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light
and darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects
of various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a
 mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist
not far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was
once merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action
of light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the
least complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain
substances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to
continued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina
has apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a
fly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along
the line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium
the presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that
certain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly
by the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat
waves as such have no effect upon the retina.By separating the light
and heat rays from an electric lantern and focusing the latter, he
brought their combined energy to play where his own eye could be placed
directly in contact with them, first protecting the exterior of his
eye from the heat rays.There was no sensation whatever as a result,
but when, directly afterward, he placed a sheet of platinum at the
convergence of the dark rays it quickly became red hot with the energy
which his eye was unable to recognize.The eye is a camera obscura with a very imperfect lens and a receiving
plate irregularly sensitized; but it has marvelous powers of quick
adjustment.The habits of the animal determine the character of the
eye.Birds of rapid flight and those which scan the earth minutely
from lofty courses are able to adjust their vision quickly to long and
short range.The eye of the Owl is subject to his will as he swings
noiselessly down upon the Mouse in the grass.The nearer the object the
more the eye is protruded and the deeper its form from front to rear.The human eye adjusts its power well for small objects within a few
inches and readily reaches out for those several miles away.A curious
feature is that we are able to adjust the eye for something at long
range in less time than for something close at hand.If we are reading
and someone calls our attention to an object on the distant hillside,
the eye adjusts itself to the distance in less than a second, but when
we return our vision to the printed page several seconds are consumed
in the re-adjustment.The Condor of the Andes has great powers of sight.He wheels in
beautiful curves high in the air scrutinizing the ground most carefully
and all the time apparently keeping track of all the other Condors
within a range of several miles.No sooner does one of his kind descend
to the earth than those near him shoot for the same spot hoping the
find may be large enough for a dinner party.Others soaring at greater
distances note their departure and follow in great numbers so that when
the carcass discovered by one Condor proves to be a large one, hundreds
of these huge birds congregate to enjoy the feast.The Condor's
eyes have been well compared to opera glasses, their extension and
contraction are so great.The Eagle soars towards the sun with fixed gaze and apparent fullness
of enjoyment.This would ruin his sight were it not for the fact
that he and all other birds are provided with an extra inner eyelid
called the nictitating membrane which may be drawn at will over the
eye to protect it from too strong a light.Cuvier made the discovery
that the eye of the Eagle, which had up to his time been supposed of
peculiarly great strength to enable it to feast upon the sun's rays, is
closed during its great flights just as the eye of the barnyard fowl
is occasionally rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent
membrane.Several of the mammals, among them being the horse, are
equipped with such an inner eyelid.One of my most striking experiences on the ocean was had when I pulled
in my first Flounder and found both of his eyes on the same side of
his head.On the side which
glides over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut, Turbot, Plaice, and
Sole are almost white, the upper side being dark enough to be scarcely
distinguishable from the ground.On the upper side are the two eyes,
while the lower side is blind.When first born the fish swims upright with a slight tendency to favor
one side; its eyes are on opposite sides of the head, as in most
vertebrates and the head itself is regular.With age and experience in
exploring the bottom on one side, the under eye refuses to remain away
from the light and gradually turns upward, bringing with it the bones
of the skull to such an extent that the adult Flat-fish becomes the
apparently deformed creature that appears in our markets as a regular
product of the deep.The eyeless inhabitant of the streams in Mammoth Cave presents a
curious instance of the total loss of a sense which remains unused.These little fishes are not only without sight but are also almost
destitute of color and markings, the general appearance being much like
that of a fish with the skin taken off for the frying pan.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying
power.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of
Cetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in
the eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long
vertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many
other grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.Insects present a wonderful array of eyes.These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in
whatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has
fifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and
so arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of
the industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with
great rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which
calls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly
is supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all
is the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with
twenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood
      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food
      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking
      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;
    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys
    To share with him come with so great a noise
    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,
    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,
    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;
    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes
    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;
    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado
    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;
    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;
    Another cries behind for being last;
    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa
    The little fool with no small sport they follow,
    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray
    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Birds and all Nature, Vol.I suppose monkeys are always cold here; at any
rate, this one was; and when he saw the hostler give the horse a nice
feed of hay, he said to himself, 'What a comfortable bed that would make
for me!'"When the man went away, he jumped into the hay and hid, and every time
the horse came near enough to eat, he sprang forward and bit her ears
with his sharp teeth."Of course, as the poor horse couldn't get her food, she grew very thin,
and at last was so frightened that the hostler could scarcely get her
into the stall.Several times he had to whip her before she would enter
it, and then she stood as far back as possible, trembling like a leaf."It was a long time before they found out what the matter was; and then
the monkey had to take a whipping, I guess.""If his mother had been there, she would have whipped him," said Minnie,
laughing.The little girl then repeated what her mother had told her of the
discipline among monkeys, at which he was greatly amused.All this time, they were standing at the bottom of the hay mow, and
supposed that Jacko was safe at the top; but the little fellow was more
cunning than they thought.He found the window open near the roof, where
hay was sometimes pitched in, and ran down into the yard as quick as
lightning.The first they knew of it was when John called out from the barnyard,
"Jacko, Jacko!It was a wearisome chase they had for the next hour, and at the end they
could not catch the runaway; but at last, when they sat down calmly in
the house, he stole back to his cage, and lay there quiet as a lamb.Minnie's face was flushed with her unusual exercise, but in a few
minutes she grew very pale, until her mother became alarmed.After a few
drops of lavender, however, she said she felt better, and that if Frank
would tell her a story she should be quite well."That I will," exclaimed the boy, eagerly."I know a real funny one;
you like funny stories--don't you?""Yes, when they're true," answered Minnie.A man was hunting, and he happened to kill a
monkey that had a little baby on her back.The little one clung so close
to her dead mother, that they could scarcely get it away.When they
reached the gentleman's house, the poor creature began to cry at
finding itself alone.All at once it ran across the room to a block,
where a wig belonging to the hunter's father was placed, and thinking
that was its mother, was so comforted that it lay down and went to
sleep."They fed it with goat's milk, and it grew quite contented, for three
weeks clinging to the wig with great affection."The gentleman had a large and valuable collection of insects, which
were dried upon pins, and placed in a room appropriated to such
purposes."One day, when the monkey had become so familiar as to be a favorite
with all in the family, he found his way to this apartment, and made a
hearty breakfast on the insects."The owner, entering when the meal was almost concluded, was greatly
enraged, and was about to chastise the animal, who had so quickly
destroyed the work of years, when he saw that the act had brought its
own punishment.In eating the insects, the animal had swallowed the
pins, which very soon caused him such agony that he died.""I don't call the last part funny at all," said Minnie, gravely."But wasn't it queer for it to think the wig was its mother?"asked the
boy, with a merry laugh."I don't think it could have had much sense to
do that.""But it was only a baby monkey then, Harry."Lee, "that Jacko got away from you?""He watched his chance, aunty, and twitched the chain away from Minnie.Now he's done it once, he'll try the game again, I suppose, he is so
fond of playing us tricks."And true enough, the very next morning the lady was surprised at a visit
from the monkey in her chamber, where he made himself very much at home,
pulling open drawers, and turning over the contents, in the hope of
finding some confectionery, of which he was extremely fond."Really," she exclaimed to her husband, "if Jacko goes on so, I shall
be of cook's mind, and not wish to live in the house with him."One day, Jacko observed nurse washing out some fine clothes for her
mistress, and seemed greatly interested in the suds which she made in
the progress of her work.Watching his chance, he went to Mrs.Lee's room while the family were at
breakfast one morning, and finding some nice toilet soap on the marble
washstand, began to rub it on some fine lace lying on the bureau.After
a little exertion, he was delighted to find that he had a bowl full of
nice, perfumed suds, and was chattering to himself in great glee, when
Ann came in and spoiled his sport."You good for nothing, mischievous creature," she cried out, in sudden
wrath, "I'll cure you of prowling about the house in this style."Giving him a cuff across his head with a shoe, "Go back to your cage,
where you belong.""Jacko is really getting to be very troublesome," remarked the lady to
her husband."I can't tell how much longer my patience with him will
last.""Would Minnie mourn very much if she were to lose him?""I suppose she would for a time; but then she has so many pets to take
up her attention."Just then the child ran in, her eyes filled with tears, exclaiming,--

"Father, does Jacko know any better?"Because," she went on, "I found him crouched down in his cage, looking
very sorry; and nurse says he ought to be ashamed of himself, cutting
up such ridiculous capers.""I dare say he feels rather guilty," remarked Mr."He must be
taught better, or your mother will be tired of him."When her father had gone to the city, Minnie looked so grave that her
mother, to comfort her, took the book and read her some stories.A few
of them I will repeat to you."A lady was returning from India, in a ship on board of which there was
a monkey.She was a very mild, gentle creature, and readily learned any
thing that was taught her.When she went to lie down at night, she made
up her bed in imitation of her mistress, then got in and wrapped herself
up neatly with the quilt.Sometimes she would wrap her head with a
handkerchief."When she did wrong, she would kneel and clasp her hands, seeming
earnestly to ask to be forgiven.""That's a good story, mamma.""Yes, dear; and here is another.""A gentleman boarding with his wife at a hotel in Paris had a pet
monkey, who was very polite.One day his master met him going down
stairs; and when the gentleman said 'good morning,' the animal took off
his cap and made a very polite bow.Upon
this the monkey held out a square piece of paper.said the gentleman; 'your mistress' gown is dusty.'"Jack instantly took a small brush from his master's pocket, raised the
hem of the lady's dress, cleaned it, and then did the same to his
master's shoes, which were also dusty."When they gave him any thing to eat, he did not cram his pouches with
it, but delicately and tidily devoured it; and when, as frequently
occurred, strangers gave him money, he always put it in his master's
hands.""Do you think, mamma, I could teach Jacko to do so?"inquired Minnie,
eagerly."I can't say, my dear; and indeed I think it would be hardly worth the
pains to spend a great deal of time in teaching him.He seems to learn
quite fast enough by himself.Indeed, he is so full of tricks, and so
troublesome to cook in hiding her kitchen utensils, I am afraid we shall
have to put him in close confinement.""I had rather uncle Frank would carry him back to Africa," sighed the
child."Well, dear, I wouldn't grieve about it now.We must manage somehow till
uncle Frank comes, and then perhaps he can tell us what to do."A monkey living with a gentleman in the country became so troublesome
that the servants were constantly complaining.""That seems similar to our case," said the lady, smiling, as she
interrupted the reading."One day, having his offers of assistance rudely repulsed, he went into
the next house by a window in the second story, which was unfortunately
open.Here he pulled out a small drawer, where the lady kept ribbons,
laces, and handkerchiefs, and putting them in a foot-tub, rubbed away
vigorously for an hour, with all the soap and water there were to be
found in the room."When the lady returned to the chamber, he was busily engaged in
spreading the torn and disfigured remnants to dry."He knew well enough he was doing wrong; for, without her speaking to
him, he made off quickly and ran home, where he hid himself in the case
of the large kitchen clock."The servants at once knew he had been in mischief, as this was his
place of refuge when he was in disgrace."One day he watched the cook while she was preparing some partridges for
dinner, and concluded that all birds ought to be so treated.He soon
managed to get into the yard, where his mistress kept a few pet bantam
fowls, and, after eating their eggs, he secured one of the hens, and
began plucking it.The noise of the poor bird called some of the
servants to the rescue, when they found the half-plucked creature in
such a pitiable condition that they killed it at once.Monkey was chained up, and soon died."Minnie looked very grave after hearing this story, and presently said,
"I wonder how old that monkey was.""The book does not mention his age, my dear."I was thinking that perhaps, as Jacko grows older, he may learn better;
and then I said to myself, 'That one must have been young.'""If a monkey is really inclined to be vicious, he is almost unbearable,"
remarked the lady."His company does not begin to compensate for the
trouble he makes.Sometimes he is only cunning, but otherwise mild and
tractable.""And which, mamma, do you think Jacko is?""I have always thought, until lately, that he was one of the better
kind; but I have now a good many doubts whether you enjoy her funny
tricks enough to compensate cook for all the mischief she does.If I
knew any one who wanted a pet monkey, and would treat him kindly, I
should be glad to have him go.screamed Minnie, with a look of horror; "O, mamma, I wouldn't
have one of my pets killed for any thing."Lee thought that would probably be at some time Nannie's fate, but
she wisely said nothing.I don't want to think about such awful
things."The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.Presently
she said, "Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but
first I must explain to you what a sounding-board is."In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the
pulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was
thought, assisted the minister's voice to be heard by all the
congregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my
grandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a
sounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would
fall on the minister's head and kill him."There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept
in his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,
which was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he
went out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out
of sight, on his way to church."But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under
his arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the
opportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,
ran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board."Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on
the congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle."The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much
enjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the
sounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was
unconscious of his presence."When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with
laughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it
his duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action
of his hands and arms."The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every
motion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the
countenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the
most solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity
appear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,
every word being enforced by great energy of action."All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with
ardor and exactness."The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man
and his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of
composure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one
of the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the
irreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the
merriment."Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal
standing on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his
might, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly
exasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey
removed, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to
recover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed."CHAPTER V.

JACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching
mice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to
good account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,
determined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.Lee on a journey,
and shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his
comfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every
thing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and
well secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this
treatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup
tureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over
the place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke
shivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup
tureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he
began to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on
the upper shelf."There is something good," he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,
raspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,
disappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in
a corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave
a scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a
thousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her
that this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,
who began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his
stomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his
excess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an
experiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new
mischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,
laughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as
he said, "We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;
but you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.""Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?""I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I
can find any for you."He opened the book, and then asked,--

"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in
their cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the
animal look wrinkled?""No, sir; I never heard about it."He puts his food in them, and keeps it there
till he wishes to devour it."There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;
that is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,
and which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The
facility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the
branches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it
makes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,
it is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it
to swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.""I'm sure, father," eagerly cried Minnie, "that Jacko has a prehensile
tail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the
hay mow."But here is an
account of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black
hands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called
Hoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be
one of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to
death; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy
great quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by
the natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone
would compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us
that their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are
raised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in
which they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A
hand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum
in Paris.""Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures
or hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other
substances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they
do not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general
cry being kept up by the party."One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor."Mamma," she
exclaimed, "cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families."I suppose, my dear," she responded, "that there is a
difference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very
fond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount
them on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection."But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,
and if I can find the book, I will read it to you.""There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most
beautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from
its extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at
liberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in
order to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a
wife."For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every
attention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much
cruelty."One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than
usual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,
after winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and
drew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave
her a push, which threw her into the sea."This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he
descended in high spirits.""I should think they would have punished him," said Minnie, with great
indignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no
means always to be depended upon."Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one
more story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,
complied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this
chapter on Minnie's pet monkey."A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented
to his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it."Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress
used sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him
run up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper."On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,
ran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and
chattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,
'Catch me if you can.'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally
leaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled
himself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth
open, his sides ready to burst with his running."Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former
experience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at
cleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the
handle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he
relinquished the sport."Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and
boots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering
all the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole
and all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &
Martin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was
a nice mess for some days after."One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found
Sprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and
arranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he
heard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as
though nothing had happened."Sprite was exceedingly fond of a bath.Occasionally a bowl of water was
given him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his
finger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the
other, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed
himself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped
out and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during
this performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his
might to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over
them.As he was brought from a
very warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the
cold."The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his
basket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning
he frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of
making the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet."One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on
the tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her."Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from
his basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it
just the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving
only his head above the water."This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water
began to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly
sat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have
been boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and
firmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,
who, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head
and pulled him out."He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon
recovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot
experience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire."When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a
menagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was
greatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty
questions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their
way home, she inquired,--

"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?""Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot
conceive of.""I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets," added her
mother, laughing."I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,"
answered the child."But, father, will you please tell me something
more about the curious animals?"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had
stopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered
about some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to
get out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,
and then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in
the road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had
gone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which
Minnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like
her.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it
seemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he
found her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave
John orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering
whether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy
paid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature
must be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many
admonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her
thoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the
animal, which he read to her."The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like
head, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form
and position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and
hands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as
it is disgusting.""Then follows an account," the gentleman went on, "of the peculiarities
of different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.""But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?""I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that
they are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper."They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the
severest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to
their own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions
are cruel, destructive, and disgusting.""I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples," said Minnie; "but
he did not give them any meat all the time I was there.""No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable
matter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of
Good Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to
destroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and
gardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the
dogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the
gun."As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage
increases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible
fury.""Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking
encyclopaedia."Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless
they go into gardens?""I rather think I should soon convince them they
were not to enter my garden," he said, emphatically."But seriously,
they descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in
a few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,
they move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to
give notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,
the sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with
the greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into
their cheek pouches."Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her
mother said, "I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named
Kees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.""Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,"
said the gentleman, rising."It was in a book of travels in Africa," the lady went on."The
traveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his
journey, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a
sentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his
sense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of
prey, when every thing was apparently secure."There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they
came across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were
unacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he
threw them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or
disagreeable, and left them untasted."Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these
excursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the
sport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he
showed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance
about, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was
very fond."I recall one amusing trick of Kees," said the lady, laughing, "which
pleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows
of trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of
which his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he
would run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it
as fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him."These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner
of doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong
teeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself
gradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,
while he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,
which gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come
out."Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired
with the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the
dogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew
weary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into
service.As soon as Kees leaped on
his back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the
spot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until
the party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great
haste to overtake their master."Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were
accustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the
slightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their
places about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them
came too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,
and thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.""Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed," said Minnie,
with considerable warmth."I have told you the best traits of his character," she answered,
smiling."He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He
could not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He
understood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take
the cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it
whenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these
misdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good."Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his
servants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any
thing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,
generally deserved it."The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the
place; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the
broken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a
severe beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the
gentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as
soon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast."One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of
a bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had
carefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran
out of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,
but found not a bean left, and Kees missing."When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some
hours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched
every where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really
deserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a
distance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and
spoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not
come down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take
him.""No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only
one thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le
Vaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,
pretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that
time could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at
a distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;
and had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the
insult."*       *       *       *       *

went on; "I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the
Russian.It didn't last long; Camille Leroux had her share of
it--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an
Austrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter
in summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in
those days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and
of course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman
to prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter
and fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old
fellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at
Vienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good
old Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian
besides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]

"After the old man's death," my friend continued, "Pochard drifted from
bad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on
the other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until
he was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the
Quarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,"
said Lachaume, "and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there
by the door--they are handing him a small bundle?""Yes," said I, "something wrapped in newspaper.""Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just
finished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it
half an hour ago as he passed."No, to sell," Lachaume replied, "together with the other bones he is
able to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,
where the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy
Pochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in
some equally dirty 'boite,' they will pour him out his green treasure of
absinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the
Austrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.[Illustration: GEROME]

Marguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio
the other day of just such a "pauvre homme" she once knew."When he was
young," she said, "he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and
afterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of
the cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old
man![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]

"Many grow old so young," she continued; "I knew a little model once
with a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and
had she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have
earned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time
with this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine
'svelte' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were
gone.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over
thirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine
lines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have
much to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable
home; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to
keep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then
go back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO]

"In the summer," she went on, "we take a little place outside of Paris
for a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;
he is a repairer of fans and objets d'art.You should come in and see us
some time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.Ah yes," she
exclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, "I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en
plein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was
absolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]

"Once"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--"I went to England to
pose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I
stayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always
cold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going
to the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!He was a
celebrated painter, a 'Sir,' and lived with his family in a big stone
house with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always
tea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of
Madame Giraud's vin ordinaire, and a poulet.So I left and came back to
Paris.J'etais toujours, toujours
triste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that's not
bad, is it?and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for
the painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor's.Some
of the sculptors' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien's studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was
working on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared
with what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a
cheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half
an hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the
blanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is
no time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day."[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]

And so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the
life of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure
wrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French
sculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell
one sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the
sculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this "vrai type"--about seventeen years of
age--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of
delicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little
white bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,
strong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her
such a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and
so, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it
was far more independent, for one could go about and see one's
friends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same
street where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she
looked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning's
work in her reticule, and said:

"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her
brother to Vincennes.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]

It would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was
not even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who
posed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would
have handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,
went to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a
beautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at
the enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little
Parisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are
celebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately
uncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and
Methuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,
black-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years
of age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who
get anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who
has served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous
generals of the world and Jeanne d'Arcs to battle--in many a modern
public square.CHAPTER VIII

THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS


In this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the
day in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The
gardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the
Renaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees
stretching up to the Place de l'Observatoire, afford the great
breathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not
find a more interesting and representative sight of student life than
between the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the
military band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon
when Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one's
friends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The
walks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,
and hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older
people--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,
and gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of
twenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool
shadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof
of green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,
gray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

There is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the
rear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and
drinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of
the band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in
twos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that
genuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the
French and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch
the passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer "types,"
many of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the
Luxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they
emerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn
volume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of
expression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,
perhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling
over his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped
evenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,
a dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the
clergy, and a velvet tam-o'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his
teeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see
that to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the
world worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l'Observatoire
and the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at
the ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of
one of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,
flattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conceals them,
but all the rest of her face, except her two merry black eyes and her
saucy and neatly rouged lips.She is in black bicycle bloomers and a
white, short duck jacket--a straw hat with a wide blue ribbon band, and
a fluffy piece of white tulle tied at the side of her neck.It is impossible, in such a close
crowd, to be in a hurry; besides, one never is here.Near-by sit two old ladies, evidently concierges from some atelier
court.One holds the printed program of the music, cut carefully from
her weekly newspaper; it is cheaper than buying one for two sous, and
these old concierges are economical.In this Friday gathering you will recognize dozens of faces which you
have seen at the "Bal Bullier" and the cafes.The girl in the blue tailor-made dress, with the little dog, who you
remember dined the night before at the Pantheon, is walking now arm in
arm with a tall man in black, a mourning band about his hat.The girl is
dressed in black, too--a mark of respect to her ami by her side.The
dog, who is so small that he slides along the walk every time his chain
is pulled, is now tucked under her arm.One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six
students and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the
last fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet
gown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking "type"
with the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps
the rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a
great favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a
whole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The
fellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but
full of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is
explaining a very sad "histoire" to the "type" next to her, intense in
the recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when
words and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting
every sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous
frame could express no more--and all about her little dog "Loisette!"[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,
and Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw
'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,
that grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;
and you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous
of me--that is it--oh!Poor
'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.Yes, she shall see what it
will be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and
her wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be
treated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet."The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I
remember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up
her pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them
on the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate
all garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the
police, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,
and the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy
and painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was
lowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt
sure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to
her--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had
he had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of
his return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to
quarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was
her green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did
not answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes
on her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows
above yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

you any evening."said Dan to himself, "that's the queerest match I ever
heard of.She might take Shorty up in her arms and carry him off.I
don't think he'll beat her very often," and Dan smiled at the thought.The morning wore away, and at eleven o'clock Dan had earned forty cents.There didn't seem to be much prospect of
raising the rent before twelve o'clock.CHAPTER V.

EFFECTING A LOAN.As Dan stood on the sidewalk with his bundle of papers, and only forty
cents toward the two dollars and a half required for the rent, he felt
like many a business man who has a note to meet and not enough money on
hand to pay it.Indeed, he was worse off, for generally business men
have friends who can help them with a temporary loan, but Dan's friends
were quite as poor as himself.One, however, Dick Stanton, a mere boy,
had the reputation of being more saving than his companions.It was
known that he had an account in the Bowery Savings Bank, and among the
street boys he was considered wealthy."Perhaps I can borrow two dollars of him," thought Dan, as Dick passed
him on his way to Canal street."I say, Dick," said Dan, "stop a minute."I want you to lend me two dollars.Our rent is due, and I can raise it
all but that."Dick shook his head, and was about to speak, when Dan said hurriedly,
for he felt that it was his last chance:

"You needn't be afraid of me, Dick; I'll pay you sure, and give you more
interest, too, than you get in the bank.""I haven't got any money in the bank, Dan.""You had last week," said Dan, suspiciously."So I had, but I haven't now.""You don't want to lend--that's what's the matter."I'm not a bit afraid of lending to you, but I
have lent my money already."asked Dan, ungrammatically, falling into a mistake made by
plenty of greater age and better experience than himself."Of course it
isn't any of my business," he added, "if you don't want to tell.""I don't mind telling you, Dan.She's got two
children, and a hard time to get along.Perhaps I shall never see it
again, but I couldn't refuse her.""Of course you couldn't," said Dan, heartily."You've done right, and
you won't be sorry for it.I wish I knew some way of making two dollars
before twelve o'clock.""Are you in urgent need of two dollars, my boy?"Dan turned, and met the face of the stranger introduced in the first
chapter."Have you been extravagant and run up bills, Dan?""No, sir; the only bill we have is the rent, and that comes due this
noon.""I thought you said you wanted to borrow _two_ dollars.""I've got four dollars toward it, sir.""Do you often fall behind when rent day comes, Dan?""No, sir; this is the first time in two years."Has business been duller than usual during
the last month?""Yes, sir, I think it has.There hasn't been as much news in the papers,
and my sales have fallen off."Mother has a dollar and twenty cents due her, and she can't collect
it."Gripp won't pay till she has made a full dozen.""I've a great mind to buy the debt of you.""I wish you would, sir," said Dan, eagerly."That would leave only sixty
cents short, for I shall make ten cents more before twelve o'clock, it's
likely."To put you quite at ease, I mean to lend
you five dollars, and help you collect your mother's bill.""You are very kind, sir," said Dan, surprised and grateful; "but I don't
need so much.""You may get short again when I am not here to assist you.""Are you not afraid I shall never pay you, sir?""That thought won't keep me awake nights," said the gentleman, laughing."You sha'n't lose anything by me, sir; I promise you that," said Dan,
earnestly."Then come into the hotel with me, and we will arrange the matter in a
business-like way."Dan followed his new friend into the Astor House, and up stairs into a
pleasant bedroom, which in its comfortable apartments reminded Dan of
the days before his father's failure."I wish I could live so again," he thought."I don't like a
tenement-house."Grant--for this was his name--took writing materials from his
valise, and seated himself at a table."I am going to draw up a note for you to sign," he said."I probably
understand better than you the necessary form."His pen ran rapidly over the paper, and in a minute or two he handed Dan
the following form of acknowledgment:


     "NEW YORK, Sept."For value received I promise to pay to Alexander Grant five
     dollars on demand with interest."Grant, "put your name at the bottom.""I added 'with interest,' but only as a form; I shall require none."interest make it
amount to in a year?""Five dollars and thirty cents," answered Dan, promptly.I see you have not forgotten what you learned in school.""I have ciphered through cube root," said Dan, with some pride."I am
not sure whether I remember that now, but I could do any sum in square
root.""It is a pity you could not have remained in school.""I should like to; but it's no use crying for spilt milk.""As long as you didn't spill it yourself," added Mr."No, sir; it was not my fault that I had to leave school."Grant folded up the note and carefully deposited it in his wallet."The next thing is to hand you the money," he said."Shall I give you a
five-dollar bill, or small bills?""Small bills, sir, if it is just as convenient."Grant placed in Dan's hands two two-dollar bills and a one.Gripp for the money
due your mother.It is as well to have it in your own handwriting.I
won't tell you how to write it."On the whole," said he, "I believe I will take you with me when I call
upon Mr.Can you call here at three o'clock this afternoon?"Gripp will be any more
polite to me than he was to you.""He will be surprised to see me in your company," said Dan, laughing."It is a good thing to surprise the enemy, Dan.said Dan to himself, as he emerged into the street."Who would have thought that a stranger would lend me so large a sum?Now, if I could only sell the four papers
I have left before twelve o'clock.I don't want to get stuck on them."In ten minutes he had sold his
papers, and turned his steps toward the humble home where his mother was
awaiting, not without anxiety, the visit of an unamiable landlord.Mordaunt looked up anxiously as Dan entered the room.She had
little expectation that he had been able in one morning to make up the
large deficiency in the sum reserved for the rent, but there was a
possibility, and she clung to that.Dan thought of postponing the
relation of his good news, but when he saw his mother's anxious face, he
felt that it would be cruel.So when she said, "Well, Dan?""I've got it, mother," he said."You see He hasn't forgotten us," said Dan, gleefully."No, my boy, it is a rebuke to my momentary want of faith.How could you
raise so large a sum?Surely you did not earn it in one forenoon?"I'm not smart enough to earn two dollars
before twelve o'clock.""But you've got the money, Dan?""Look at this, mother," and Dan displayed the bills."I didn't know we had a friend left, able or willing to lend us that
sum.""I borrowed them of Alexander Grant, of St.Louis, and gave my note for
them," answered Dan, in a tone of some importance."He's a new friend of mine, mother.I haven't known him over twenty-four
hours.As the old friends have treated us so badly, I'm goin' in for new
ones.""He's very kind to a stranger, Dan.Heaven will reward him, I am sure."I should enjoy helping
those who needed it.If I ever get rich--though it doesn't look much
like it now--I will do all the good I can.I wonder rich men don't do it
oftener.""It springs from thoughtlessness sometimes, Dan.""And from selfishness pretty often," added Dan, whose views of human
nature were considerably less favorable than they had been in his more
prosperous days."A good many men are like Tom Carver, as he is now and
will be when he is grown up.""Perhaps there are more good and generous men than we suppose, Dan,"
urged his mother, who liked to think well of her fellow-beings.Just you step into
the bedroom, mother."Mordaunt had no desire to meet Mr.Grab, but she was a little
afraid of Dan's impetuous temper."You will treat him respectfully, won't you, Dan?"she urged, as she
turned to go into the adjoining room."I'll treat him with all the respect he deserves, mother," he answered.Mordaunt looked a little doubtful, for she understood Dan, but did
not say more, for Mr."Don't come out, whatever you hear, mother," said Dan, in a low voice."I'll come out all right, though I shall tantalize him a little at
first."Dan called out, in a loud, clear tone.The door opened, and a thin, undersized man, with bushy red hair and the
look of a cross mastiff, entered the room.Before his entrance Dan had seated himself in the plain wooden
rocking-chair with his feet on a cricket.He looked quite easy and
unconcerned."You might call me _Mr._ Grab," returned the landlord, angrily."I've no objection, I'm sure, Mr."I am perfectly well, and I am not yellow at all."I wouldn't do that for a cent, Mr.I am glad you feel well,
though you ain't looking so.It's very friendly of you to come round to
see me and mother.""She is engaged just now, and won't have the pleasure of seeing you.""I've seen more of you than I want to already," said Grab."That isn't talking like a friend, Mr.Grab," said Dan, "when I'm so
glad to see you."Of course I have come on business, and you know very well what that
business is, you young monkey."It isn't about the
rent, is it?""Oh, dear, how could I have forgotten that it was rent-day," said Dan,
with well-feigned confusion.He concluded that he wasn't going to collect
the rent, and that always chafed him."It's your business to know when rent-day comes," he said, bringing down
his fist with such emphasis on the table that he hurt his knuckles, to
Dan's secret delight."Please don't break the table, Grab," said Dan.said Grab, surveying his red knuckles."We haven't got any blasting powder, and I don't think it would be a
very interesting experiment.It might blow you up, for you are nearest
to it.""Have done with this trifling, boy," said the landlord."I am afraid you got out of the wrong end of the bed this morning, Mr."Look here, boy," said the landlord, savagely, "do you know what I am
tempted to do?""I am strongly tempted to chastise you for your impudence."Dan looked critically at the small, thin form, and secretly decided that
Mr.Grab would find it difficult to carry out his threat."I don't believe I shall sleep any
to-night."Grab made a motion to pound on the table again, but he looked at his
red knuckles and wisely forbore."I can't waste any more time," he said."You must pay your rent, or turn
out.The rent must be paid to-day, or out you go.""Really, he
ought not to tease the poor man so.He has such a bad temper, he might
hurt Dan."As soon as he pays her, I will call
round at your office and pay you.""I won't let you stay here another night, and
I mean to have security for my money, too."So saying, the landlord seized the bundle of vests which lay on the
table beside him.He sprang to his feet, his eyes flashing with anger."Then pay me my rent," said the landlord, recoiling a little."Put down that bundle before you say another word about rent.It isn't
my mother's or mine."What do you mean, boy, by your impudence?"demanded the landlord, a
little uneasily."I mean that if you take that bundle from the room, I shall put you in
charge of the nearest policeman on a charge of stealing.""That is nonsense," said Grab; but he looked nervous, and laid down the
bundle."Now, as I don't want any more of your
company, I'll pay the rent, if you'll give me a receipt.""It isn't my business what you think.There, that is settled, and now,
Mr.Grab, I have the honor of wishing you good-evening.I hope you won't
hurt your knuckles again."Grab left the room, inwardly wishing that he could wring Dan's neck.asked his mother, reproachfully, as she
re-entered the room."Didn't he turn out the poor Donovans on
a cold day last winter?"Not as long as we pay the rent."Punctually at three o'clock Dan knocked at the door of Mr.Grant's room
in the Astor House.That gentleman looked at his watch as he admitted our hero."You are punctual to the minute," he said."I'll tell you why," answered Dan, smiling."I always keep it at
Tiffany's.I don't dare to carry it for fear it will get out of order.""You ought to have a watch," said Mr."Then I could be sure to keep my business
appointments.Now I have to depend on the City Hall clock.I'd rather
look at it than carry it round.""Well, Dan, do you think Mr.He'll think you are going to buy some
clothes.I don't think he'll be very happy to see me.""He must see us both, or neither."Yes, sir--good enough for me.I don't think you would like to patronize
his establishment.""By the way, Dan, you have given me an order for money, and I have not
handed you the equivalent.""You may not get the money, sir.""I will make the effort at any rate.By the way, Dan, that coat of yours
is getting shabby.""It is the best I have, sir.Boys in my business don't have to dress
much."Please hand me my hat, and we will start."One or two of Dan's associates
whom they encountered on the way, were surprised to see him walking on
terms of apparent friendly companionship with a well-to-do stranger, but
decided that Dan was probably acting as his guide.Gripp standing as usual in the door-way of his shop
watching for customers.He did not at first observe Dan, but his
attention was drawn to Mr."Walk in, sir," he said, obsequiously."You will find what you want
here.Styles fashionable, and as for prices--we defy competition."Alexander Grant paused, and looked critically about him.He understood
very well the sort of establishment he was about to enter, and would not
have thought of doing so but in Dan's interests.He stepped over the threshold, and Dan was about to follow, when the
eagle eye of Mr."Don't you come round here
any more."Dan did not answer, for he knew Mr.Grant turned back, and said, quietly:

"To whom are you speaking, sir?""I beg your pardon, sir--it's that boy.""Then, sir, you will oblige me by stopping at once.That boy is in my
company and under my protection."Nathan Gripp stared as if transfixed.He was here
yesterday, and acted outrageously.He is in my company, and if I enter the
store he will.""Oh, of course, if he's with you he can come in.Samuel, show the
gentleman what he wants."Dan smiled, and nothing but a sense of his own interest prevented Mr.asked the callow young man named Samuel,
glaring at Dan in vivid remembrance of the blow which had doubled him
up."Have you any coats and vests that will fit this young gentleman?"repeated Samuel, mechanically, glancing at Dan in
silent hatred."That means me, Samuel," said Dan, mischievously."Samuel is an old
friend of mine, Mr."I think we can fit him," said Samuel, by no means relishing the task of
waiting upon his young opponent."Take off your coat, young feller.""I'll be ---- if I do," muttered the young man.Dan took off his coat, and tried on the one submitted to his inspection.He afterward tried on the vest, and they proved to be a good fit."Yes, sir, they fit as well as if they had been made for me.""What is the price of these articles, young man?""He'll take eight," suggested Dan, in a low voice.Grant knew well enough the ways of Chatham street merchants to
appreciate the suggestion."That is too high," he said, quietly.Samuel, who was trained to read customers, after a glance at Mr.Grant's
face, prepared to reduce the price."We might say eleven," he said, meditatively."You don't want us to give 'em away?"said Samuel, in the tone of one
whose reasonable demands had been objected to."There is no fear of that, I apprehend," returned Mr."I've no objection, I'm sure," remarked Dan, on his own account."I'd make a few remarks to you, young feller, if you were alone," he
read in the eyes of the indignant salesman, and Dan enjoyed the
restraint which he knew Samuel was putting upon himself."You are still asking too much," said the customer."The work didn't cost you much, I presume.""We pay the highest prices for work in this establishment, sir," said
Samuel, hastily."They pay twenty cents apiece for
making vests.""We pay more than that to our best hands," said Samuel."You told me you never paid more," retorted Dan."Young man," said he, "I will give you eight dollars for the clothes."As the regular price was eight dollars--when they couldn't get any
more--Samuel felt authorized to conclude the bargain without consulting
Mr."No," said Dan, "I'll wear 'em.Samuel felt it derogatory to his dignity to obey the orders of our hero,
but there was no alternative."Now write me a receipt for the price," said Mr."I have an order upon you for the balance," he said."I don't understand," ejaculated Samuel."Your principal owes my young friend, or his mother, one dollar and
twenty cents for work.This you will receive as part of the price.""We can't take the order, sir," he said."The boy's money is not yet
due.""Yes, sir; but it is our rule not to pay till a whole dozen is
delivered.""Then it is a rule which you must break," said Mr.Nathan Gripp did not like to lose the sale on the one hand, or abdicate
his position on the other."Tell your mother," he said to Dan, "that when she has finished another
half-dozen vests I will pay her the whole."He reflected that the stranger would be gone, and Dan would be in his
power."Thank you," said Dan, "but mother's agreed to work for Jackson."Then you'll have to wait for your pay," said Mr."Don't you care to sell this suit?""Yes, sir, but under the circumstances we must ask all cash.""Then I don't think we care to sell," said Gripp, allowing his anger to
overcome his interest.I think, Dan, we can find quite as good a bargain at
Jackson's.Gripp, do I understand that you decline to pay this
bill?""I will pay when the other half-dozen vests are made," said Gripp,
stubbornly.The bill is mine, and it is with me you
have to deal.Settle the bill now, or I shall
immediately put it in a lawyer's hands, who will know how to compel you
to pay it.""Take this gentleman's money, Samuel," said Gripp, in a tone of
annoyance.Dan walked out of the store better
dressed than he had been since the days of his prosperity."By continuing to care for your mother, my lad.You are lucky to have a
mother living.Now, my lad, what do you
think of my success in collecting bills?""You were too many for old Gripp, sir."He doesn't deserve to, for he grows rich by defrauding the poor who
work for him."Opposite the City Hall Park Dan and his friend separated."I shall not see you again, my boy," said Mr.Grant, "for I take the
evening train."That's a good man," said Dan, as he wended his way homeward."If there
were more such, it would be good for poor people like mother and me.If
I ever get rich, I mean to help along those that need it."MIKE RAFFERTY'S TRICK.Grant had lent him, and the
result was that for two months he was comparatively easy in his
circumstances.His mother earned five cents more daily, on account of
the higher price she received for work, and though this was a trifle, it
was by no means to be despised where the family income was so small as
in the case of the Mordaunts."Mother," said he, "I suppose I ought to be contented with earning
enough to pay our expenses, but I should like to be saving something.""Yes, Dan, it would be pleasant.But we ought to be thankful for what we
are now receiving.""But, mother, suppose I should fall sick?"Don't mention such a thing, Dan," she said."But it might happen, for all that.""Don't be frightened, mother," answered Dan, laughing."I'm as strong as
a horse, and can eat almost as much.Still, you know, we would feel
safer to have a little money in the savings-bank.""There isn't much chance of that, Dan, unless we earn more than we do
now."Well, I suppose there is no use thinking of it.By
the way, mother, you've got enough money on hand to pay the rent
to-morrow, haven't you?""Yes, Dan, and a dollar over."The door of the room was partly open, and the last part of the
conversation was heard by Mike Rafferty, the son of the tenant who
occupied the room just over the Mordaunts.He was a ne'er-do-well, who
had passed more than one term of imprisonment at Blackwell's Island.His
mother was an honest, hard-working washerwoman, who toiled early and
late to support herself and her three children.Mike might have given
her such assistance that she could have lived quite comfortably, for her
own earnings were by no means inconsiderable.Her wash-tub paid her much
more than Mrs.Mordaunts needle could possibly win, and she averaged a
dollar a day where her more refined neighbor made but twenty-five
cents.But Mike, instead of helping, was an additional burden.He got
his meals regularly at home, but contributed scarcely a dollar a month
to the common expenses.He was a selfish rowdy, who was likely to belong
permanently to the shiftless and dangerous classes of society.Mike had from time to time made approaches to intimacy with Dan, who was
nearly two years younger, but Dan despised him for his selfishly
burdening his mother with his support, and didn't encourage him.Naturally, Mike hated Dan, and pronounced him "stuck up" and proud,
though our hero associated familiarly with more than one boy ranking no
higher in the social scale than Mike Rafferty.Only the day before, Mike, finding himself out of funds, encountering
Dan on the stairs, asked for the loan of a quarter."I have no money to spare," answered Dan."You've got money, Dan; I saw you take out some a minute ago.""Yes, I've got the money, but I won't lend it.""You're a mane skinflint," said Mike, provoked."Because you've got the money, and you won't lend it.""What do you want to do with it?""I want to go to the Old Bowery to-night, if you must know.""If you wanted it for your mother I might have lent it to you, though I
need all I can earn for my own mother.""It's for my mother I want it, thin," said Mike."I guess I won't go to
the theater to-night."Your mother would never see the color of it.""Won't you lend me, thin?"If you want money, why don't you earn it, as I do?"If you go to work and sell papers or black boots, you
will be able to help your mother and pay your way to the theater
yourself.""Kape your advice to yourself," said Mike, sullenly."You'd rather have my money," said Dan, good-humoredly.I'll be _mane_, then.""I'd like to put a head on you," muttered Mike."Oh, you think you're mighty smart wid your jokes," said Mike.Dan smiled and walked off, leaving Mike more his enemy than ever.Mordaunt say that she had more than
the rent already saved up.He knew that it
must amount to several dollars, and this he felt would keep him in
cigarettes and pay for evenings at the theater for several days."I wish I had it," he said to himself."I wonder where the ould woman
kapes it."The more Mike thought of it the more he coveted this money, and he set
to work contriving means to get possession of it.About three o'clock in the afternoon he knocked at Mrs.It's bad news I bring you about Dan."she exclaimed, her heart
giving a great bound."He's been run over, ma'am, by a hoss, in front of the Astor House, and
they took him into the drug store at the corner."I guess he's broke his leg," said Mike.Mordaunt, trembling with apprehension, her faltering
limbs almost refusing to bear her weight, was on her way to the Astor
House.As Mike had calculated, she did not stop to lock the door.The young scape-grace entered the deserted room, rummaged about till he
found the scanty hoard reserved for the landlord, and then went off
whistling."Now I'll have a bully time," he said to himself."Didn't I fool the
ould woman good?"MIKE'S THEFT IS DISCOVERED.Dan was standing in front of the Astor House, talking to a boy
acquaintance, when his mother tottered up to him in a state of great
nervous agitation."Why, mother, what's the matter?"It occurred to him that his mother must
have lost her mind."Yes; they told me you were run over, and had your leg broken.""Then I wish I had him here," said Dan, indignantly; "I'd let him know
whether my leg is broken or not."Haven't you been run over, then?""Not that I know of, and I guess it couldn't be done without my knowing
it.""I don't know how I
got here, I was so agitated.""When did Mike Rafferty tell you this cock-and-bull story, mother?"He said you had been taken into a drug store,
and wanted me to come right over.""It's a mean trick he played on you, mother," said Dan, indignantly."I
don't see what made him do it.""He must have meant it as a joke.""I don't mind it now, Dan, since I have you safe.He didn't know how much he was distressing me."You may forgive him if you want to; I
sha'n't."I feel a good deal happier than I did when I
was hurrying over here."I have sold my papers, and sha'n't work any
more this afternoon.I hope I can come across
him soon.""I left him at the door of our room.""Did you lock the door when you came away, mother?""There isn't much to take, Dan," said Mrs."We shall be in a pretty pickle if that is lost.""You don't think Mike would take it do you, Dan?""I think he would if he knew where to find it.""I wish I had brought it with me," said Mrs.Mordaunt, in a tone of
anxiety."Don't fret, mother; I guess it's all right.""Perhaps you had better go home at once without waiting for me, Dan."In my pocket-book, in the drawer of the work-table."Well, I'll be off, and will meet
you at the room."Dan was not long in reaching his humble home.The more he thought of it,
the more he distrusted Mike, and feared that he might have had a
sinister design in the deception he had practiced upon his mother.To
lose the rent money would be a serious matter.Grab hated him, he
knew full well, and would show no mercy, while in the short time
remaining it would be quite impossible to make up the necessary sum.Dan sprang up the stairs, several at a bound, and made his way at once
to the little work-table.He pulled the drawer open without ceremony,
and in feverish haste rummaged about until, to his great joy, he found
the pocket-book."It's all right, after all," he said."Mike isn't so bad as I thought
him."He opened the pocket-book, and his countenance fell.There was a
twenty-five cent scrip in one of the compartments, and that was all."He's stolen the money, after all," he said, his heart sinking."What
are we going to do now?""That is all that is left," answered Dan, holding up the scrip."Mike could not be wicked enough to take it."You don't know him as I do, mother.He's a mean
thief, and he sent you off to have a clear field."I couldn't think of that, or anything else, Dan, when I thought you
were hurt."Grab will be angry when he finds we can't pay
him.""I will try to find Mike; and if I do, I will get the money if I can.Dan went up stairs at once, and knocked at Mrs.She came to the door, her arms dripping with suds, for she had been
washing."And how is your mother to-day?"asked Dan, abruptly, too impatient to answer the question."No; he went out quarter of an hour ago.""Did he tell you where he was going, Mrs.He said he was going over to Brooklyn to see if he could
get a job, shure.I'm sorry to tell you that Mike has played a
bad trick on my mother.""Oh, whirra, whirra, what a bye he is!""He's
always up to something bad.Sorra bit of worruk he does, and I at the
wash-tub all day long.""He's a bad son to you, Mrs.And what kind of trick has
he played on your good mother?""He told her that I had been run over and broken my leg.Of course she
went out to find me, thinking it was all true, and while she was away he
took the money from her pocket-book."Some mothers would have questioned this statement, but Mrs.Rafferty
knew to her cost that Mike was capable of stealing, having been
implicated in thefts on several occasions.I don't know what to do wid him, shure.""It was the money we were to pay our rent with to-morrow," continued
Dan."I wish I could make it up to you, Dan, dear.Rafferty, but you ought not to make it
up.Do you think he has really gone to
Brooklyn.""He might have done it as a blind, just to put me on the wrong scent."Rafferty, I can't stop any longer.He went down stairs and told his mother what he had discovered or failed
to discover."Don't wait supper for me, mother," he said."I'm going in search of
Mike.""You won't fight with him, Dan?"I am not
going to submit to the loss without trying to get the money back, you
may be sure of that."So Dan went down stairs, considerably perplexed in mind.Mike was sure
to keep out of the way for a time at least, anticipating that Dan would
be upon his track.While our hero was searching for him, he would have
plenty of opportunities of spending the money of which he had obtained
unlawful possession.To punish him without regaining the contents of the
lost pocket-book would be an empty triumph.In the street below Dan
espied Terence Quinn, an acquaintance of Mike."I saw him only a few minutes ago.""I'll tell you where he'll be this evening.""He's going to the Old Bowery, and I'm goin' wid him.""He didn't tell me," said Terence.I'm sure of it now," said Dan to himself."I
wish I knew where to find him."CHAPTER X.

DAN AS A DETECTIVE.Dan quickly decided that if Mike had been going to Brooklyn, he would
not have announced it under the circumstances."He meant to send me there on a wild-goose chase," he reflected."I am
not quite so green as he takes me to be."Dan could not decide as easily where Mike had gone.Hood says in his
poem of "The Lost Heir,"


     "A boy as is lost in London streets is like a needle in a bundle
       of hay."A hunt for a boy in the streets of New York is about equally hopeless."I'll just stroll round a little," he said to himself.Dan bent his steps toward the Courtlandt-street Ferry."Perhaps Mike has gone to Jersey City," he said to himself."Anyway,
I'll go over there."Six cents would defray Dan's expenses
both ways, and he was willing to incur this expense.He meant to look
about him, as something might turn up by which he could turn an honest
penny.Near him in the cabin of the ferry-boat sat a gentleman of middle age,
who seemed overloaded with baggage.He had two heavy carpet-bags, a
satchel, and a bundle, at which he looked from time to time with a
nervous and uncomfortable glance.When the boat touched shore he tried
to gather his various pieces of luggage, but with indifferent success.Noticing his look of perplexity, Dan approached him, and said,
respectfully:

"Can't I assist you, sir?""I wish you would, my boy," said the gentleman, relieved.I'll take one of the carpet-bags and the satchel, if
you like.""Do you know the wharf of the Cunard steamers?""Not more than five or six minutes' walk," answered Dan."Can you help me as far as that with my luggage?""I will make it worth your while, and you will be doing me a great favor
besides.I was brought down to the ferry, but the rascally hackman
demanded five dollars more to carry me across and land me at the Cunard
pier.He thought I would have to submit to this imposition, but I was so
indignant that I tried to handle all my luggage myself.I don't know how
I should have managed without you.""I won't charge you so much, sir," said Dan, smiling."It isn't for the money I cared so much as for the imposition.I would
rather pay you ten dollars than the hackman five.""Be careful, sir," said Dan, smiling, "or I may take advantage of your
liberal offer.""You don't look like a boy that would take advantage of a traveler.""You can't judge from appearances, sir.I have been robbed of six
dollars to-day, and I might try to make it up that way.""Was it all the money your mother had?""How did you happen to be coming across the ferry?"By this time they were in sight of the Cunard wharf."Were you ever on a Cunard steamer?""Help me on board with my luggage, and I will show you about.""I thought the steamers generally left in the morning," said Dan."So they do; but to-day the tide did not serve till later."Stevens down below with his luggage, and assisted him in
storing them in his stateroom.He surveyed with interest the cabin, the
deck, the dining-saloon, and the various arrangements."Well," said the gentleman, smiling, "how do you like it?""Do you think you would like to be going with me?""Yes, sir, but for my mother.""Of course, it won't do to desert her; otherwise I might be tempted to
make you an offer.I am sure you would be very useful to me.""I should like it very much, if mother did not need me."Stevens, and remained till visitors were
warned that it was time to go ashore."I must go, sir," he said.Stevens drew a five-dollar bill from his vest pocket and handed it
to Dan."I haven't any change, sir," said Dan."None is required," said the gentleman, smiling."Do you really mean to give me five dollars, sir?""That is what the hackman wanted to charge me.""It was too much for him; it is not too much for you, if I am willing to
give it to you.""You are very kind, sir," said Dan, almost doubting the reality of his
good fortune."It will prove that I spoke truly when I said I didn't care for the
amount of money, only for the imposition.I am really very glad to give
it to you.Dan shook it heartily, and, wishing him a pleasant
voyage, descended the gangplank."That is almost as much as Mike robbed me of," he said to himself."How
lucky I came over to Jersey City!Now, if I could only get back part of
the money Mike robbed me of, I should be the better off for his mean
trick."He had been so fortunate
that he decided to spend the rest of the afternoon as he liked.He walked on for ten minutes, Mike being temporarily out of his mind,
when his attention was suddenly drawn to him.Just in front of him he
saw Mike himself swaggering along, with a ten-cent cigar in his mouth,
and both hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets.He was strolling
along in fancied security, not dreaming of the near presence of the boy
whom he had so meanly robbed.Dan's eyes sparkled when he recognized his enemy, and hastening his
pace, he put his hand on Mike's shoulder.Mike turned quickly, and his countenance changed when he saw Dan."Anyway, he
can't prove anything."What brings _you_ over here, Mike?""I'm looking for a job," said Mike."You look like it," retorted Dan, "with both hands in your pockets and
a cigar in your mouth!"I don't know," answered Mike, with unblushing falsehood."A man gave it
to me for holdin' his hoss."Mike was never at a loss for a plausible lie."Did they let you over the ferry free, then?""Oh, I had money enough for that.""Then how are you going to take Terence Quinn to the theater to-night?"Even Mike's brazen effrontery was hardly prepared to meet this
unexpected question."Terence told me you had invited him."said Mike, his self-assurance returning."Look here, Mike Rafferty," said Dan, out of patience; "that won't go
down!I know where you got the money you were
going to treat him with.""It's the truth, and if you don't hand over what's left without making
any more trouble, I'll have you arrested."We're in Jersey----"

"I shall have you arrested as soon as you get home.""I didn't take the money," said Mike, sullenly."You did, and you know it," said Dan, firmly."Give me what you have
left, and I'll make no trouble about it.If you don't, you're booked for
another term at the island."Mike tried to save his ill-gotten gains, but Dan was persistent, and
finally extracted from him four dollars and a half.The rest Mike
pretended he had spent.He was sly enough, however, to have saved enough
to take him to the Old Bowery.On the whole, Dan was satisfied, considering the five dollars he had
received on the Cunard steamer, but he could not forbear giving Mike a
farewell shot."How did it happen, Mike, that you took the Jersey Ferry to Brooklyn?""That is my first appearance as a detective," thought Dan.It was only five o'clock when Dan, returning from Jersey City, found
himself again in front of the Astor House.I've
made enough to satisfy me for one day."Dan stood at the corner of Vesey street, glancing at the hurrying
crowds.He rather enjoyed his temporary freedom from business cares.He had made a good day's work, the morrow's rent was provided for, and
he felt like a gentleman of leisure.All at once his attention was drawn to a low sob.It proceeded from a
little flower-girl of ten years, who usually stood near the hotel.asked Dan, calling her by her name, for the
little flower-girl was one of his acquaintances."Haven't you sold as
many bouquets as usual?""Yes," said Fanny, pausing in her sobs, "I've sold more.""No, but a young man passed a bad half-dollar on me."He did not need to ring it, for it was dull in
appearance and unmistakably bad.A young man came up and bought a five-cent bouquet, and gave
me this to change.""Didn't you see that it was bad?""I didn't look at it till afterward."So you gave him forty-five cents in good money, Fanny?""Yes," said the little girl, again beginning to sob."How many bouquets had you sold?""Then you have less money than when you began?""Do you think the fellow knew the piece was bad?""No, I saw him turn down Fulton street.""Give me the bad piece, and I'll go after him.Dan seized the money, and proceeded toward Fulton Ferry at a half run."I hope he won't have taken the boat," he said to himself."If he has I
shall lose him."Dan nearly overthrew an apple woman's stand not far from the ferry, but
did not stop to apologize.He ran into a fat gentleman who looked
daggers at him, but kept on.Breathless he paid his ferriage, and just succeeded in catching a boat
as it was leaving the New York pier.Thus far he had not seen the young man of whom he was in search.I'll go forward," said Dan to himself.He walked through the ladies' cabin, and stepped out on the forward
deck.The boat was crowded, for it was at the time when men who live in
Brooklyn, but are employed in New York, are returning to their homes.Dan looked about him for a time without success, but all at once his
eyes lighted up.Just across the deck, near the door of the gentlemen's
cabin, stood a young man with red hair, holding a small bouquet in his
hand.His face was freckled, his eyes small, and he looked capable of
meanness.Of course appearances are often deceptive, but not unfrequently a man's
character can be read upon his face."That's the fellow that cheated poor Fanny, I'll bet a hat," Dan decided
within himself.He immediately crossed to the other side of the deck.The red-headed young man was talking to another young man of about the
same age."Where did you get that bouquet, Sanderson?""Bought it of a little girl in front of the Astor House," answered
Sanderson."I suppose it is meant for some young lady," suggested the other."Maybe it is," answered Sanderson, with a grin.Dan thought it was about time to come to business.He touched the red-haired young man on the arm."You bought that bouquet of a girl near the Astor House," said Dan.asked Sanderson, uneasily, for he had a suspicion of
what was coming."You gave her a bogus half-dollar in payment," continued Dan."I am sorry I cannot accommodate you," said Dan, "but I want you to give
me a good piece for this first.""I never saw that half-dollar before," said Sanderson."Perhaps you can prove that before the court," said Dan."I mean that you have passed counterfeit money, and unless you give me a
good piece for it I will give you in charge as soon as we reach the
pier," said Dan, firmly.Sanderson looked about him, and saw that the boy's charge was believed."Fanny is a poor girl," he said."I found her crying over her loss, for
it was more than all the money she had taken to-day.""Yes, I am," said Dan, stoutly."This is a put-up job between you two," said Sanderson."Gentlemen," said Dan, turning and appealing to the passengers near him,
"this young man has passed a bad fifty-cent piece on a poor flower-girl.exclaimed half a dozen, and several cried "shame!"with
looks of scorn and disgust directed toward the young man with red hair."I don't believe a word of it," he ejaculated, in a rage."But I'll give you the money to get rid of you," and he threw a
half-dollar at Dan with a look very far from amiable."Thank you, sir; here's your money," said Dan.Though Sanderson had disclaimed all knowledge of the bogus half-dollar,
he took it and put it carefully in his pocket."Keep it to pay your washerwoman with," said a jeering voice.It was a young fellow in the garb of a workman who spoke.The boat touched the pier, and Sanderson was only too glad to hurry away
from the unfriendly crowd.cried a keen-looking businessman, addressing Dan."How did you discover that this fellow was the one that passed the
coin."He placed in Dan's hands a card bearing the firm's name


     BARTON & ROGERS,
     Commission Merchants,
               No.Dan was so pleased at having recovered Fanny's money that he gave
little thought to this last incident, though it was destined to exert an
important influence on his fortunes.He took the same boat back to New
York, and hurried to the Astor House.Little Fanny, the flower-girl, with a sad look upon her face, was still
standing in her wonted place."I've got your money back, Fanny," said Dan."Yes; I made the fellow give it up.""Oh, how kind you are, Dan!"There was a listener to what passed between the two children.A tall
lady, standing at the corner of the street, regarded them attentively.She was evidently revolving some plan in her head.As Dan was about
turning away, she placed her hand on his arm."Young man," she said, "I want to speak to you.""All right, ma'am," said Dan, surprised.Dan thought it probable that the lady who accosted him might wish to
send him on an errand, and his surprise vanished.She was tall, slender,
and grave in appearance."Are you an only child, or have you brothers and sisters?""There is only one of me," answered Dan, humorously."If I were not, I would not sell papers for a living.""Yes," answered Dan, beginning to be tired of satisfying what might be
only curiosity on the part of the lady.She noticed at once the change
in his manner."I am not making these inquiries out of curiosity," she said, quickly."I have an object in what I ask.""All right, ma'am," he said; "I am ready to answer.""Are you at leisure for an hour or two?""I suppose mother will be worried if I don't come home to supper," he
said, hesitating."Can't you send her a message not to expect you?Does this little girl
know where you live?""Little girl," she said, "go at once and tell this boy's mother that he
will not be home till nine o'clock.The little girl's eyes sparkled with joy as the lady placed fifty cents
in her hand.As for Dan, he was puzzled to conjecture what the lady could want of
him.What would justify such a handsome compensation to Fanny merely to
explain his absence to his mother?"Now," said the lady, "if you will hail the next stage we will go up
town."Soon they were rattling over the pavements
through thronged Broadway.It was two years since Dan had been in a
Broadway stage.He could not afford to pay ten cents for a ride, but
when it was absolutely necessary rode in a horse-car for half price.Dan looked about him to see if he knew any one in the stage.Nearly
opposite sat his former schoolmate, Tom Carver, with a young lady at his
side.Their glances met, and Dan saw Tom's lip curl with scorn.Of
course he did not betray any mark of recognition."I like riding in a Broadway stage," he heard the young lady say."There
is more to see as you go along."Not always," said Tom, with a significant glance at Dan.Dan felt indignant, but was too proud to show it."The price excludes the lower classes from using the stage," said the
young lady."It ought to, but I have seen a newsboy in a stage.""How can they afford to pay ten cents for riding?""I give it up," said Tom, shrugging his shoulders.The lady who was with Dan noticed the direction of Tom Carver's look."Yes," answered Dan, "I used to know him.""I don't," said Dan, promptly, returning Tom Carver's stare.Tom could not help hearing this conversation, and learned for the first
time that Dan and the handsomely dressed lady beside him were in
company."What can they have to do with each other?""She can't be a relation--she is too handsomely dressed."At this moment the young lady beside him dropped her handkerchief.Before Tom could stoop to pick it up Dan had handed it to her with a
polite bow."Thank you," said the young lady, with a pleasant smile."You needn't have troubled yourself," said Tom Carver, irritated."This
young lady is under _my_ charge.""It is no trouble, I assure you," answered Dan."He is very polite," said the young lady, in a low voice, "and very
good-looking, too," she added, with a second look at Dan."He is only a common newsboy," said Tom, not relishing Julia Grey's
tribute to a boy he disliked."I can't help what he is," said the young lady, independently; "he looks
like a gentleman."Dan could not help catching the drift of their conversation, and his
face flushed with pleasure, for Julia was a very pretty girl, but not
being addressed to him, he could not take notice of it otherwise."He lives at the Five Points somewhere," muttered Tom.The young lady seemed rather amused at Tom's discomposure, and only
smiled in reply.The stage kept on till it reached Madison square."Will you pull the strap opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel?"He got out first, and helped his companion out."Follow me into the hotel," she said.asked the lady, as they ascended the stairs."I needn't ask if you have a good mother?""One of the best," said Dan, promptly."You look like a well-bred boy, and I infer that your mother is a lady.Dan followed her, wondering, and she signed to him to take a seat on the
sofa beside her."You have already told me that you have no sister," she began."Do you think your mother would enjoy the society of a little girl?""I have a little girl under my charge--my niece--from whom, for reasons
unnecessary to state, I am obliged to part for a time.Do you think your
mother would be willing to take charge of her?Of course I would make it
worth her while.""I am sure she would like it," said Dan, for he saw at a glance that
this would be a very desirable arrangement for them."Then you feel authorized to accept the charge in your mother's name?"Your mother would be willing to
teach her until such time as she may be old enough to go to school?""I think little girls are best off at home until the age of seven or
eight.""We live in a poor room and a poor neighborhood."I shall pay you enough to enable you to
take better rooms.""I may as well be explicit," said the lady."I propose to pay fifty
dollars a month for my ward's board, including, of course, your mothers
care.""I am afraid it won't be worth it," said Dan, frankly."If Althea is well cared for, as I am sure she will be, I shall have no
fear of that.Let me add that I shall allow your mother ten dollars per
month extra for the child's clothing--say sixty dollars in all.For the
present that will probably be enough.""Oh, yes, I should think so," said Dan."When do you want her to come to
us?"I must leave New York early to-morrow.In fact, I leave
the city by an early train.""She would have to come to our poor lodgings," said Dan, hesitatingly.To-morrow you can secure rooms up town.""Yes, ma'am, I will."Now," said the lady, rising, "since the matter is settled, come up
stairs with me, and I will show you the child."Dan followed the lady up stairs, feeling as if he were in a dream, but a
very pleasant one.As the lady entered the room a little girl, with an expression of joy,
ran from the window from which she had been looking, and took her hand."I'm so glad you've got home, auntie," she said."I staid away longer than I intended, Althea," said the lady."I was
afraid you would feel lonely."I wanted to go out into the hall and play with a
little girl that lives in the next room, but I thought you wouldn't find
me."I have brought you a playfellow, Althea."This drew the little girl's attention to Dan.Unlike most girls of her
age, she was not bashful.Are you going to live with us, Dan?""You are coming to live with me," said Dan, smiling.You are nice-looking," said Althea, in a
matter-of-fact tone.He found the compliment agreeable, though it came from a
little girl."So are you, Althea," he said."I don't think I am," said Althea."I've black hair, and my skin is
dark.You have nice brown hair, and are whiter than I am.""Some like dark people best," suggested Dan.I asked auntie to buy me a big cake of soap to wash the brown
off, but it wouldn't come."He thought the bright, vivacious little face, with the
brilliant dark eyes, pretty, though Althea did not."You will like to live with Dan, my dear?""I have got to go away--on business.""I don't want you to go away, auntie," she said."Dan and I can't live
alone.""Dan has a mother, who will be very good to you."asked Althea, brightening up."And you will come to see me some time, auntie?""Then I will go with Dan;" and the little girl placed her hand
confidingly in that of our hero.Dan thought it would be pleasant for him to have a little sister, and he
knew that it would brighten his mother's existence."Shall we go now, madam?"She drew from her pocket a wallet
containing a considerable sum of money."I will hand you two months' payment in advance," she said, "and
afterward I will remit you monthly, or direct you where to call for
money.Two months at fifty dollars will amount to one hundred, and
twenty more for Althea's dress will make it up to a hundred and twenty."Whenever I have any to be careful about," answered Dan."I hope you will be comfortably provided from this time.There is a
little trunk of Althea's clothes in the trunk-room below.I will write
you an order for it, but you may as well wait till you have moved before
carrying it away."Then you shall go into supper with Althea and myself.""I'm afraid I don't look fit."At any rate, it's nobody's business.There was nothing to say, so Dan followed the mysterious lady into the
supper-room, Althea clinging to his hand.He felt awkward as he took his
seat.Suppose some one should recognize him as the newsboy who usually
stood in front of the Astor House!The young lady whom Tom Carver was escorting boarded at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, and had alighted at the same time with our hero, though he did
not observe it.Tom had been invited to supper, and, with Julia and her father, was
seated at a neighboring table when Dan entered.Tom could hardly credit his eyes when he saw Dan entering the
supper-room, with the little girl clinging to his hand.he ejaculated, forgetting his manners in his
surprise."I beg your pardon, but I was so astonished.There is that newsboy
coming into supper!""What a pretty little girl is with him!""You must be mistaken about your friend being a newsboy.""Your acquaintance, then; though he is nice enough looking to be a
friend.I saw him selling papers yesterday in front of the Astor
House.""His business must be good, or he would not board at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel.""Of that boy at the next table, pa."Why, that's my young friend of the ferry-boat.Tom, have the
kindness to ask him to come here a moment and speak to me."Much surprised, and considerably against his will, Tom rose and walked
over to where Dan was sitting."Look here," said he; "come over to the next table, will you?""There's a gentleman wants to speak to you."Rogers, of the firm of Barton &
Rogers, who had asked him to call at his place of business on Pearl
street."Not as a rule," answered Dan, smiling."Then, Dan, let me make you acquainted with my daughter, Julia.""I think you were sitting opposite me in the stage, Mr."You were polite enough to hand me my handkerchief when I awkwardly
dropped it.""Dan, this young gentleman is Thomas Carver.Carver a long time," said Dan, smiling."You didn't tell me that, Tom," said Julia Rogers, turning to Tom."No," said Tom, embarrassed; "it is a good while ago.""I won't detain you any longer from your friends," said Mr."I shall see you at the office in the morning.""Where did you meet him, papa?"Her father told the story of Dan's exploit on the ferry-boat."He is a very smart boy," he said."I shall probably take him into my
employ."All this was very disagreeable to Tom Carver, but he did not venture to
say all that he felt, being somewhat in awe of Mr."They are making a great fuss over a common newsboy," he muttered to
himself.After supper, Dan prepared to take Althea home with him.She felt so
well acquainted already that she made no objection, but, hand-in-hand,
left the hotel with Dan.He halted a Broadway stage, and they got in."Are you carrying me to where you live, Dan?""Will your mother be glad to see me?"She wants a little girl to keep her
company."Mordaunt was apprised by Fanny that Dan had gone up town with a
lady, and therefore was not alarmed when he did not return home at the
usual time.She hoped he would clear fifty cents, but had no idea to
what extent their fortunes would be advanced by Dan's evening's work."I will save Dan some supper," she said to herself.So, mother-like, she supped economically herself, on a cup of tea and
some dry bread, and bought a bit of steak for Dan's supper, for she
thought he would be very hungry at so late an hour.It was nearly half-past eight when she heard Dan's well known step on
the stairs.She opened the door to welcome him, but the cheerful welcome upon her
lips died away in surprise when she saw his companion."She is going to be my little sister, mother," said Dan, gayly.said Althea, releasing Dan's hand, and putting
her own confidingly in that of Mrs."Yes, my dear," said the widow, her heart quite won by the little girl's
innocent confidence, and she bent over and kissed her."It means that Althea is to board with us, and be company for you.I
have agreed with her aunt that you will take her.""But does her aunt know that we live in such a poor place?"asked his
mother in a tone of hesitation."Yes, mother, but that makes no difference, as we shall move up town
to-morrow.""I am sure you have acted for the best, Dan, but it seems so strange.""Will it seem strange to receive fifty dollars a month for Althea's
board?"I didn't suppose we ought to charge more."Are you a great eater,
Althea?""Sometimes I am," said the little girl, naively."Never mind, I guess there will be enough."I didn't know there
would be two, but I will go cut and buy some more meat, if you can
wait.""I have had supper, mother, or dinner rather.I dined with Althea and
her aunt at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.""Has Althea been stopping there, Dan?""Then how can she stay even one night in this poor place?"Althea, do you mind stopping here just one night?We
will go to a better place to-morrow.""No, Dan, I don't care.""There, mother, I told you so, Althea is a brick.""What a funny boy you are, Dan!A brick is red and
ugly, and I am not.""No, Althea, you are not ugly, but your cheeks are red.""They don't look like a brick, Dan.""I had got your supper all ready, Dan," said his mother, regretfully."You didn't have any meat, I'll warrant.Now, like a good mother, sit
down and eat the steak."Assured that Dan had supped well, Mrs.Mordaunt didn't resist his
advice.Dan looked on, and saw with pleasure that his mother relished the meat."We will be able to live better hereafter, mother," he said."There
won't be any stinting.Fifty dollars will go a good ways, and then,
besides, there will be my earnings.I forgot to tell you, mother, that I
have probably got a place.""Our good fortune is coming all at once, Dan," said Mrs.I think it has come to stay, too.""I feel so tired," said Althea, at this point.In twenty minutes the little girl was in a sound sleep.Dan was not
sorry, for he wanted to tell his mother about the days adventures, and
he could do so more freely without any one to listen."So, mother," he concluded, "we are going to turn over a new leaf.We
can't go back to our old style of living just yet, but we can get out of
this tenement-house, and live in a respectable neighborhood.""God has been good to us, Dan."I know it, mother, but somehow I don't think of that as quick as you.Who do you think I saw in the supper-room at the Fifth Avenue?He was wonderfully puzzled to know how I happened to be
there.He told the party he was with that I was a common newsboy.""He is a very mean boy," said Mrs."After being
so intimate with you too."He can't do me any harm, and I don't care for his
friendship.The time may come when I can meet him on even terms."I shall work along, and if I get rich I
sha'n't be the first rich man that has risen from the ranks."Early the next morning Dan started out in search of a new home.He and his mother decided that they would like to live somewhere near
Union Square, as that would be a pleasant afternoon resort for their
young boarder."No, Dan, I have not time this morning."Very well, mother; I will do my best."Dan crossed Broadway, and took a horse-car up town.In West Sixteenth street his attention was drawn to the notice,
"Furnished Rooms to Let," upon a good-looking brick house.He rang the bell, and asked to see the lady of the house.A stout, matronly looking woman, with a pleasant face, answered the
servant's call."I called to inquire for rooms," said Dan."For my mother, and sister, and myself.""I have a large back room on the third floor, and a small room on the
fourth floor."It was neatly carpeted and furnished, and had a cheerful outlook."This will do for mother and Althea," he said."Yes, ma'am, but I am sure that will suit.It is for me, and I am not
particular.But there's one thing that may trouble us.""I will give her the privilege of using my kitchen.I don't care to
take boarders, as it would be too much care, but your mother is welcome
to use my kitchen stove.""Leave that to your mother and myself," said Mrs."How much do you want for your rooms?""Of course; that is all I ask."We will pay it," said Dan, quite relieved, for he feared he should have
to pay more."I generally ask a week's rent in advance," said Mrs.Brown, "but in
your case I won't insist upon it.""Oh, it is perfectly convenient," said Dan, and he drew out his
pocket-book containing the money--over a hundred dollars--which Althea's
aunt had given him.Brown's respect for Dan was considerably increased by this display
of wealth, and she congratulated herself on securing such substantial
lodgers.This business accomplished Dan went down town, and informed his mother
of the arrangement he had made.Mordaunt, Althea, and
he were installed in their new home, much to the regret of Mrs.Rafferty, who regretted losing so good a neighbor.Before this, however,
Dan sought the counting-room of Barton & Rogers.DAN BECOMES A DETECTIVE.Barton & Rogers evidently did business in a large way.They occupied an
imposing-looking building of five stories, the greater part being used
to store goods.A spare,
dark-complexioned man of about thirty-five, with a pen behind his ear,
was issuing orders to a couple of workmen."No, he is not," said the dark man, curtly."You might be more civil," thought our hero.He stood his ground, feeling authorized to do so because he had come by
appointment.Observing this, the book-keeper turned and said, sharply:

"Didn't you hear?"I heard you," said Dan, quietly."Not at all, sir; but Mr."Thank you, but I don't think that would do."The book-keeper eyed him sharply, and his face lighted up with a sudden
discovery."You sell papers in front of the Astor House,
don't you?""I thought so; I have bought papers of you."Rogers wants me, I suppose, or he would not have asked me to call,"
returned Dan."Not always," said Dan, with a smile."Some hot days I am far from
cool."Rogers wishes you to supply him with an evening paper?""Perhaps he does," returned Dan, with a smile."In the supper-room of the Fifth Avenue Hotel."demanded Talbot, the book-keeper, in
surprise."I was taking supper," said Dan, rather enjoying the others surprise,
"and Mr.Do you often take supper at the Fifth Avenue Hotel?""I'm willing to change places with you."you are here before me, Dan," he remarked, pleasantly."No, sir; only about five minutes.""I must keep you waiting a few minutes longer while I look at my
letters.The letters have arrived, have they not, Mr."Amuse yourself as you like while you are waiting, Dan," said the
merchant.Talbot, the book-keeper, followed the merchant into the
counting-room, and Dan was left alone.He looked about him with
interest, thinking it probable that this was to be his future business
home.It would certainly be a piece of good fortune to become attached
to so large and important a house, and he felt in very good spirits,
though he foresaw that Mr.Talbot would not make it very pleasant for
him.But with his employer on his side he need not be alarmed."I have to go out a few minutes," he said to Dan."Come with me, and we
can talk on the way."Talbot followed the two with a frown upon his brow."How on earth has that boy managed to get round Mr."I hope he won't be foolish enough to take him in here."Talbot had a nephew whom he was anxious to get into the business, and
Dan's engagement would interfere with his little plan.This partly
accounts for his brusque reception of Dan on his first arrival."Well, how do you like our place of business, Dan?""Would you rather sell papers or take employment with me?""I should like very much to be in your employ, sir.""How much did you earn as a newsboy?""When I was lucky I made a dollar a day.""Then I ought to give you six dollars a week."It is more than boys generally get at the
start, but I am willing to pay a good sum to a boy who suits me.""I will try to suit you, sir.""Do you know why I take you into my employ?""I feel kindly disposed to you, Dan, but that is not my chief reason."Dan was puzzled, and waited to hear more."My attention was drawn to you on the ferry-boat.I observed your
detection of the mean scamp who cheated a poor flower-girl by offering
her bad money, and I inferred that you were sharp and keen.""That is the sort of boy I want just now."I don't think he admires me much," he answered."He wanted to clear me
out before you came in.""Yes; he recognized me as a newsboy."He has a nephew whom he wishes me to
engage."Perhaps his nephew would suit you better, sir," said Dan, modestly."Are you willing to resign in his favor?""I prefer to leave that to you, sir."The nephew is a disagreeable boy, who would not
suit me at all.He thinks more of dress than of duty, and, if I read him
aright, is lazy and incompetent.Talbot has spoken to
me about taking him.""Perhaps he doesn't know his nephew's faults.""He knows them well enough, but is desirous of promoting his interests.He won't look upon you very favorably when he learns that I have engaged
you.""If you are satisfied, I won't care for that."And now for a few words in confidence," and Mr."Our business is a large one, and the sums of
money handled are necessarily large.Three months since I ascertained
that somewhere in my establishment there was a leak.We are losing money
in some unexplained way.I believe that some one in whom I repose
confidence is betraying me."Talbot," he said, in the same low voice."It seems strange, perhaps, that I should speak so confidentially to
you--a mere boy--but I am impressed with the idea that you can help me.""If I can, sir, I will," said Dan, earnestly.My first injunction is to say no word, even to your
nearest relations, of what I have told you."I want to know what are his habits,
whether he uses money freely, with whom he associates.Can you, without
betraying to him that he is watched, find out some information for me on
these points?""If you secure any information, never communicate it to me in the
office.Either come to my house, or write me there.""You understand that I am employing you in a detective capacity, and
that your time will partly be taken up out of business hours.I intend
to pay you extra, according to results.Rogers, but I am afraid you will be disappointed in
me.""Have you any directions to give me, sir, as to how to go to work?""No; I am nothing of a detective myself.I might,
of course, employ a professional detective, but Talbot is sharp, and he
would suspect.He won't dream of my employing a
boy.That is all I have to say for the present."To-morrow let it be, then.Rogers shook hands with our hero, and walked away."I am afraid I have a hard job on my hands," thought Dan, "but I will do
my best."DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's mother was much pleased with her new quarters.The large room,
occupied by Althea and herself, was bright and cheerful, and well
furnished.Besides the ordinary chamber furniture, there was a
comfortable arm-chair and a lounge.Mordaunt felt that she would
not be ashamed now to receive a visit from some of her former friends.She had anticipated some trouble about the preparation of meals, but
Mrs.Brown made a proposition which wonderfully removed all
difficulties.Mordaunt," she said, "your family is about the same as mine.I
have a son who is employed in a newspaper office down town, and you have
two young children.Now, suppose we club together, and each pay half of
the table supplies.Then one day you can superintend the cooking--you
will only have to direct my servant Maggie--and the next day I will do
it.Then, every other day, each of us will be a lady of leisure, and not
have to go into the kitchen at all."The arrangement will be so much to my advantage that I can say only
one thing--I accept with thanks.But won't you be doing more than your
share?You will be furnishing the fuel, and pay Maggie's wages.""I should have to do that at any rate.The plan is perfectly
satisfactory to me, if it suits you."Mordaunt found that the expense was not beyond her means.Her
income for the care of Althea was fifty dollars a month, and Dan paid
her four dollars a week out of his wages, reserving the balance as a
fund to purchase clothes.She went herself to market and selected
articles for the table, and, for the first time since her husband's
failure, found herself in easy circumstances.There was no need now to make vests at starvation prices.She had
thought of continuing, but Dan insisted upon her giving it up entirely."If you want to sew, mother," he said, "you can make some of Althea's
clothes, and pay yourself out of the ten dollars a month allowed for her
clothes."Mordaunt decided to follow Dan's
advice.She lost no time in obtaining books for the little girl, and
commencing her education.Althea knew her letters, but nothing more.She
was bright and eager to learn, and gained rapidly under her new teacher.Naturally, Dan and his mother were curious as to Althea's early
history, but from the little girl they obtained little information."Do you remember your mother, Althea?"Only a little while before you brought me here.""Your mother isn't dead, is she?"Poor mamma cried very much
when she went away.She kissed me, and called me her darling.""Perhaps her lungs are affected, and she has gone to a warmer climate,"
suggested Mrs."She may have gone to Florida, or even to
Italy."asked Dan, turning to Althea."Father is a bad man," said the child, positively."He came back once, and then mamma cried again.I think he wanted mamma
to give him some money."Dan and his mother talked over the little girl's revelations, and
thought they had obtained a clew to the mystery in which the child's
history was involved.Althea's mother might have married a man of bad
habits, who wanted to get possession of her fortune, and rendered a
separation necessary.Ill health might have required her to leave home
and shift the care of the little girl upon strangers.It seemed rather
odd that she should have been handed over to utter strangers, but there
might have been reasons of which they knew nothing."We won't trouble ourselves about it," said Dan."It's good luck for us,
even if it was bad luck for Althea's mother.I like the idea of having a
little sister."Althea's last name was not known to her new protector.When Dan
inquired, he was told that she could pass by his name, so Althea
Mordaunt she became.Both Dan and his mother had feared that she might become homesick, but
the fear seemed groundless.She was of a happy disposition, and almost
immediately began to call Mrs."I call you mother," she said, "but I have a mamma besides; but she has
gone away.""You must not forget your mamma, my dear," said the widow.She will come back some day; she said she would.""And I will take care of you till she does, Althea.""I am glad I came to you, for now I have
a brother Dan.""And I have a little sister," said Dan.While Dan was away, and now he was away after supper regularly, Althea
was a great deal of company for Mrs.In the pleasant afternoons she took the little girl out to walk,
frequently to Union Square Park, where she made acquaintance with other
little girls, and had a merry time, while her new mother sat on one of
the benches.One day a dark-complexioned gentleman, who had been looking earnestly at
Althea, addressed Mrs."That is a fine little girl of yours, madam," he said."She does not resemble you much," he said, inquiringly."No; there is very little resemblance," answered Mrs.Mordaunt, quietly,
feeling that she must be on her guard.Mordaunt did not reply, and the stranger thought she was offended."I beg your pardon," he said, "but she resembles a friend of mine, and
that called my attention to her."Mordaunt bowed, but thought it wisest not to protract the
conversation.She feared that the inquirer might be a friend of the
father, and hostile to the true interests of the child.For a week to come she did not again bring Althea to the park, but
walked with her in a different direction.When, after a week, she
returned to the square, the stranger had disappeared.At all events, he
was not to be seen.Talbot heard of his engagement with anything but satisfaction.He
even ventured to remonstrate with Mr."Do you know that this boy whom you have engaged is a common newsboy?""I have bought a paper more than once of him, in front of the
Astor House.""It is none of my business, but I think you could easily get a better
boy.There is my nephew----"

"Your nephew would not suit me, Mr."Won't you give him a trial?""If Dan should prove unsatisfactory, would you try my nephew?"It was an incautious concession, for it was an inducement to the
book-keeper to get Dan into trouble.It was Dan's duty to go to the post-office, sometimes to go on errands,
and to make himself generally useful about the warehouses.As we know,
however, he had other duties of a more important character, of which Mr.The first discovery Dan made was made through the book-keeper's
carelessness.Rogers was absent in Philadelphia, when Talbot received a note which
evidently disturbed him.Dan saw him knitting his brows, and looking
moody.Finally he hastily wrote a note, and called Dan."Take that to -- Wall street," he said, "and don't loiter on the way."On reaching the address, Dan found that Jones & Robinson were stock
brokers."Tell him we will carry the stocks for him a week longer, but can't
exceed that time.""Perhaps you had better write him a note," suggested Dan, "as he may not
like to have me know his business.""I believe I have made a discovery," he said to himself.Talbot is
speculating in Wall street.I wonder if he speculates with his own money
or the firm's?"His face, however, betrayed nothing as he handed the note to the
book-keeper, and the latter, after a searching glance, decided that
there was nothing to fear in that quarter.Talbot's operations, if the reader
will accompany him to a brownstone house on Lexington avenue, on the
evening of the day when Dan was sent to the office of the Wall street
brokers.Talbot ascended the steps, not with the elastic step of a man with
whom the world is prospering, but with the slow step of a man who is
burdened with care.he inquired of the servant who answered the
bell."Will you tell her I should like to speak with her?"Talbot walked in with the air of one who was familiar with the house,
and entering a small front room, took a seat.The furniture was plain, and the general appearance was that of a
boarding-house.Talbot seemed immersed in thought, and only raised his eyes from the
carpet when he heard the entrance of a young lady.His face lighted up,
and he rose eagerly."My dear Virginia," he said, "it seems a long time since I saw you.""It is only four days," returned the young lady, coolly."Four days without seeing you is an eternity."It was easy to see that Talbot was in love, and
she was not."Not good news," said he, soberly.Before going further, it may be as well to describe briefly the young
lady who had so enthralled the book-keeper.She had the advantage of youth, a complexion clear red and white, and
decidedly pretty features.If there was a defect, it was the expression
of her eyes.There was nothing soft or winning in her glance.She
seemed, and was, of a cold, calculating, unsympathetic nature.She was
intensely selfish, and was resolved only to marry a man who could
gratify her taste for finery and luxurious living.Sinclair, who kept the boarding-house, and
though living in dependence upon her aunt, did nothing to relieve her
from the care and drudgery incidental to her business."It's too provoking," she said, pouting."So it is, Virginia;" and Talbot tried to take her hand, but she quietly
withdrew it."You told me that you would have plenty of money by this time, Mr."I expected it, but a man can't foresee the fluctuations of Wall street.I am afraid I shall meet with a loss.""I don't believe you are as smart as Sam Eustis--he's engaged to my
cousin.He made ten thousand dollars last month on Lake Shore.""It's the fools that blunder into luck," said Talbot, irritated."Then you'd better turn fool; it seems to pay," said Virginia, rather
sharply."No need of that--I'm fool enough already," said Talbot, bitterly."Oh, well, if you've only come here to make yourself disagreeable, I'm
sure you'd better stay away," said the young lady, tossing her head."I came here expecting sympathy and encouragement," said Talbot."Instead, you receive me with taunts and coldness.""I will be cheerful
and pleasant when you bring me agreeable news.""Why will you require
impossibilities of me?I have an income of two thousand
dollars a year.We can live comfortably on that, and be happy in a snug
little home.""Thank you; I'd
rather not.It means that I am to be a
household drudge, afraid to spend an extra sixpence--perhaps obliged to
take lodgers, like my aunt.""I am sure you cannot love me when you so coolly give me up for money.""I haven't given you up, but I want you to get money.""Where there's a will, there's a way, Mr.If you really care so
much for me, you will try to support me as I want to live.""Tell me, in a word, what you want.""Well," said Virginia, slowly, "I want to go to Europe for my
honey-moon.I've heard so much of Paris, I know I should like it ever
so much.Then I want to live _respectably_ when I get back.""Well, we must have a nice little house to ourselves, and I think, just
at first, I could get along with three servants; and I should want to go
to the opera, and the theater, and to concerts.""You have not been accustomed to live in that way, Virginia.""No; and that's why I have made up my mind not to marry unless my
husband can gratify me.""Yes, I think so," said Virginia, coolly."And you would desert me for a richer suitor?""Of course I would rather marry you--you know that," said Virginia, with
perfect self-possession; "but if you can't meet my conditions, perhaps
it is better that we should part.""No; only sensible," she returned, calmly."I don't mean to marry you
and be unhappy all my life; and I can't be happy living in the stuffy
way my aunt does.We should both be sorry for such a marriage when it
was too late.""I will take the risk, Virginia," said Talbot, fixing his eyes with
passionate love on the cold-hearted girl."But I will not," said Virginia, decidedly."I am sure you needn't take
it to heart, Mr.Why don't you exert yourself and win a fortune,
as other people do?I am sure plenty of money is made in Wall street."Come now, smooth your face, and tell me you will
try," she said, coaxingly."Yes, Virginia, I will try," he answered, his face clearing."And if I
try----"

"You will succeed," she said, smiling."And now don't let us talk about disagreeable things.Do you know, sir,
it is a week since you took me to any place of amusement?And here I
have been moping at home every evening with my aunt, who is terribly
tiresome, poor old soul!""I would rather spend the evening here with you, Virginia, than go to
any place of amusement.""I don't--if you call by that name being in the company of one you
love.""You would, if you had as little variety as I have.""Tell me one thing, Virginia--you love me, don't you?"asked Talbot, in
whose mind sometimes there rose an unpleasant suspicion that his love
was not returned."Why, of course I do, you foolish man," she said, carelessly."And now,
where are you going to take me?""Where do you want to go, my darling?"To-morrow they play 'The Huguenots.'""I thought you didn't care for music, Virginia?"I want to go because it's fashionable, and I want
to be seen.So, be a good boy, and get some nice seats for to-morrow
evening.""And you'll try to get rich, for my sake?""As soon as you can tell me you have ten thousand dollars, and will
spend half of it on a trip to Europe, I will marry you.""Then I hope to tell you so soon."When Talbot left the house it was with the determination to secure the
sum required by any means, however objectionable.Virginia Conway followed his retreating form with her cool, calculating
glance."I'll give him
two months to raise the money, and if he fails, I think I can captivate
Mr.Cross was a middle-aged grocer, a widower, without children, and
reputed moderately wealthy.Talbot had entered the house, Dan was not far off.Later, he
saw him at the window with Virginia."I suppose that's his young lady," thought Dan.I guess he's
safe for this evening."Stocks took an upward turn, so that Talbot's brokers were willing to
carry them for him longer without an increase of margin.The market
looked so uncertain, however, that he decided to sell, though he only
made himself whole.To escape loss hardly satisfied him, when it was so
essential to make money.He was deeply in love with Virginia Conway, but there was no hope of
obtaining her consent to a marriage unless he could raise money enough
to gratify her desires.He was returning to his boarding-house at a late hour one night, when,
in an unfrequented street, two figures advanced upon him from the
darkness, and, while one seized him by the throat, the other rifled his
pockets.Talbot was not a coward, and having only a few dollars in his
pocket-book, while his watch, luckily, was under repair at Tiffany's, he
submitted quietly to the examination.The pocket-book was opened and its contents eagerly scanned.An exclamation of disgust mingled with profanity followed."Why don't you carry money, like a gentleman?""Ain't you ashamed to carry such a lean wallet as that there?""Really, gentlemen, if I had expected to meet you, I would have provided
myself better," said Talbot, not without a gleam of humor."He's chaffing us Bill," said Mike."You'd better not, if you know what's best for yourself," growled Bill.You ought to have waited till next week, when I'd have
had it for you.""Yes; but they are small, and not worth much.""You've took us in reg'lar!A gent like you ought to have diamond studs,
or a pin, or something of value.""I know it, and I'm sorry I haven't, for your sakes."I look upon you as gentlemen, and treat you
accordingly.In fact, I'm glad I've met with you.""I may be able to put something in your way.""I can't tell you in the street.Is there any quiet place, where we
shall not be disturbed or overheard?""This may be a plant," said Mike, suspiciously."If it is," growled Bill, "you'd better make your will.""I know the risk, and am not afraid.In short, I have a job for you."The men consulted, and finally were led to put confidence in Talbot."We'll hear what you have to say.The three made their way to a dilapidated building on Houston street,
and ascended to the fourth floor.Bill kicked open the door of a room with his foot and strode in.A thin, wretched-looking woman sat in a wooden chair, holding a young
child."Just clear out into the other
room.She meekly obeyed the command of her lord, glancing curiously at Talbot
as she went out.Mike she knew only too well, as one of her husband's
evil companions.The door was closed, but the wife bent her ear to the keyhole and
listened attentively.Suspecting nothing, the conspirators spoke in louder tones than they
were aware of, so that she obtained a pretty clear idea of what was
being planned."Now go ahead," said Bill, throwing himself on the chair his wife had
vacated."We might,'specially if we knowed the combination."Talbot gave the name of his employer and the number of his store."What have you got to do with it?"What are you going to make out of it?"I'll guarantee that you'll find four hundred dollars
there to pay you for your trouble.""If we're caught, it'll be Sing Sing for seven years.""We might do it for five hundred apiece," said Bill.There was a little discussion, but finally this was acceded to.Various
details were discussed, and the men separated."I'm goin' your way," said Mike."All right, thank you, but we'd better separate at the street door."Are you too fine a gentleman to be seen with the likes of me?""Not at all, my friend; but if we were seen together by any of the
police, who know me as book-keeper, it would excite suspicion later."I shouldn't dare to tamper with men like you and Bill.You might find a way to get even with me."said the miserable wife to herself, as she heard through
the keyhole the details of the plan."Bill is getting worse and worse
every day."Here, Nancy, get me something to eat," said Bill, when his visitors had
departed."Yes, Bill, I will get you all there is."The wife brought out from a small closet a slice of bread and a segment
of cheese.said the burly ruffian, turning up his nose."It's all I've got, Bill.""You and your brat have eaten it!"If you will give money, I will provide better."I'll teach you to
complain of me.and he struck the woman two brutal
blows with his fist.One, glancing, struck the child, who began to cry.This further irritated Bill, who, seizing his wife by the shoulders,
thrust her out on the landing."There, stay there with the cursed brat!""I mean to have
one quiet night."The wretched wife crept down stairs, and out into the street, scarcely
knowing what she did.She was not wholly destitute of spirit, and
though she might have forgiven personal injury, felt incensed by the
treatment of her innocent child.she said, pitifully, "must you suffer because your
father is a brute?She sat down on some steps near by; the air was chilly, and she shivered
with the cold, but she tried to shelter her babe as well as she could.She attracted the attention of a boy who was walking slowly by.It was Dan, who had at a distance witnessed Talbot's encounter with the
burglars, and his subsequent friendly companionship with them, and was
trying to ascertain the character of the place which he visited.asked Dan, in a tone of sympathy.[Illustration: "What's the matter with you?"asked Dan, in a tone of
sympathy.Page 148]

"My husband has thrust me out of doors with my poor baby.""I can let you have enough for that.I'll
take you to it, and pay for your lodging, and pay for it in advance."Supported by Dan, the poor woman rose and walked to an humble tavern not
far away."She may know something about Talbot's visit.DAN AS A GOOD SAMARITAN."What made your husband treat you so badly?""Rum has been sinking him lower and lower,
and it's easy to see the end.""You are taking too dark a view of your husband," said Dan, soothingly."He won't go as far as that.""I know him only too well," she said."This very evening he has been
planning a burglary."Dan started, and a sudden suspicion entered his mind."Yes; it is a store on Pearl street."Dan felt that he was on the track of a discovery.He was likely to be
repaid at last for the hours he had spent in detective service.he asked, fixing his eyes intently on the woman."I don't know his name; he is a well-dressed man."Was it a man who came to your rooms this evening?"Here Dan gave a rapid description of
Talbot.He is the book-keeper of the firm."He is to pay a thousand dollars for the job."Bill, I suppose, is your husband?"By this time they had reached a small public-house, of humble exterior,
but likely to afford his companion better accommodations than she had at
home.The woman followed him, with the child in her arms.A stout German, who
appeared to be the proprietor of the establishment, was sitting in an
arm-chair, smoking a pipe.asked the German, with a broad grin."No; she is an acquaintance of mine.Her husband has driven her out of
his house in a fit of drunkenness.asked the Dutchman, shrewdly."Fifty cents a night for the lodging."asked the landlord, upon whom the silver
half-dollar produced a visible impression."Yes," said the woman; "my poor baby is tired.""You had better stay here two nights," said Dan."Don't let your husband
know where you are just yet.Here is money to pay for another night's
lodging, and enough to buy food besides.""But for you I should have
had to stay out all night.""Oh, no; some one would have taken you in.""You don't know this neighborhood; the policeman would have found me,
and taken me to the station-house.For myself I care little; but my poor
babe, who is worse than fatherless----" and she burst into tears.Brighter days may be in store," said Dan,
cheerfully."I will come and see you day after to-morrow," said Dan.Our hero must not be awarded too great credit for his generosity.Rogers would willingly defray all expenses connected with
the discovery, and that the money he had advanced to his unfortunate
companion would be repaid.Had it been otherwise, however, his generous
heart would have prompted him to relieve the woman's suffering.Very early the next morning Dan rang the bell at Mr."The master won't be up for an hour," said the servant."Tell him Dan wishes to see him on business of importance.""I don't think he'll see you.He was up late last night," she said."It's very important you make yourself," said Susan, crossly."I _am_ a person of great importance," said Dan, smiling.Rogers
will see me, you'll find."Two minutes later Susan descended the stairs a little bewildered."You're to walk into the parlor," she said.Rogers came down stairs almost
directly in dressing-gown and slippers."The store is to be broken open to-night and the safe robbed!""By two men living in Houston street--at least, one lives there.""Yes, sir; they are employed by Mr.Dan rehearsed the story, already familiar to our readers, combining with
it some further information he had drawn from the woman."I didn't think Talbot capable of this," said Mr."He has been
in our employ for ten years.I don't like to think of his treachery,
but, unhappily, there is no reason to doubt it.Now, Dan, what is your
advice?""I am afraid my advice wouldn't be worth much, Mr.Rogers," said Dan,
modestly.I am indebted to you for this important
discovery.I won't promise to follow your
advice, but I should like to hear it.""Then, sir, I will ask you a question.Do you want to prevent the
robbery, or to catch the men in the act?""I wish to catch the burglars in the act.""Then, sir, can you stay away from the store to-day?"But how can I take measures to guard
against loss?""No; but Talbot is authorized to sign checks.He will draw money if I am
not at the store."He is to tell the burglars the combination.He will
get it from the janitor.""I will see the janitor, and ask him to give the book-keeper the wrong
word.""I will secretly notify the police, whom he will admit and hide till the
time comes.""Then," continued Dan, flushing with excitement, "we'll wait till the
burglars come, and let them begin work on the safe.While they are at
work, we will nab them.""Yes, sir; I want to be there.""I don't know about that, sir.But if anything is going on to-night, I
want to be in it."Talbot sends me with a large check to the bank,
what shall I do?""He may make off with the money during the day.""I will set another detective to watch him, and have him arrested in
that event.""This is going to be an exciting day," said Dan to himself, as he set
out for the store.TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.As Dan entered the store he noticed that Talbot looked excited and
nervous.Ordinarily the book-keeper would have reprimanded him sharply
for his late arrival, but he was not disposed to be strict this morning."I'm a little late this morning, Mr."Oh, well, you can be excused for once," said Talbot.He wished to disarm suspicion by extra good humor.Besides, he intended
to send Dan to the bank presently for a heavy sum, and thought it best
to be on friendly terms with him.About ten o'clock a messenger entered the store with a note from Mr.It was to this effect:


     "I am feeling rather out of sorts this morning, and shall not come
     to the store.Should you desire to consult me on any subject, send
     a messenger to my house."The only obstacle to
carrying out his plans was the apprehended presence and vigilance of his
employer.About one o'clock he called Dan into the office."Here, Dan," he said, "I want you to go to the bank at once.""Here is a check for twelve thousand dollars--rather a heavy amount--and
you must be very careful not to lose any of it, or to let any one see
that you have so much with you."You may get one hundred dollars in fives and tens, and the remainder in
large bills.""He means to make a big haul," said Dan to himself, as he left the
store."I hope our plans won't miscarry.Rogers to
lose so large a sum."As Dan left the store a man of middle size, who was lounging against a
lamp-post, eyed him sharply.As Dan was turning the corner of the street
he left his post, and, walking rapidly, overtook him."You are in the employ of Barton & Rogers, are you not?""I am a detective, on watch here by order of Mr."He is the book-keeper, is he not?"There is no need of watching till you bring
back the money.Where do you think Talbot will put the money?""In the safe, I think, sir."I believe he will retain the greater part on his
own person.If the men who are to rob the safe got hold of all the money
they would be likely to keep it, and not limit themselves to the sum he
agrees to pay them.""I shall take care to keep Talbot in view.He means to have it understood that all this money has been taken
by the burglars, whereas but a tithe of the sum will be deposited in the
safe.""It seems to me there is a risk of losing the money," he said."Don't be afraid," he said, confidentially."Talbot won't leave the
city.His words inspired confidence, and Dan entered the bank without
misgivings.The check was so large that the bank officials scrutinized it carefully.There was no doubt about its being correct, however."Be very careful, young man," said the disbursing clerk."You've got too
much to lose."Dan deposited one roll of bills in the left inside pocket of his coat,
and the balance in the right pocket, and then buttoned up the coat."I'm a boy of fortune for a short time," he said to himself."I hope
the time will come when I shall have as much money of my own."Dan observed that the detective followed him at a little distance, and
it gave him a feeling of security.Some one might have seen the large
sum of money paid him, and instances had been known where boys in such
circumstances had suddenly been set upon in the open street at midday
and robbed.He felt that he had a friend near at hand who would
interfere in such a case.asked an ill-looking man, suddenly accosting
him."I don't carry one," said Dan, eying the questioner suspiciously."Nor I. I have been very unfortunate.Can't you give me a quarter to buy
me some dinner?""Ask some one else; I'm in a hurry," said Dan, coldly."I'm not as green as you take me for," said Dan to himself.He thought his danger was over, but he was mistaken.Suddenly a large man, with red hair and beard, emerging from Dan knew
not where, laid his hand on his shoulder."Boy," said he, in a fierce undertone, "give me that money you have in
your coat-pocket, or I will brain you.""You forget we are in the public street," said Dan."And you would be--stunned, perhaps killed!""Look here,
boy, I am a desperate man.I know how much money you have with you.Dan looked out of the corner of his eye, to see the detective close at
hand.This gave him courage, for he recognized that the villain was only
speaking the truth, and he did not wish to run any unnecessary risk.He
gave a nod, which brought the detective nearer, and then slipped to one
side, calling:

"Stop thief!"The ruffian made a dash for him, his face distorted with rage, but his
arm was grasped as by an iron vise.exclaimed the detective, and he signaled to
a policeman."You are up to your old tricks again, as I expected.""I have taken nothing," he
added, sullenly.I heard you threatening the boy, unless he gave
up the money in his possession."Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully.Talbot, whose conscience was uneasy, and with good cause, awaited Dan's
arrival very anxiously."No; he was recognized by a policeman, who arrested him as he was on the
point of attacking me."Talbot asked no further questions, considerably to Dan's relief, for he
did not wish to mention the detective if it could be avoided.The book-keeper contented himself with saying, in a preoccupied tone, as
he received the money:

"You can't be too careful when you have much money about you.I am
almost sorry I sent for this money," he proceeded."I don't think I
shall need to use it to-day.""Shall I take it back to the bank, sir?""No; I shall put it in the safe over night.I don't care to risk you or
the money again to-day.""He won't put it in the safe."TALBOT'S SCHEME FAILS.Talbot went into the office where he was alone.But the partition walls
were of glass, and Dan managed to put himself in a position where he
could see all that passed within.The book-keeper opened the package of bills, and divided them into two
parcels.One he replaced in the original paper and labeled it "$12,000."The other he put into another paper, and put into his own pocket.Dan
saw it all, but could not distinguish the denominations of the bills
assigned to the different packages.He had no doubt, however, that the
smaller bills were placed in the package intended to be deposited in the
safe, so that, though of apparently equal value, it really contained
only about one-tenth of the money drawn from the bank.Indeed, he was not observed,
except by Dan, whose business it was to watch him.The division being made, he opened the safe and placed the package
therein.He was anxious to communicate his discovery to the detective outside,
but for some time had no opportunity.About an hour later he was sent out on an errand.He looked about him in
a guarded manner till he attracted the attention of the outside
detective.The latter, in answer to a slight nod, approached him
carelessly."Well," he asked, "have you any news?"Talbot has divided the money into two
packages, and one of them he has put into his own pocket."He means to appropriate the greater part to his own
use.""Is there anything more for me to do?"Does the book-keeper suspect that he
is watched?""I am afraid he will get away with the money," said Dan, anxiously.Do you know whether there's any woman in the case?""He visits a young lady on Lexington avenue."It is probably on her account that he wishes to
become suddenly rich."This supposition was a correct one, as we know.It did not, however,
argue unusual shrewdness on the part of the detective, since no motive
is more common in such cases.Dan returned to the office promptly, and nothing of importance occurred
during the remainder of the day.Talbot was preparing to leave, he called in the janitor."You may lock the safe," he said."By the way, you may use the word 'Hartford' for the combination.""Be particularly careful, as the safe contains a package of
money--twelve thousand dollars.""Wouldn't it have been better to deposit it in the bank, Mr."Yes, but it was not till the bank closed that I decided not to use it
to-day.However, it is secure in the safe," he added, carelessly."I have no doubt of that, Mr.In turning a street corner, he brushed against a rough-looking man who
was leaning against a lamp-post."I beg your pardon," said the book-keeper, politely."Hartford," said Talbot, in a low tone."They've got the word," said Talbot to himself."Now the responsibility
rests with them.His face flushed, and his eyes lighted up with joy, as he uttered her
name.He was deeply in love, and he felt that at last he was in a
position to win the consent of the object of his passion.He knew, or,
rather, he suspected her to be coldly selfish, but he was infatuated.It
was enough that he had fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him.In a
few days he would be on his way to Europe with the lady of his love.Matters were so arranged that the loss of the twelve thousand dollars
would be credited to the burglars.If his
European journey should excite a shadow of suspicion, nothing could be
proved, and he could represent that he had been lucky in stock
speculations, as even now he intended to represent to Miss Conway.He was not afraid that she would be deeply shocked by his method of
obtaining money, but he felt that it would be better not to trust her
with a secret, which, if divulged, would compromise his safety.Yes, Miss Conway was at home, and she soon entered the room, smiling
upon him inquiringly."Well," she said, "have you any news to tell me?""Virginia, are you ready to fulfill your promise?"asked Talbot,
eagerly."I make so many promises, you know," she said, fencing."Suppose that the conditions are fulfilled, Virginia?"I dared everything, and I have
succeeded.""As you might have done before, had you listened to me."Ten thousand dollars--the amount you required.""We will make the grand
tour?"She stooped and pressed a kiss lightly upon his cheek.It was a mercenary kiss, but he was so much in love that he felt repaid
for the wrong and wickedness he had done.It would not always be so,
even if he should never be detected, but for the moment he was happy."Now let us form our plans," he said."Will you marry me to-morrow
evening?"We will call on a clergyman, quietly, to-morrow
evening, and in fifteen minutes we shall be man and wife.On Saturday a
steamer leaves for Europe.I can hardly believe that I shall so soon
realize the dreams of years."How can you be spared from your business?""No; not till you are almost ready to start.""It is better that there should be no gossip about it.Besides, your
aunt would probably be scandalized by our hasty marriage, and insist
upon delay.That's something we should neither of us be willing to
consent to.""No, for it would interfere with our European trip.""You consent, then, to my plans?""Yes; I will give you your own way this time," said Virginia, smiling."And you will insist on having your own way ever after?""Of course," she said; "isn't that right?""I am afraid I must consent, at any rate; but, since you are to rule,
you must not be a tyrant, my darling."Talbot agreed to stay to dinner; indeed, it had been his intention from
the first.He remained till the city clocks struck eleven, and then took
leave of Miss Conway at the door.He set out for his boarding-place, his mind filled with thoughts of his
coming happiness, when a hand was laid on his arm.He wheeled suddenly, and his glance fell on a quiet man--the detective."You are suspected
of robbing the firm that employs you."exclaimed Talbot, putting on a bold face,
though his heart sank within him."I hope so; but you must accompany me, and submit to a search.If my
suspicions are unfounded, I will apologize."I will give you into
custody."The detective put a whistle to his mouth, and his summons brought a
policeman."Take this man into custody," he said.exclaimed Talbot; but he was very pale."You will be searched at the station-house, Mr."I hope nothing will be found to criminate you.Talbot, with a swift motion, drew something from his pocket, and hurled
it into the darkness.The detective darted after it, and brought it back."This is what I wanted," he said."Policeman, you will bear witness
that it was in Mr.I fear we shall have to detain
you a considerable time, sir."Fate had turned against him, and he was
sullen and desperate.he asked himself; but no answer suggested
itself.In the house on Houston street, Bill wasted little regret on the absence
of his wife and child.Neither did he trouble himself to speculate as to
where she had gone."I'm better without her," he said to his confederate, Mike."She's
always a-whinin' and complainin', Nance is.If I speak a rough word to her, and it stands to reason a chap can't
always be soft-spoken, she begins to cry.I like to see a woman have
some spirit, I do.""They may have too much," said Mike, shrugging his shoulders."My missus
ain't much like yours.If I speak rough to
her, she ups with something and flings it at my head."Oh, I just leave her to get over it; that's the best way.""Why, you're not half a man, you ain't.Do
you want to know what I'd do if a woman raised her hand against me?""I'd beat her till she couldn't see!"said Bill, fiercely; and he looked
as if he was quite capable of it."You haven't got a wife like mine.""Just you take me round there some time, Mike.If she has a tantrum,
turn her over to me."He was not as great a ruffian as Bill, and the
proposal did not strike him favorably.His wife was certainly a virago, and though strong above the average, he
was her superior in physical strength, but something hindered him from
using it to subdue her.So he was often overmatched by the shrill-voiced
vixen, who knew very well that he would not proceed to extremities.Had
she been Bill's wife, she would have had to yield, or there would have
been bloodshed."I say, Bill," said Mike, suddenly, "how much did your wife hear of our
plans last night?""If she had she would not dare to say a word," said Bill, carelessly."She knows I'd kill her if she betrayed me," said Bill."There ain't no
use considerin' that.""Well, I'm glad you think so.It would be awkward if the police got wind
of it.""What do you think of that chap that's puttin' us up to it?""I don't like him, but I like his money.""Five hundred dollars a-piece ain't much for the risk we run.""If we don't find more in the safe, we'll bleed him when all's over.It was true that Bill was the leading spirit.He was reckless and
desperate, while Mike was apt to count the cost, and dwell upon the
danger incurred.They had been associated more than once in unlawful undertakings; and
though both had served a short term of imprisonment, they had in
general escaped scot-free.It was Bill who hung round the store, and who received from Talbot at
the close of the afternoon the "combination," which was to make the
opening of the safe comparatively easy."It's a good thing to have a friend inside," he said to his confederate."There'll be the janitor to dispose of," suggested Mike."Don't kill him if you can help it, Bill.Murder has an ugly look, and
they'll look out twice as sharp for a murderer as for a burglar.He can wake up when we're
gone, but we'll tie him so he can't give the alarm."Obey
orders, and I'll bring you out all right."So the day passed, and darkness came on.The janitor, or watchman, was a sturdy old man, who in early life had
been a sailor.Some accident had made him lame, and this incapacitated
him for his early vocation.It had not, however, impaired his physical
strength, which was very great, and Mr.Rogers was glad to employ him in
his present capacity.When Jack Green--Jack was the name he generally went by--heard of the
contemplated burglary, he was excited and pleased.It was becoming
rather tame to him to watch night after night without interruption, and
he fancied he should like a little scrimmage.He even wanted to
withstand the burglars single-handed."What's the use of callin' in the police?""It's only two men,
and old Jack is a match for two.""You're a strong man, Jack," said Dan, "but one of the burglars is as
strong as you are.He's broad-shouldered and
big-chested.""I ain't afraid of him," said Jack, defiantly."Perhaps not, but there's another man, too.But Jack finally yielded, though reluctantly, and three policemen were
admitted about eight o'clock, and carefully secreted, to act when
necessary.Jack pleaded for the privilege of meeting the burglars first,
and the privilege was granted, partly in order that they might be taken
in the act.Old Jack was instructed how to act, and though it was a part
not wholly in accordance with his fearless spirit, he finally agreed to
do as he was told.It is not necessary to explain how the burglars effected their entrance.This was effected about twelve o'clock, and by the light of a
dark-lantern Bill and Mike advanced cautiously toward the safe.At this point old Jack made his appearance, putting on an air of alarm
and dismay.he demanded, in a tone which he partially succeeded in
making tremulous."Keep quiet, and we will do you no harm."All right; I'll do it myself.The word agreed with the information
they had received from Talbot.It served to convince them that the
janitor had indeed succumbed, and could be relied upon.There was no
suspicion in the mind of either that there was any one else in the
establishment, and they felt moderately secure from interruption."Here, old fellow, hold the lantern while we go to work.Just behave
yourself, and we'll give you ten dollars--shall we, Mike?""Yes," answered Mike; "I'm agreed.""It'll look as if I was helpin' to rob my master," objected Jack."Oh, never mind about that; he won't know it.When all is over we'll tie
you up, so that it will look as if you couldn't help yourself.Jack felt like making a violent assault upon the man who was offering
him a bribe, but he controlled his impulse, and answered:

"I'm a poor man, and ten dollars will come handy.""All right," said Bill, convinced by this time that Jack's fidelity was
very cheaply purchased.He plumed himself on his success in converting
the janitor into an ally, and felt that the way was clear before him."Mike, give the lantern to this old man, and come here and help me."Old Jack took the lantern, laughing in his sleeve at the ease with which
he had gulled the burglars, while they kneeled before the safe.It was then that, looking over his shoulder, he noticed the stealthy
approach of the policemen, accompanied by Dan.Setting down the lantern, he sprang upon the back of Bill as
he was crouching before him, exclaiming:

"Now, you villain, I have you!"The attack was so sudden and unexpected that Bill, powerful as he was,
was prostrated, and for an instant interposed no resistance."You'll repent this, you old idiot!"he hissed between his closed teeth,
and, in spite of old Jack's efforts to keep him down, he forced his way
up.At the same moment Mike, who had been momentarily dazed by the sudden
attack, seized the janitor, and, between them both, old Jack's life was
likely to be of a very brief tenure.But here the reinforcements
appeared, and changed the aspect of the battle.One burly policeman seized Bill by the collar, while Mike was taken in
hand by another, and their heavy clubs fell with merciless force on the
heads of the two captives.In the new surprise Jack found himself a free man, and, holding up the
lantern, cried, exultingly:

"If I am an old idiot, I've got the better of you, you scoundrels!It was hard for him to give in, but the
fight was too unequal."Mike," said he, "this is a plant.I wish I had that cursed book-keeper
here; he led us into this.""Yes," answered Bill; "he put us up to this."No need to curse him," said Jack, dryly; "he meant you to succeed.""Didn't he tell you we were coming to-night?""How did you find it out, then?""It wasn't enough; but we should have got more out of him.""Before you go away with your prisoners," said Jack to the policeman, "I
wish to open the safe before you, to see if I am right in my suspicions.Talbot drew over ten thousand dollars from the bank to-day, and led
us to think that he deposited it in the safe.I wish to ascertain, in
the presence of witnesses, how much he placed there, and how much he
carried away.""That cursed book-keeper deceived us, then."Burglar," said old Jack, indifferently."There's an
old saying, 'Curses, like chickens, still come home to roost.'Your
cursing won't hurt me any.""If my curses don't my fists may!"retorted Bill, with a malignant look."You won't have a chance to carry out your threats for some years to
come, if you get your deserts," said Jack, by no means terrified."I've
only done my duty, and I'm ready to do it again whenever needed."By this time the safe was open; all present saw the envelope of money
labeled "$12,000."The two burglars saw the prize which was to have rewarded their efforts
and risk with a tantalizing sense of defeat.They had been so near
success, only to be foiled at last, and consigned to a jail for a term
of years.muttered Bill, bitterly, and in his heart Mike said
amen."Gentlemen, I will count this money before you," said the janitor, as he
opened the parcel.It resulted, as my readers already
know, in the discovery that, in place of twelve thousand, the parcel
contained but one thousand dollars."Gentlemen, will you take
notice of this?Of course it is clear where the rest is gone--Talbot
carried it away with him.""By this time he is in custody," said Jack."Look here, old man, who engineered this thing?""Come here, Dan," said Jack, summoning our hero, who modestly stood in
the background.Burglar, this boy is entitled to the credit of
defeating you.We should have known nothing of your intentions but for
Dan, the Detective.""Why, I could crush him with one hand.""Force is a good thing, but brains are better," said Jack."Dan here has
got a better head-piece than any of us.""You've done yourself credit, boy," said the chief policeman."When I
have a difficult case I'll send for you.""You are giving me more credit than I deserve," said Dan, modestly."If I ever get out of jail, I'll remember you," said Bill, scowling."I
wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a man, but to be laid by the
heels by a boy like you--that's enough to make me sick.""You've said enough, my man," said the policeman who had him in charge.The two prisoners, escorted by their captors, made their unwilling way
to the station-house.They were duly tried, and were sentenced to a ten
years' term of imprisonment.As for Talbot, he tried to have it believed that he took the money found
on him because he distrusted the honesty of the janitor; but this
statement fell to the ground before Dan's testimony and that of Bill's
wife.He, too, received a heavy sentence, and it was felt that he only got his
just deserts.*       *       *       *       *       *       *

On the morning after the events recorded above, Mr.Rogers called Dan
into the counting-room."Dan," he said, "I wish to express to you my personal obligations for
the admirable manner in which you have managed the affair of this
burglary.""I am convinced that but for you I should have lost twelve thousand
dollars.It would not have ruined me, to be sure, but it would have been
a heavy loss.""Such a loss as that would have ruined me," said Dan, smiling."So I should suppose," assented his employer."I predict, however, that
the time will come when you can stand such a loss, and have something
left.""As there must always be a beginning, suppose you begin with that."Rogers had turned to his desk and written a check, which he handed
to Dan.This was the way it read:


     No.Pay to Dan Mordaunt or order One Thousand Dollars.Dan took the check, supposing it might be for twenty dollars or so.When
he saw the amount, he started in excitement and incredulity."It is a large sum for a boy like you,
Dan."But, sir, you don't mean all this for me?"It is less than ten per cent on the money you have saved
for us.""How can I thank you for your kindness, sir?"By the way, what wages do we pay
you?""It is a little better than selling papers in front of the Astor House,
isn't it, Dan?"Now, Dan, let me give you two
pieces of advice.""First, put this money in a good savings-bank, and don't draw upon it
unless you are obliged to."And next, spend a part of your earnings in improving your education.You have already had unusual advantages for a boy of your age, but you
should still be learning.It may help you, in a business point of view,
to understand book-keeping."Dan not only did this, but resumed the study of both French and German,
of which he had some elementary knowledge, and advanced rapidly in all.Punctually every month Dan received a remittance of sixty dollars
through a foreign banker, whose office was near Wall street.Of this sum it may be remembered that ten dollars were to be
appropriated to Althea's dress.Of the little girl it may be said she was very happy in her new home.Mordaunt, whom she called mamma,
while she always looked forward with delight to Dan's return at night.Mordaunt was very happy in the child's companionship, and found the
task of teaching her very congenial.But for the little girl she would have had many lonely hours, since Dan
was absent all day on business."I don't know what I shall do, Althea, when you go to school," she said
one day."I don't want to go to school.Let me stay at home with you, mamma.""For the present I can teach you, my dear, but the time will come when
for your own good it will be better to go to school.I cannot teach you
as well as the teachers you will find there.""You know ever so much, mamma."Compared with you, my dear, I seem to know a great deal, but there are
others who know much more."Althea was too young as yet, however, to attend school, and the happy
home life continued.Mordaunt and Dan often wondered how long their mysterious ward was
to remain with them.If so, how could that
mother voluntarily forego her child's society?These were questions they sometimes asked themselves, but no answer
suggested itself.They were content to have them remain unanswered, so
long as Althea might remain with them.The increase of Dan's income, and the large sum he had on interest,
would have enabled them to live comfortably even without the provision
made for their young ward.Dan felt himself justified in indulging
in a little extravagance."Mother," said he, one evening, "I am thinking of taking a course of
lessons in dancing.""What has put that into your head, Dan?""Julia Rogers is to have a birthday party in two or three months, and I
think from a hint her father dropped to-day I shall have an invitation.I shall feel awkward if I don't know how to dance."Tom Carver will be sure to be there, and if I don't dance, or if I am
awkward, he will be sure to sneer at me.""Will that make you feel bad, Dan?""Not exactly, but I don't want to appear at disadvantage when he is
around.If I have been a newsboy, I want to show that I can take the
part of gentleman as well as he.""Does the ability to dance make a gentleman, Dan?""No, mother, but I should feel awkward without it.I don't want to be a
wall-flower.What do you say to my plan, mother?""Carry it out by all means, Dan.There is no reason why you shouldn't
hold up your head with any of them," and Mrs.Mordaunt's eyes rested
with pride on the handsome face and manly expression of her son."You are a little prejudiced in my favor, mother," said Dan, smiling."If I were as awkward as a cat in a strange garret, you wouldn't see
it."He selected a
fashionable teacher, although the price was high, for he thought it
might secure him desirable acquaintances, purchased a handsome suit of
clothes, and soon became very much interested in the lessons.He had a
quick ear, a good figure, and a natural grace of movement, which soon
made him noticeable in the class, and he was quite in demand among the
young ladies as a partner.He was no less a favorite socially, being agreeable as well as
good-looking.Mordaunt," said the professor, "I wish all my scholars did me as
much credit as you do."Thank you, sir," said Dan, modestly, but he felt gratified.By the time the invitation came Dan had no fears as to acquitting
himself creditably."I hope Tom Carver will be there," he said to his mother, as he was
dressing for the party.Rogers lived in a handsome brown-stone-front house up town.As Dan approached, he saw the entire house brilliantly lighted.He
passed beneath a canopy, over carpeted steps, to the front door, and
rang the bell.The door was opened by a stylish-looking <DW52> man, whose grand air
showed that he felt the importance and dignity of his position.As Dan passed in he said:

"Gentlemen's dressing-room third floor back."With a single glance through the open door at the lighted parlors, where
several guests were already assembled, Dan followed directions, and went
up stairs.Entering the dressing-room, he saw a boy carefully arranging his hair
before the glass."That's my friend, Tom Carver," said Dan to himself.Tom was so busily engaged at his toilet that he didn't at once look at
the new guest.When he had leisure to look up, he seemed surprised, and
remarked, superciliously:

"I didn't expect to see _you_ here.""Are you engaged to look after this room?"With all my heart, if you'll brush me," answered Dan, partly offended
and partly amused."Our positions are rather different, I think."You are a guest of Miss Rogers, and so am I.""You don't mean to say that you are going down into the parlor?""A boy who sells papers in front of the Astor House is not a suitable
guest at a fashionable party.""That is not your affair," said Dan, coldly."But it is not true that I
sell papers anywhere.""And I will again, if necessary," answered Dan, as he took Tom's place
in front of the glass and began to arrange his toilet.Then, for the first time, Tom took notice that Dan was dressed as well
as himself, in a style with which the most captious critic could not
find fault.He would have liked
to see Dan in awkward, ill-fitting, or shabby clothes.It seemed to him
that an ex-newsboy had no right to dress so well, and he was greatly
puzzled to understand how he could afford it."It is not remarkable that I should be well dressed."So can I," answered Dan, laconically."Do you mean to say that you bought that suit and paid for it?""You are very kind to take so much interest in me.It may relieve your
mind to see this."Dan took a roll of bills from his pocket, and displayed them to the
astonished Tom."I don't see where you got so much money," said Tom, mystified."I've got more in the bank," said Dan."I mention it to you that you
needn't feel bad about my extravagance in buying a party suit.""I wouldn't have come to this party if I had been you," said Tom,
changing his tone."You'll be so awkward, you know.You don't know any one except Miss
Rogers, who, of course, invited you out of pity, not expecting you would
accept.""You forget I know you," said Dan, smiling again."I beg you won't presume upon our former slight acquaintance," said Tom,
hastily."I shall be so busily occupied that I really can't give you any
attention.""Then I must shift for myself, I suppose," said Dan, good-humoredly."Go first, if you like," said Tom, superciliously."He doesn't want to go down with me," thought Dan."Perhaps I shall
surprise him a little;" and he made his way down stairs.As Dan entered the parlors he saw the young lady in whose honor the
party was given only a few feet distant.He advanced with perfect ease, and paid his respects."I am very glad to see you here this evening, Mr.Mordaunt," said Julia,
cordially."I had no idea he would look
so well."Mentally she pronounced him the handsomest young gentleman present."Take your partners for a quadrille, young gentlemen," announced the
master of ceremonies."Not as yet," answered the young lady, smiling.So it happened that as Tom Carver entered the room, he beheld, to his
intense surprise and disgust, Dan leading the young hostess to her place
in the quadrille."I suppose he
never attempted to dance in his life.It will be fun to watch his
awkwardness.I am very much surprised that Julia should condescend to
dance with him--a common newsboy."At first Tom thought he wouldn't dance, but Mrs.Rogers approaching
said:

"Tom, there's Jane Sheldon.Accordingly Tom found himself leading up a little girl of eight.There was no place except in the quadrille in which Dan and Julia Rogers
were to dance.Tom found himself one of the "sides.""Good-evening, Julia," he said, catching the eye of Miss Rogers."I am too late to be your partner.""Yes, but you see I am not left a wall-flower," said the young lady,
smiling.Mordaunt kindly relieved me of that apprehension.""You are fortunate," said Tom, sneering."I leave my partner to thank you for that compliment," said Julia,
determined not to gratify Tom by appearing to understand the sneer."There's no occasion," said Tom, rudely."I am glad of it," said Dan, "for I am so unused to compliments that I
am afraid I should answer awkwardly.""I can very well believe that," returned Tom, significantly.She looked offended rather for she felt that
rudeness to her partner reflected upon herself.But here the music struck up, and the quadrille began."Now for awkwardness," said Tom to himself, and he watched Dan closely.But, to his surprise, nothing could be neater or better modulated than
Dan's movements.Instead of hopping about, as Tom thought he would, he
was thoroughly graceful."Where could the fellow have learned to dance?"he asked himself, in
disappointment.Julia was gratified; for, to tell the truth, she too had not been
altogether without misgivings on the subject of Dan's dancing, and,
being herself an excellent dancer, she would have found it a little
disagreeable if Dan had proved awkward.The quadrille proceeded, and Tom was chagrined that the newsboy, as he
mentally termed Dan, had proved a better dancer than himself."Oh, well, it's easy to dance in a quadrille," he said to himself, by
way of consolation."He won't venture on any of the round dances."But as Dan was leading Julia to her seat he asked her hand in the next
polka, and was graciously accepted.He then bowed and left her, knowing that he ought not to monopolize the
young hostess.Although Tom had told Dan not to expect any attentions from him, he was
led by curiosity to accost our hero."It seems that newsboys dance," said he."But it was not in very good taste for you to engage Miss Rogers for the
first dance.""Somebody had to be prominent, or Miss Rogers would have been left to
dance by herself.""There are others who would have made more suitable partners for her.""I am sorry to have stood in your way."I shall have plenty of opportunities of dancing
with her, and you won't.I suppose she took pity on you, as you know no
other young lady here."Just then a pretty girl, beautifully dressed, approached Dan.Mordaunt," she said, offering her hand with a beaming
smile."Good-evening, Miss Carroll," said Dan.In a minute Dan was whirling round the room with the young lady, greatly
to Tom's amazement, for Edith Carroll was from a family of high social
standing, living on Murray Hill."How in the duse does Dan Mordaunt know that girl?"To Tom's further disappointment Dan danced as gracefully in the galop as
in the quadrille.When the galop was over, Dan promenaded with another young lady, whose
acquaintance he had made at dancing-school, and altogether seemed as
much at his ease as if he had been attending parties all his life.Tom managed to obtain Edith Carroll as a partner."I didn't know you were acquainted with Dan Mordaunt," he said."Oh, yes, I know him very well.Why I think he dances _beautifully_,
and so do all the girls.""How do the girls know how he dances?""Why he goes to our dancing-school.The professor says he is his best
pupil."That's fortunate for him," said Tom, with a sneer."Perhaps he may
become a dancing-master in time.""He would make a good one, but I don't think he's very likely to do
that.""It would be a good thing for him.He is as well-dressed as any
young gentleman here."This was true, and Tom resented it.He felt that Dan had no right to
dress well."He ought not to spend so much money on dress when he has his mother to
support," he said, provoked."It seems to me you take a great deal of interest in Mr.Mordaunt," said
the young beauty, pointedly."Oh, no; he can do as he likes for all me, but, of course, when a boy
in his position dresses as if he were rich one can't help noticing it.""I am sure he can't be very poor, or he could not attend Dodworth's
dancing-school.At any rate I like to dance with him, and I don't care
whether he's poor or rich."Presently Tom saw Dan dancing the polka with Julia Rogers, and with the
same grace that he had exhibited in the other dances.He felt jealous, for he fancied himself a favorite with Julia, because
their families being intimate, he saw a good deal of her.On the whole Tom was not enjoying the party.He did succeed, however, in
obtaining the privilege of escorting Julia to supper.Just in front of him was Dan, escorting a young lady from Fifth avenue.Mordaunt appears to be enjoying himself," said Julia Rogers."Yes, he has plenty of cheek," muttered Tom."Excuse me, Tom, but do you think such expressions suitable for such an
occasion as this?""I am sorry you don't like it, but I never saw a more forward or
presuming fellow than this Dan Mordaunt.""I beg you to keep your opinion to yourself," said Julia Rogers, with
dignity."I find he is a great favorite with all the young ladies here.I had no idea he knew so many of them."It seemed to him that all the girls were infatuated with
a common newsboy, while his vanity was hurt by finding himself quite
distanced in the race.About twelve o'clock the two boys met in the dressing-room."You seemed to enjoy yourself," said Tom, coldly."Yes, thanks to your kind attentions," answered Dan, with a smile."It
is pleasant to meet old friends, you know.By the way, I suppose we
shall meet at Miss Carroll's party.""So the young lady tells me," answered Dan, smiling."I suppose _you'll_ be giving a fashionable party next," said Tom, with
a sneer.But Dan's dreams were by no means sweet that night.When he reached home, it was to hear of a great and startling
misfortune.At half-past twelve Dan ascended the stairs to his mother's room.He had
promised to come in and tell her how he had enjoyed himself at the
party.He was in excellent spirits on account of the flattering
attentions he had received.It was in this frame of mind that he opened
the door.What was his surprise, even consternation, when his mother
advanced to meet him with tearful eyes and an expression of distress."Oh, Dan, I am so glad you have got home!""I am quite well, Dan; but Althea----"

And Mrs.You don't mean she is----"

He couldn't finish the sentence, but his mother divined what he meant.she said, "but she has disappeared--she has been
stolen."Mordaunt told what she knew, but that related only to the
particulars of the abduction.We are in a position to tell the reader
more, but it will be necessary to go back for a month, and transfer the
scene to another continent.In a spacious and handsomely furnished apartment at the West End of
London sat the lady who had placed Althea in charge of the Mordaunts.She was deep in thought, and that not of an agreeable nature."I fear," she said to herself, "that trouble awaits me.John Hartley,
whom I supposed to be in California, is certainly in London.I cannot be
mistaken in his face, and I certainly saw him in Hyde Park to-day.I don't know, but I fear he did.If so, he will not long
delay in making his appearance.Then I shall be persecuted, but I must
be firm.He shall not learn through me where Althea is.He is her
father, it is true, but he has forfeited all claim to her guardianship.A confirmed gambler and drunkard, he would soon waste her fortune,
bequeathed her by her poor mother.He can have no possible claim to it;
for, apart from his having had no hand in leaving it to her, he was
divorced from my poor sister before her death."At this point there was a knock at the door of the room.There entered a young servant-maid, who courtesied, and said:

"Mrs.Vernon, there is a gentleman who wishes to see you.""Yes, mum; he said his name was Bancroft."I know no one of that name," mused the lady."Well, Margaret,
you may show him up, and you may remain in the anteroom within call."Her eyes were fixed upon the door with natural curiosity, when her
visitor entered.Instantly her face flushed, and her eyes sparkled with anger."I see you know me, Harriet Vernon," he said."It is some time since we
met, is it not?I am charmed, I am sure, to see my sister-in-law looking
so well."He sank into a chair without waiting for an invitation."When did you change your name to Bancroft?"demanded the lady,
abruptly."Oh," he said, showing his teeth, "that was a little ruse.I feared you
would have no welcome for John Hartley, notwithstanding our near
relationship, and I was forced to sail under false colors.""It was quite in character," said Mrs.Vernon, coldly; "you were always
false.The slender tie that
connected us was broken when my sister obtained a divorce from you.""You think so, my lady," said the visitor, dropping his tone of mocking
badinage, and regarding her in a menacing manner, "but you were never
more mistaken.You may flatter yourself that you are rid of me, but you
flatter yourself in vain.""Do you come here to threaten me, John Hartley?""I come here to ask for my child."Where you cannot get at her," answered Mrs."Don't think to put me off in that way," he said, fiercely."Don't think to terrify me, John Hartley," said the lady,
contemptuously."I am not so easily alarmed as your poor wife."Hartley looked at her as if he would have assaulted her had he dared,
but she knew very well that he did not dare.He was a bully, but he was
a coward."You refuse, then, to tell me what you have done with my child?"A father has some rights, and the law will not permit
his child to be kept from him.""Does your anxiety to see Althea arise from parental affection?"she
asked, in a sarcastic tone.I have a right to the custody of my
child.""I suppose you have a right to waste her fortune also at the
gaming-table.""I have a right to act as my child's guardian," he retorted."Why should you not, John Hartley?You
ill-treated and abused her mother.Fortunately, she escaped from you before it was all gone.But you
shortened her life, and she did not long survive the separation.It was
her last request that I should care for her child--that I should, above
all, keep her out of your clutches.I made that promise, and I mean to
keep it.""You poisoned my wife's mind against me," he said."But for your cursed
interference we should never have separated.""You are right, perhaps, in your last statement.I certainly did urge my
sister to leave you.I obtained her consent to the application for a
divorce, but as to poisoning her mind against you, there was no need of
that.By your conduct and your treatment you destroyed her love and
forfeited her respect, and she saw the propriety of the course which I
recommended.""I didn't come here to be lectured.You can spare your invectives,
Harriet Vernon.I was not a model husband,
perhaps, but I was as good as the average.""If that is the case, Heaven help the woman who marries!""Or the man that marries a woman like you!""You are welcome to your opinion of me.I am entirely indifferent to
your good or bad opinion."I don't recognize your right to question me on this subject, but I
will answer you.He appeared to be occupied with
some thought.When he spoke it was in a more conciliatory tone."I don't doubt that she is in good hands," he said."I am sure you will
treat her kindly.Perhaps you are a better guardian than I. I am willing
to leave her in your hands, but I ought to have some compensation.""Althea has a hundred thousand dollars, yielding at least five thousand
dollars income.Probably her expenses are little more than one-tenth of
this sum.Give me half her income--say
three thousand dollars annually--and I will give you and her no further
trouble.""I thought that was the object of your visit," said Mrs."I was right in giving you no credit for parental affection.In regard
to your proposition, I cannot entertain it.You had one half of my
sister's fortune, and you spent it.You have no further claim on her
money.""Then I swear to you that I will be even with you.I will find the
child, and when I do you shall never see her again.""Margaret," she said, coldly, "will you show this gentleman out?""You are certainly very polite, Harriet Vernon," he said."You are bold,
too, for you are defying me, and that is dangerous.You had better
reconsider your determination, before it is too late.""It will never be too late; I can at any time buy you off," she said,
contemptuously."We shall see," he hissed, eying her malignantly.Vernon, when her visitor had been shown out,
"never admit that person again; I am always out to him.""I wonder who 'twas," she thought, curiously.John Hartley, when a young man, had wooed and won Althea's mother.Julia
Belmont was a beautiful and accomplished girl, an heiress in her own
right, and might have made her choice among at least a dozen suitors.That she should have accepted the hand of John Hartley, a banker's
clerk, reputed "fast," was surprising, but a woman's taste in such a
case is often hard to explain or justify.Vernon--strenuously objected to the match, and by so doing gained the
hatred of her future brother-in-law.Opposition proved ineffectual, and
Julia Belmont became Mrs.Her fortune amounted to two hundred
thousand dollars.The trustee and her sister succeeded in obtaining her
consent that half of this sum should be settled on herself, and her
issue, should she have any.John Hartley resigned his position
immediately after marriage, and declined to enter upon any business."Julia and I have enough to live upon.If I am
out of business I can devote myself more entirely to her."This reasoning satisfied his young wife, and for a time all went well.But Hartley joined a fashionable club, formed a taste for gambling,
indulged in copious libations, not unfrequently staggering home drunk,
to the acute sorrow of his wife, and then excesses soon led to
ill-treatment.The money, which he could spend in a few years, melted
away, and he tried to gain possession of the remainder of his wife's
property.But, meanwhile, Althea was born, and a consideration for her
child's welfare strengthened the wife in her firm refusal to accede to
this unreasonable demand."You shall have the income, John," she said--"I will keep none back; but
the principal must be kept for Althea.""You care more for the brat than you do for me," he muttered."I care for you both," she answered."You know how the money would go,
John."That meddling sister of yours has put you up to this," he said,
angrily.It is right, and I have decided for myself.""I feel that in refusing I am doing my duty by you.""It is a strange way--to oppose your husband's wishes.Women ought never
to be trusted with money--they don't know how to take care of it.""You are not the person to say this, John.In five years you have wasted
one hundred thousand dollars.""It was bad luck in investments," he replied.Investing money at the gaming-table is not
very profitable.""Do you mean to insult me, madam?""I am only telling the sad truth, John."She withdrew, flushed and indignant, for she had spirit enough to resent
this outrage, and he left the house in a furious rage.When Hartley found that there was no hope of carrying his point, all
restraint seemed removed.He plunged into worse excesses, and his
treatment became so bad that Mrs.Hartley consented to institute
proceedings for divorce.It was granted, and the child was given to her.When he returned his wife had died of
pneumonia, and her sister--Mrs.Vernon, now a widow--had assumed the
care of Althea.An attempt to gain possession of the child induced her
to find another guardian for the child.This was the way Althea had
come into the family of our young hero.Thus much, that the reader may understand the position of affairs, and
follow intelligently the future course of the story.When John Hartley left the presence of his sister-in-law, he muttered
maledictions upon her."I'll have the child yet, if only to spite her," he muttered, between
his teeth."I won't allow a jade to stand between me and my own flesh
and blood.I must think of some plan to circumvent her."He had absolutely no clew, and little money to assist
him in his quest.But Fortune, which does not always favor the brave,
but often helps the undeserving, came unexpectedly to his help.At an American banker's he ran across an old acquaintance--one who had
belonged to the same club as himself in years past."What are you doing here, Hartley?"By the way, I was reminded of you not long since.""I saw your child in Union Square, in New York.""Are you sure it was my
child?""Of course; I used to see it often, you know."Don't _you_ know where she lives?""No; her aunt is keeping the child from me.She was with a middle-aged lady, who evidently
was suspicious of me, for she did not bring out the child but once more,
and was clearly anxious when I took notice of her.""She was acting according to instructions, no doubt.""So do I. Why do they keep _you_ away from her?""Because she has money, and they wish to keep it in their hands," said
Hartley, plausibly.She is living
here in London, doubtless on my little girl's fortune."John Hartley knew that this was not true, for Mrs.Vernon was a rich
woman; but it suited his purpose to say so, and the statement was
believed by his acquaintance."This is bad treatment, Hartley," he said, in a tone of sympathy."What are you going to do about it?""Try to find out where the child is placed, and get possession of her."This information John Hartley felt to be of value.It narrowed his
search, and made success much less difficult.In order to obtain more definite information, he lay in wait for Mrs.Margaret at first repulsed him, but a sovereign judiciously slipped into
her hand convinced her that Hartley was quite the gentleman, and he had
no difficulty, by the promise of a future douceur, in obtaining her
co-operation."If it's no harm you mean my
missus----"

"Certainly not, but she is keeping my child from me.You can understand
a father's wish to see his child, my dear girl.""Indeed, I think it's cruel to keep her from you, sir.""Then look over your mistress' papers and try to obtain the street and
number where she is boarding in New York."Of course you have, sir," said the girl, readily.So it came about that the girl obtained Dan's address, and communicated
it to John Hartley.As soon as possible afterward Hartley sailed for New York."I'll secure the child," he said to himself, exultingly, "and then my
sweet sister-in-law must pay roundly for her if she wants her back."All which attested the devoted love of John Hartley for his child.ALTHEA'S ABDUCTION.Arrived in New York, John Hartley lost no time in ascertaining where Dan
and his mother lived.In order the better to watch without incurring
suspicion, he engaged by the week a room in a house opposite, which,
luckily for his purpose, happened to be for rent.It was a front window,
and furnished him with a post of observation from which he could see who
went in and out of the house opposite.Hartley soon learned that it would not be so easy as he had anticipated
to gain possession of the little girl.She never went out alone, but
always accompanied either by Dan or his mother.If, now, Althea were attending school, there
would be an opportunity to kidnap her.As it was, he was at his wits'
end.Mordaunt chanced to need some small
article necessary to the work upon which she was engaged.She might
indeed wait until the next day, but she was repairing a vest of Dan's,
which he would need to wear in the morning, and she did not like to
disappoint him."My child," she said, "I find I must go out a little while.""I want to buy some braid to bind Dan's vest.He will want to wear it in
the morning.""May I go with you, mamma?"You can be reading your picture-book till I come back.Mordaunt put on her street dress, and left the house in the
direction of Eighth avenue, where there was a cheap store at which she
often traded.No sooner did Hartley see her leave the house, as he could readily do,
for the night was light, than he hurried to Union Square, scarcely five
minutes distant, and hailed a cab-driver."Do you want a job, my man?""There is nothing wrong, sir, I hope."My child has been kidnapped during my absence in Europe."She is in the custody of some designing persons, who keep possession
of her on account of a fortune which she is to inherit.She does not
know me to be her father, we have been so long separated; but I feel
anxious to take her away from her treacherous guardians."I've got a little girl of my own, and I understand
your feelings.Fifteen minutes afterward the cab drew
up before Mrs.Brown's door, and Hartley, springing from it, rang the
bell.Brown was out, and a servant answered the
bell."A lady lives here with a little girl," he said, quickly."Precisely; and the little girl is named Althea."Mordaunt has been run over by a street-car, and been carried into
my house.She wishes the little girl to come at once to her.""I am afraid her leg is broken; but I can't wait.Will you bring the
little girl down at once?"Nancy went up stairs two steps at a time, and broke into Mrs."Put on your hat at once, Miss Althea," she said."But she said she was coming right back.""She's hurt, and she can't come, and she has sent for you."But how shall I know where to go, Nancy?""There's a kind gentleman at the door with a carriage.Your ma has been
taken to his home."I'm afraid mamma's been killed," she said."No, she hasn't, or how could she send for you?"This argument tended to reassure Althea, and she put on her little shawl
and hat, and hurried down stairs.Hartley was waiting for her impatiently, fearing that Mrs.Mordaunt
would come back sooner than was anticipated, and so interfere with the
fulfillment of his plans."So she calls this woman mamma," said Hartley to himself."Not very badly, but she cannot come home to-night.Get into the
carriage, and I will tell you about it as we are riding to her."He hurried the little girl into the carriage, and taking a seat beside
her, ordered the cabman to drive on.He had before directed him to drive to the South Ferry."She was crossing the street," said Hartley, "when she got in the way of
a carriage and was thrown down and run over."The carriage was not a heavy one, luckily, and
she is only badly bruised.She will be all right in a few days."John Hartley was a trifle inconsistent in his stories, having told the
servant that Mrs.Mordaunt had been run over by a street-car; but in
truth he had forgotten the details of his first narrative, and had
modified it in the second telling.However, Nancy had failed to tell the
child precisely how Mrs.Mordaunt had been hurt, and she was not old
enough to be suspicious."Not far from here," answered Hartley, evasively."Then I shall soon see mamma.""No, not my own mamma, but I call her so."My papa is a very bad man."I thought this was some of Harriet Vernon's work," said Hartley to
himself."It seems like my amiable sister-in-law.She might have been in
better business than poisoning my child's mind against me."he asked, partly out of curiosity, but mainly
to occupy the child's mind, so that she might not be fully conscious of
the lapse of time."Oh, yes; Dan is a nice boy.He has gone to a party
to-night.""And he won't be home till late."I am glad of that," thought Hartley.He goes down town every morning, and he doesn't come home
till supper time."Hartley managed to continue his inquiries about Dan, but at last Althea
became restless."I don't see how mamma could have gone so far.""I see how it is," he said."The cab-driver lost the way, and that has
delayed us."Meanwhile they reached the South
Ferry, and Hartley began to consider in what way he could explain their
crossing the water.After a moment's thought Hartley took a flask from his pocket, into
which he had dropped a sleeping potion, and offered it to the child."Drink, my dear," he said; "it will do you good."It was a sweet wine and pleasant to the taste."It is a cordial," answered Hartley.I will ask mamma to get some."I feel very sleepy," said Althea, drowsily, the potion having already
begun to attack her.The innocent and unsuspecting child did as she was directed.She struggled against the increasing drowsiness, but in
vain."There will be no further trouble," thought Hartley."When she wakes up
it will be morning.It might have been supposed that some instinct of parental affection
would have made it disagreeable to this man to kidnap his own child by
such means, but John Hartley had never been troubled with a heart or
natural affections.He was supremely selfish, and surveyed the sleeping
child as coolly and indifferently as if he had never before set eyes
upon her.Two miles and a half beyond the South Ferry, in a thinly settled
outlying district of Brooklyn, stood a three-story brick house, shabby
and neglected in appearance, bearing upon a sign over the door the name


         DONOVAN'S

     WINES AND LIQUORS.It was the nightly resort of a set of rough and lawless men, many of
them thieves and social outlaws, who drank and smoked as they sat at
small tables in the sand-strewn bar-room.Hugh Donovan himself had served a term at Sing Sing for burglary, and
was suspected to be indirectly interested in the ventures of others
engaged in similar offenses, though he managed to avoid arrest.John Hartley ordered the hackman to stop.He sprang from the carriage,
and unceremoniously entered the bar-room.Donovan, a short, thickset man
with reddish whiskers, a beard of a week's growth, and but one
serviceable eye, sat in a wooden arm-chair, smoking a clay pipe.There
were two other men in the room, and a newsboy sat dozing on a settee.Donovan looked up, and his face assumed a look of surprise as he met the
glance of the visitor, whom he appeared to know.he asked, taking the pipe from
his mouth."I have a job for her and for you."I want her taken care of for a few
days or weeks.""Shure, the old woman isn't a very good protector for a gal.There are reasons--imperative reasons--why the girl
should be concealed for a time, and I can think of no other place than
this."I have little time for explanation, but I may
tell you that she has been kept from me by my enemies, who wanted to get
hold of her money.""Did the old lady leave it all away from you, then?The least I can expect is to be made guardian of my
own child.Is there no way of getting up stairs
except by passing through the bar-room?"Hartley, we can go up the back way.At the rear of the house was a stair-way, up which he
clambered, bearing the sleeping child in his arms.Donovan pushed the door open, and disclosed a dirty room, with his
better-half--a tall, gaunt woman--reclining in a rocking-chair,
evidently partially under the influence of liquor, as might be guessed
from a black bottle on a wooden table near by.She stared in astonishment at her husband's companions."Shure, Hugh, who is it you're bringin' here?""It's a child, old woman, that you're to have the care of.""Divil a bit do I want a child to worrit me.""Will I get the money, or Hugh?""You shall have half, Bridget," said her husband."I will pay ten dollars a week--half to you, and half to your husband,"
said Hartley."Here's a week's pay in advance," and he took out two
five-dollar bills, one of which was eagerly clutched by Mrs."I'll take care of her," said she, readily."Shure that's a quare name.You can call her any name you like," said
Hartley, indifferently."Perhaps you had better call her Katy, as there
may be a hue and cry after her, and that may divert suspicion."Donovan, and she opened the door of a small
room, in which was a single untidy bed.I gave her a sleeping potion--otherwise
she might have made a fuss, for she doesn't know me to be her father."Donovan, I depend upon your keeping her safe.It will not do
to let her escape, for she might find her way back to the people from
whom I have taken her.""Say nothing about me in connection with the matter, Donovan.I will
communicate with you from time to time.If the police are put on the
track, I depend on your sending her away to some other place of
security."I shall go back to New York at once.I must leave
you to pacify her as well as you can when she awakes."I'll trate her like my own child," said Mrs.Had Hartley been a devoted father, this assurance from the coarse,
red-faced woman would have been satisfactory, but he cared only for the
child as a means of replenishing his pockets, and gave himself no
trouble.The hackman was still waiting at the door."It's a queer place to leave a child," thought he, as his experienced
eye took in the features of the place."It appears to be a liquor
saloon.However, it is none of
my business."Driver, I am ready," said Hartley."Go over Fulton Ferry, and leave me at your stand in Union Square."Hartley threw himself back on the seat, and
gave himself up to pleasant self-congratulation."I think this will bring Harriet Vernon to terms," he said."She will
find that she can't stand between me and my child.If she will make it
worth my while, she shall have the child back, but I propose to see that
my interests are secured."The next morning Hartley stepped into an up-town hotel, and wrote a
letter to his sister-in-law in London, demanding that four thousand
dollars be sent him yearly, in quarterly payments, in consideration of
which he agreed to give up the child, and abstain from further
molestation.ALTHEA BECOMES KATY DONOVAN.The sleeping potion which had been administered to Althea kept her in
sound sleep till eight o'clock the next morning.When her eyes opened,
and she became conscious of her surroundings, she looked about her in
surprise.Then she sat up in bed and gazed wildly at the torn wall paper
and dirty and shabby furniture.The door opened, and the red and inflamed face of Mrs."I want mamma," answered the child, still more frightened."Shure I'm your ma, child.""No, you are not," said Althea.I sent you away to board, but
you've come home to live with your ma."You are a bad woman," returned the child,
ready to cry."It's a purty thing for a child to tell her ma she's lyin'.""Don't you go
on talkin' that way, but get right up, or you sha'n't have any
breakfast.""Oh, send me back to my mother and Dan!""Dress yourself, and I'll see about it," said Mrs.Althea looked for her clothes, but could not find them.In their place
she found a faded calico dress and some ragged undergarments, which had
once belonged to a daughter of Mrs."Those clothes are not mine," said Althea."I had a pretty pink dress and a nice new skirt.These was the clothes you took off last night,"
said Mrs."I won't put this dress on," said the child, indignantly."Then you'll have to lay abed all day, and won't get nothing to eat,"
said the woman."Shure you're a quare child to ask your own mother's name."That's a quare name intirely.I'm afraid
you're gone crazy, Katy."Was it possible that she could be Katy Donovan,
and that this red-faced woman was her mother?She began to doubt her own
identity.She could not remember this woman, but was it possible that
there was any connection between them?"I used to live in New York with Mamma Mordaunt.""Well, you're livin' in Brooklyn now with Mamma Donovan.""Shure I shouldn't have sent you away from me to have you come home and
deny your own mother.""Will you let me go to New York and see Mamma Mordaunt?"asked Althea,
after a pause."If you're a good girl, perhaps I will.Now get up, and I'll give you
some breakfast."With a shudder of dislike Althea arrayed herself in the dirty garments
of the real Katy Donovan, and looked at her image in the cracked mirror
with a disgust which she could not repress.Hartley had suggested that her own garments should be taken away in
order to make her escape less feasible.She opened the door, and entered the room in which Mrs.Donovan had set
the table for breakfast.As she came in at one door, Hugh Donovan entered at another."Come here, little gal," he said, with a grin.Althea looked at him with real terror.Certainly Hugh Donovan was not a
man to attract a child.Althea at once thought of an ogre whom Dan had described to her in a
fairy story, and half fancied that she was in the power of such a
creature."I don't want to," said the child, trembling."Go to your father, Katy," said Mrs.Althea shuddered at the idea, and she gazed as if
fascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little
gals--'specially when they're my own.""Yes, you be, and don't you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,
thinking it a good joke."Well, it'll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we'll see
what the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little
bread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house
was responsible.When the meal was over she said:

"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,
and you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they
could be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed
at the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Hugh Donovan's face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what's best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.Her husband took it,
and brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you'll feel it if you don't stop your howlin'."Althea gazed at him horror-stricken."I thought you'd come to your senses," he said, in a tone of
satisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as
she cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and
hopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,
and wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which
at once drew the attention of Mrs."I can't help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip
with which her husband had threatened the child."I'll give ye something
to cry for.""Oh, don't--don't beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.I mean I won't unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart
sinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs."Shure, if you'll be a good gal, I'll give you all the pleasure
I can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged
sun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the
house, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her
supplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child's curiosity on
her way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her
sorrow."Shure it's my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink
which prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become
afraid of her new guardians.She felt
sure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was
Dan to know where she was.The poor child's lips quivered, and she could
hardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea's disappearance that he felt it
necessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her
recovery."I'll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake
thinking of her, for it won't do any good."I didn't know how much I loved the dear child
till I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her
again."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up
bright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won't have any time, Dan.Rogers,
telling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is
to be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not
feel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how
the little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your
mother broke her leg, and I didn't think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to
be of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and
interview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was
absent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying
a gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between
Eighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His
courage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that
a child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea's age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said."You would
have saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan
to himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been
unobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve
as he noted our hero's inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don't think
you'll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:

"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite
the house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly
afterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man's appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I
believe his hair was brown"--Hartley's was black."I am sorry I can't
remember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab
drove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,
'Drive to Harlem.'""Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully."That puts me on the right
track."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me
know," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite
yours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to
deceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of
your search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive
intelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look
after you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while
you are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait
three weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had
one source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet
Vernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be
seriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse
to the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He
did not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of
success should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his
child's expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western
adventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley's want of
character, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a
hazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some
genuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of
shares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a
hundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a
corresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the
overtures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious
investigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and
how well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was
so satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in
train.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful
accomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously
raised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man
from Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as
collateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without
a doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars
between them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary
assistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It's a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he
thought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is
likely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand
of her.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a
Cunard steamer.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and
decided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good
advantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for
sale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting
surprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed
upon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it probable that the man who carried away Althea would give the
right direction so that it could be overheard by a third party?No; it
was probably meant as a blind, and I have been just fool enough to fall
into the trap."Before the day was over they were wholly opened.He met John Hartley on
Broadway toward the close of the afternoon."Well, have you heard anything of your sister?"he asked, with an
appearance of interest."Keep on, you will find her in time."After they parted, Dan, happening to look back, detected a mocking
glance in the face of his questioner, and a new discovery flashed upon
him.He had sent him to Harlem,
purposely misleading him."Can he have had anything to do
with the abduction of Althea?"This was a question which he could not satisfactorily answer, but he
resolved to watch Hartley, and follow him wherever he went, in the hope
of obtaining some clew.Of course he must assume some disguise, as
Hartley must not recognize him.He hired a room on East Fourth street for a week, and then sought an
Italian boy to whom he had occasionally given a few pennies, and with
some difficulty (for Giovanni knew but little English, and he no
Italian) proposed that the Italian should teach him to sing and play
"Viva Garibaldi."Dan could play a little on the violin, and soon
qualified himself for his new business.At a second-hand shop on Chatham street he picked up a suit of tattered
velvet, obtained a liquid with which to stain his skin to a dark brown,
and then started out as an Italian street musician.His masquerade suit
he kept in his room at East Fourth street, changing therefrom his street
dress morning and evening.When in full masquerade he for the first time
sang and played, Giovanni clapped his hands with delight.Giovanni was puzzled to understand why Dan took so much pains to enter
upon a hard and unprofitable profession, but Dan did not enlighten him
as to his motive.He thought it most prudent to keep his secret, even from his mother.One
day he met her on the sidewalk, and began to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Mordaunt listened without a suspicion that it was her own son, and
gave him two pennies, which he acknowledged by a low bow, and "Grazia,
signora.""I hope his padrone does not beat him," said Mrs."I hear these poor boys are much abused.I wonder if I can make him
understand?"Si, signora, padrone," answered Dan."It is no use; he doesn't understand English.Here is some more money
for you," and she handed him a five-cent coin."Its a wise mother that knows her own child," thought Dan.Hartley boarded a University Place car, and Dan jumped on also.Italian boys so seldom ride that the conductor eyed Dan with some
suspicion."I thought you might be expecting to ride for nothing," said the
conductor."Seems to me you're flush for an Italian fiddler.""And I don't understand your lingo."A charitable lady inside the car chanced to see Dan, and it occurred to
her that she would do him a service."If the conductor doesn't object, you may sing while we are on our way."You can sing and play," said the conductor, good-naturedly.Dan was not at all desirous of doing this, for Hartley sat only three
feet from him, and he feared he might recognize him, but it would not be
in character to refuse, so he began, and sang his one air, playing an
accompaniment.Several of the passengers handed him small coins, among
them Hartley."I can't agree with you, ma'am," said Hartley."I would rather give him
money to stop.""His voice strikes me as very rich, and the Italian is such a beautiful
language.""I have heard a good deal better performers even among the street boys,"
said Hartley."So have I," said Dan to himself."He doesn't suspect me; I am glad of
that."Hartley remained in the car till it reached the Astor House, and so, of
course, did Dan.In fact, Hartley was on his way to Brooklyn to pay
another installment to the guardians of the little girl whom he had
carried off.Hartley kept on his way to Fulton Ferry, Dan following at a prudent
distance.Had Hartley looked back, he would have suspected nothing, for he had not
penetrated Dan's disguise, and would therefore have been quite at a loss
to understand any connection between the street musician and himself.They both boarded the same ferry-boat, and landed in Brooklyn together.At this moment Hartley turned round, and his glance fell upon Dan."Si, signor," answered Dan, bowing deferentially."I sing, I play," said our hero."It is lucky you don't, or you might not like my compliment.""Shall I sing 'Viva Garibaldi?'"Here, take
this money, and don't sing.""Si, signor," answered Dan, assuming a look of bewilderment.Hartley prepared to board a car, which was not yet ready to start.Dan
rapidly decided that it would not do for him to follow Hartley any
farther.Looking about him, his eye fell
on a bright-looking newsboy of about twelve."Do you want to make some money, Johnny?""Did you speak to me, Garibaldi?""Yes, but I am no Italian," said Dan, rapidly."I am on the track of
that man, but he suspects me.I will give you a dollar if you will jump
on the car and find out where he goes."Pay your expenses out of it, and I will pay you back when you
report to me."The newsboy ran, jumped on the car, and it moved on."It is the best thing I could do," thought Dan."I hope the boy is
sharp, and won't lose sight of him.I feel sure that he had something
to do with carrying off poor little Althea."For two hours Dan lingered near the ferry, playing occasionally by way
of filling up the time.It seemed to be a good location, for he received
from fifty to sixty cents from passers-by."When hard times come," thought Dan, "I shall know what to do.I will
become an Italian street singer."After two hours the newsboy jumped off an incoming car, and approached
Dan.DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's eyes sparkled with joy at the success of his plan."Now tell me," he said, drawing the newsboy aside to a place where they
would not be overheard."You've made a fortun' by fiddling, you have," said the newsboy, in
surprise.The newsboy described his following Hartley to Donovan's.Hartley went in, and he directly afterward."Perhaps he only went in for a drink," suggested Dan, uneasily."No, he didn't call for nothing to drink.I saw him take out some money
and give to the man and the woman."I axed old Donovan to buy a paper, and he wouldn't.Then I
sat down for a minute, makin' believe I was tired.They looked at me,
but I didn't appear to be noticin' 'em, and they let me stay.""Did you see anything of a little girl?""Yes, there was a little gal came in.Donovan's daughter, he feared, not the
child he was seeking.He added a description of the little girl which quite revived Dan's
hopes, for it answered in every respect to Althea."Did you hear the little girl say anything?""Yes, she told her mother she wanted to see Dan.""You needn't tell me any more."Have you found out what you want to know?"Have you anything to do for the next two hours?""Then I'll pay you another dollar to go to the place with me.I think I
could find it myself, but I can't take any chances.And don't say a word
about what you have seen.""She is my adopted sister, and she has been stolen from us.""Then I'd be willing to help you for nothing.I've got a little sister
about her size.If anybody stole her, I'd mash him!"The two boys boarded a car, and in forty minutes got out."That's the place," said the newsboy, pointing out Donovan's, only a few
rods away.You'd better leave me now, or you may be remembered, and
that would lead them to suspect me.If I do, it'll be through your help."He stopped in the street, and began
to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Two or three boys gathered about him, and finally a couple of men.One
of them handed him a three-cent piece."Grazio, signor," said Dan, pulling off his hat."What part of Italy do you come from?""Si, signor, I come from Italy," answered Dan, not considering it
prudent to understand too well."His hair doesn't look like that of most Italians."I'd know him for an Italian boy anywhere."At this moment the door of the saloon opened, and Dan, putting his
violin under his arm, entered.One was an Irishman, the other a German.Both
had evidently drank more than was good for them.Dan looked in vain for
Althea."Well, boy, what do you want?"asked Dan, uncertain whether he was talking
as an Italian boy might be expected to."No; I don't want to hear any fiddle-scraping.""Shure, let him play a little, Mister Donovan," said the Irishman."Just as you like," said Donovan, carelessly, "only I have no money for
him."Dan struck up his one tune--Viva Garibaldi--but the Irishman did not
seem to care for that."Oh, bother ould Garibaldi!"Accordingly he tried to play an air popular enough at the time, but
made bad work of it.exclaimed the German, who had a better musical ear
than the Irishman."Here, lend me your fiddle, boy."He took the violin, and in spite of his inebriety, managed to play a
German air upon it."Shure you bate the boy at his own trade," said the Irishman.The German indicated his preference, and the Irishman called for whisky."I no drink," answered our hero, shaking his head."Shure you're an Italian wonder, and it's Barnum ought to hire you.""Then you're a haythen," said Pat Moriarty.He gulped down the whisky, and finding it more convenient to sit than to
stand, fell back upon a settee."I wish Althea would come in," thought Dan.At that moment a heavy fall was heard in the room overhead, and a
child's shrill scream directly afterward."Something's happened to my wife," muttered Donovan.He hurried up stairs, and the German followed.This gave Dan an excuse
for running up, too.Donovan had been drinking more copiously than usual.While in this
condition she imprudently got upon a chair to reach a pitcher from an
upper shelf.Her footing was uncertain, and she fell over, pitcher in
hand, the chair sharing in the downfall.When her husband entered the room she was lying flat on her back,
grasping the handle of the pitcher, her eyes closed, and her breathing
stertorious.Althea, alarmed, stood over her, crying and screaming."The old woman's taken too much," said Donovan.he
shouted, leaning over his matrimonial partner."Ain't you ashamed of
yourself, now?"Donovan opened her eyes, and stared at him vacantly."On your back, you old fool, where you deserve to be.""It's the whisky," murmured the fallen lady.Why can't you drink dacent like me?Shure it's a purty
example you're settin' to the child.Ain't you ashamed to lie here in a
hape before them gintlemen?"This called Althea's attention to the German and Dan.In spite of Dan's
disguise, she recognized him with a cry of joy.she exclaimed, dashing past
Donovan, and clasping her arms round the supposed Italian.exclaimed Donovan, looking at the two in surprise."Oh, it's my brother Dan," exclaimed Althea."You'll take me away, won't
you, Dan?"So that's your game, my young chicken, is it?"demanded Donovan,
seizing our hero roughly by the shoulder.Then pulling off Dan's hat, he
added: "You're no more Italian than I am."Dan saw that it would be useless to keep up the deceit any longer.He
looked Donovan full in the face, and said, firmly:

"You are right, Mr.Donovan, I have come here for my sister."Donovan's red face turned fairly purple with rage.Why, I could crush you with my little
finger.""I have not insulted you," said Dan."I don't know anything about your sister."That little girl is my adopted sister," said Dan, pointing to Althea."Ask her if she doesn't know me.""That is my daughter, Katy Donovan," said the saloon keeper."No, I am not," said Althea, beginning to cry."I want to go away with
my brother Dan."Donovan," (by
this time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), "is
not this our little Katy?""You see, young man, you're mistaken.You can leave," and Donovan waved
his hand triumphantly.I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since
living with my mother."said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his
fingers."I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house," continued
Dan."The same man has been here to-day," added Dan.How much does he pay you for taking
care of the girl?""I can't waste my time
talkin' wid you."No, I won't, unless Althea goes with me," said Dan, firmly.We'll see about that," and Donovan, making a rush,
seized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero's
resistance."I'll tache you to come here insultin' your betters!"Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match
for a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance.The Irishman
already referred to was still upon the settee.he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his
burden."What's the lad been doin'?""What's he been doin', is it?He's been insultin' me to my face--that's
what the Donovans won't stand."Don't trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you.Not quite willingly, but reluctant to offend Donovan, who gave him
credit for the drinks, Barney raised a trap-door leading to the cellar
below.There was a ladder for the convenience of those wishing to ascend and
descend, but Donovan was not disposed to use much ceremony with the boy
who had offended him.He dropped him through the opening, Dan by good
luck falling on his feet."That's the best place for you, you young meddler!""You'll
find it mighty comfortable, and I wish you much joy.I won't charge you
no rint, and that's an object in these hard times--eh, Barney?""To be sure it is," said Barney; "but all the same, Donovan, I'd rather
pay rint up stairs, if I had my choice!""He hasn't the choice," said Donovan triumphantly."What's it all about now, Donovan?""He wanted to shtale my Katy," said Donovan.asked Donovan, not caring to go
into particulars.Barney indicated his choice with alacrity, and, after drinking, was
hardly in a condition to pursue his inquiries.DAN DISCOMFITS THE DONOVANS.Dan found himself at first bewildered and confused by his sudden descent
into the cellar.As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he was
able to get an idea of his surroundings.It was a common cellar with an
earthen floor.Ranged along one side was a row of kegs, some containing
whisky, others empty.Besides, there were a few boxes and odds and ends
which had been placed here to get them out of the way."Not a very cheerful-looking place," thought Dan, "though I do get it
rent free."He sat down on a box, and began to consider his position.The walls were solid, and although there was a narrow
window, consisting of a row of single panes, it was at the top of the
cellar, and not easily accessible.He might indeed reach it by the
ladder, but he would have to break the glass and crawl through, a mode
of escape likely to be attended by personal risk."No, that won't do," thought Dan."At any rate, I won't try it till
other things fail."Meanwhile Donovan, in the bar-room above, was in high good humor.He
felt that he had done a sharp thing, and more than once chuckled as he
thought of his prisoner below.Indeed he could not forbear, after about
half an hour, lifting the trap and calling down stairs:

"Hallo, there!""You're an impudent jackanapes!""You'll
get enough of it before you're through.""So will you," answered Dan, boldly."I'll take the risk," chuckled Donovan."Do you know what you remind me
of?""You're like a rat in a trap.""Not exactly," answered Dan, as a bright thought dawned upon him."Because a rat can do no harm, and I can."It occurred to Donovan that Dan might have some matches in his pocket,
and was momentarily alarmed at the thought that our hero might set the
house on fire."If you had," said the saloon-keeper, relieved, "it would do you no good
to set a fire."I don't mean to set the house on fire," said Dan, composedly.returned Dan, rising from his seat on the box.asked Donovan, following with his glance the
boy's motion."I'm going to take the spigot out of them
whisky-kegs, and let the whisky run out on the floor."exclaimed the saloon-keeper, now thoroughly
frightened.As he spoke Dan dextrously pulled the spigot from a keg, and Donovan, to
his dismay, heard the precious liquid--precious in his eyes--pouring out
upon the floor.With an exertion he raised the trap-door, hastily descended the ladder,
and rushed to the keg to replace the spigot.Meanwhile Dan ran up the ladder, pulled it after him, and made his late
jailer a captive."Put down the ladder, you young rascal!"roared Donovan, when, turning
from his work, he saw how the tables had been turned."It wouldn't be convenient just yet," answered Dan, coolly.He shut the trap-door, hastily lugged the ladder to the rear of the
house (unobserved, for there were no customers present), then dashed up
stairs and beckoned to Althea to follow him.Donovan was stupefied by liquor.Putting on her things, the little girl hastily and gladly obeyed.As they passed through the saloon, Donovan's execrations and shouts were
heard proceeding from the cellar."Never you mind, Althea," said Dan.The two children hurried to the nearest horse-car, which luckily came up
at the moment, and jumped on board.Dan looked back with a smile at the saloon, saying to himself:

"I rather think, Mr.Donovan, you've found your match this time.I hope
you'll enjoy the cellar as much as I did."In about an hour and a half Dan, holding Althea by the hand,
triumphantly led her into his mother's presence."I've brought her back, mother," he said."Oh, my dear, dear little girl!""I
thought I should never, never see you again.But we will not wait to hear a twice-told tale.Rather let us return to
Donovan, where the unhappy proprietor is still a captive in his own
cellar.Here he remained till his cries attracted the attention of a
wondering customer, who finally lifted the trap-door."What are you doin' down there?""Put down the ladder and let me up first of all."It was a considerable time before the ladder was found.Then the
saloon-keeper emerged from his prison in a very bad humor."I wish I had left you there," said the customer, with justifiable
indignation."This is your gratitude for my trouble, is it?""Excuse me, but I'm so mad with that cursed boy."Come, that's talking," said the placated customer."Wait a minute," said Donovan, a sudden fear possessing him.He rushed up stairs and looked for Althea.His wife was lying on the floor, breathing heavily, but the little girl
was gone.exclaimed Donovan,
sinking into a chair.Then, in a blind fury with the wife who didn't prevent the little girl's
recapture, he seized a pail of water and emptied it over the face of the
prostrate woman.Donovan came to, and berated her husband furiously."Serves you right, you jade!"It was certainly an unlucky day for the Donovans.After calling at Donovan's, on the day when Dan recovered Althea, John
Hartley crossed the Courtlandt street ferry, and took a train to
Philadelphia with Blake, his accomplice in the forged certificates.The
two confederates had raised some Pennsylvania railway certificates,
which they proposed to put on the Philadelphia market.They spent several days in the Quaker City, and thus Hartley heard
nothing of the child's escape.Donovan did not see fit to inform him, as this would stop the weekly
remittance for the child's board, and, moreover, draw Hartley's
indignation down upon his head.One day, in a copy of the _New York Herald_, which he purchased at the
news-stand in the Continental Hotel, Hartley observed the arrival of
Harriet Vernon at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."I thought she would come," he said to himself, with a smile."I have
her in my power at last.She must submit to my terms, or lose sight of
the child altogether.""Blake," he said, aloud, "I must take the first train to New York.""On the contrary, I see a chance of making a good haul."Vernon sat in her room at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.A servant brought up a card bearing the name of John
Hartley."He is prompt," she said to herself, with a smile."Probably he has not
heard of Althea's escape from the den to which he carried her.I will
humor him, in that case, and draw him out.""I will see the gentleman in the parlor," she said.Five minutes later she entered the ladies' parlor.Hartley rose to
receive her with a smile of conscious power, which told Harriet Vernon
that he was ignorant of the miscarriage of his plans."I heard of your _unexpected_ arrival, Mrs.Vernon," he commenced, "and
have called to pay my respects.""Your motive is appreciated, John Hartley," she said, coldly."That's pleasant," he said, mockingly."May I beg to apologize for
constraining you to cross the Atlantic?""Don't apologize; you have merely acted out your nature.""Probably that is not meant to be complimentary.However, it can't be
helped.""I suppose you have something to say to me, John Hartley," said Mrs.I wrote you that I had ferreted out your cunningly
devised place of concealment for my daughter."She seemed very cool and composed,
whereas he expected she would be angry and disturbed."We may as well come to business at once," he said."If you wish to
recover the charge of your ward, you must accede to my terms.""They are expressed in my letter to you.You must agree to pay me a
thousand dollars each quarter.""It strikes me you are exorbitant in your demands."At any rate, the money won't come out of you.It will
come from my daughter's income.""So you would rob your daughter, John Hartley?"Is
she to live in luxury, and with thousands to spare, while I, her only
living parent, wander penniless and homeless about the world.""I might sympathize with you, if I did not know how you have misused the
gifts of fortune, and embittered the existence of my poor sister.As it
is, it only disgusts me.""I don't want you sympathy, Harriet Vernon," he said, roughly."I want
four thousand dollars a year.""Suppose I decline to let you have it?""Then you must take the consequences," he said, quickly."That you and Althea will be forever separated.He looked at her intently to see the effect of his threat.Harriet Vernon was as cool and imperturbable as ever."Have you been in New York for a week past?"she asked, as he thought,
irrelevantly."Because you don't appear to know what has happened."As for me, I bid you good-evening.""I mean, John Hartley, that you are not as shrewd as you imagine.I mean
that a boy has foiled you; and while you were doubtless laughing at his
simplicity, he has proved more than a match for you.You have no claim
upon me, and I must decline your disinterested proposal."She left the room, leaving him crest-fallen and stupefied.He started for Brooklyn immediately, and toward eleven o'clock entered
the saloon at Donovan's."She's gone," he cried, "but I couldn't help it, Mr.On my
honor, I couldn't."The story was told, Donovan ending by invoking curses upon the boy who
had played such a trick upon him."I am ashamed of you, for
allowing a boy to get the best of you.""That boy's a fox," said Donovan."He's a match for the old one, he is.I'd like to break his neck for him."I may get hold of the girl again," mused Hartley, as
he rose to go."If I do, I won't put her in charge of such a
dunderhead."He left Donovan's and returned to New York, but he had hardly left the
Fulton ferry-boat when he was tapped on the shoulder by an officer."A little financial irregularity, as they call it in Wall street.You
may know something about some raised railroad certificates!"The morning papers contained an account of John Hartley's arrest, and
the crime with which he was charged.Harriet Vernon read it at the breakfast-table with an interest which may
be imagined."I don't like to rejoice in any man's misfortune," she said to herself,
"but now I can have a few years of peace.My precious brother-in-law
will doubtless pass the next few years in enforced seclusion, and I can
have a settled home."Directly after breakfast, she set out for the humble home of her niece.She found all at home, for Dan was not to go back to business till
Monday."Well, my good friend," she said, "I have news for you.""Good news, I hope," said Dan.Henceforth I can have Althea with me.The obstacle that
separated us is removed."Mordaunt's countenance fell, and Dan looked sober.It was plain
that Althea was to be taken from them, and they had learned to love her."I am very glad," faltered Mrs."You don't look glad," returned Mrs."You see we don't like to part with Althea," explained Dan, who
understood his mother's feelings."Who said you were to part with the child?""I thought you meant to take her from us."Your mistake is a natural one, for I have not told you my
plans.I mean to take a house up town, install Mrs.Mordaunt as my
housekeeper and friend, and adopt this young man (indicating Dan),
provided he has no objection."I have plenty of money, and no one to care for, or to
care for me.I have taken a fancy to you all, and I am quite sure that
we can all live happily together.Althea is my niece, and you, Dan, may
call me aunt, too, if you like.Dan offered her his hand in a frank, cordial way, which she liked."So it is settled, then," she said, in a pleased voice."I ought to warn
you," she added, "that I have the reputation of being ill-tempered.You
may get tired of living with me.""We'll take the risk," said Dan, smiling.Vernon, whose habit it was to act promptly, engaged a house on
Madison avenue, furnished it without regard to expense, and in less than
a fortnight, installed her friends in it.Then she had a talk with Dan
about his plans."Do you wish to remain in your place," she asked, "or would you like to
obtain a better education first?""To obtain an education," said Dan, promptly."Then give notice to your employer of your intention."Vernon in a second interview informed him that besides defraying
his school expenses, she should give him an allowance of fifty dollars a
month for his own personal needs."May I give a part of it to my mother?""You don't ask why I refuse," she said."I suppose you have a good reason," said Dan, dubiously."My reason is that I shall pay your mother double this sum.Unless she
is very extravagant it ought to be enough to defray her expenses."exclaimed Dan, in fresh
astonishment.All these important changes in the position of the Mordaunts were
unknown to their old friends, who, since their loss of property, had
given them the cold shoulder.One day Tom Carver, in passing the house, saw Dan coming down the steps
quite as handsomely dressed as himself."I didn't know what else could carry you to such a house.""Oh, that's easily explained," said Dan."You don't mean to say she boards there?"asked Tom, in a more deferential tone.At any rate she gives me a handsome allowance.""And you don't have anything to do?""Why, my father only
allows me three dollars a week."I don't need as much as my aunt allows me.""I say, Dan," said Tom, in the most friendly terms, "I'm awfully hard
up."Yes," said Dan, secretly amused with the change in Tom's manner.said Tom, linking his arm in Dan's."I'm very glad you're rich again."Thank you," said Dan, smiling, "but I'm afraid you have forgotten
something.""You know I used to be a newsboy in front of the Astor House.""And you might not care to associate with a newsboy.""Well, you are all right now," said Tom, magnanimously."You didn't always think so, Tom.""I always thought you were a gentleman, Dan."I suppose it's the way of the world," thought Dan."It is lucky that
there are some true friends who stick by us through thick and thin."Mordaunt had an experience similar to Dan's.Her old acquaintances,
who, during her poverty never seemed to recognize her when they met,
gradually awoke to the consciousness of her continued existence, and
left cards.She received them politely, but rated their professions of
friendship at their true value.They had not been "friends in need," and
she could not count them "friends indeed."Six years rolled by, bringing with them many changes.The little family
on Madison avenue kept together.She had a hearty love for young people, and enjoyed the growth and
development of her niece Althea, and Dan, whom she called her nephew and
loved no less.He completed his preparation for college, and
graduated with high honors.He is no less frank, handsome, and
self-reliant than when as a boy he sold papers in front of the Astor
House for his mother's support.He looks forward to a business life, and
has accepted an invitation to go abroad to buy goods in London and Paris
for his old firm.He was, in fact, preparing to go when a mysterious
letter was put in his hands.It ran thus:


     "MR.DANIEL MORDAUNT:--I shall take it as a great favor if you will
     come to the St.Nicholas Hotel this evening, and inquire for me.I
     am sick, or I would not trouble you.I have to speak
     to you on a matter of great importance."I don't know of any one of that name."I cannot think of any one," said Mrs."I hope you won't go,
Dan," she added, anxiously; "it may be a trap laid by a wicked and
designing man.""You forget that I am not a boy any longer, mother," said Dan, smiling."I think I can defend myself, even if Mr.Davis is a wicked and
designing person."To her he was
still a boy, though in the eyes of others an athletic young man.Davis at the hotel, Dan was ushered into a room on
the third floor.Seated in an arm-chair was an elderly man, weak and
wasted, apparently in the last stages of consumption."It would have been well if he had not known me, for I did him a great
wrong."said Dan, trying to connect the name with his
father.You see before you Robert Hunting, once your
father's book-keeper."Dan's handsome face darkened, and he said, bitterly:

"You killed my father!""Heaven help me, I fear I did!"sighed Davis--to call him by his later
name."The money of which you robbed him caused him to fail, and failure led
to his death.""I have accused myself of this crime oftentimes," moaned Davis."Don't
think that the money brought happiness, for it did not."From Europe I went to
Brazil, and engaged in business in Rio Janeiro.A year since I found my
health failing, and have come back to New York to die.But before I die
I want to make what reparation I can.""You cannot call my father back to me," said Dan, sadly."No; but I can restore the money that I stole.That is the right
word--stole.I hope you and your mother have not suffered?""We saw some hard times, but for years we have lived in comfort."Will you bring a lawyer to me to-morrow evening?"You might keep every dollar if you would bring my father back."The next evening Davis transferred to Dan and his mother property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, in payment of what he had taken,
with interest, and in less than a month later he died, Dan taking upon
himself the charge of the funeral.His trip to Europe was deferred, and
having now capital to contribute, he was taken as junior partner into
the firm where he had once filled the position of office-boy.His father had failed disastrously, and
Tom is glad to accept a minor clerkship from the boy at whom he once
sneered.Julia Rogers has never lost her preference for Dan.It is whispered that
they are engaged, or likely soon to be, and Dan's assiduous attentions
to the young lady make the report a plausible one.John Hartley was sentenced to a term of years in prison.Harriet Vernon
dreaded the day of his release, being well convinced that he would seize
the earliest opportunity to renew his persecutions.She had about made
up her mind to buy him off, when she received intelligence that he was
carried off by fever, barely a month before the end of his term.It was
a sad end of a bad life, but she could not regret him.Althea was saved
the knowledge of her father's worthlessness.She was led to believe that
he had died when she was a little girl.Dan, the young detective, has entered
upon a career of influence and prosperity.The hardships of his earlier
years contributed to strengthen his character, and give him that
self-reliance of which the sons of rich men so often stand in need.A
similar experience might have benefited Tom Carver, whose lofty
anticipations have been succeeded by a very humble reality.Let those
boys who are now passing through the discipline of poverty and
privation, take courage and emulate the example of "Dan, the Detective."A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS

BY POPULAR WRITERS,

97-99-101 Reade Street, New York.+Bonnie Prince Charlie+: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.The
boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite
agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and
serves with the French army at Dettingen.He kills his father's foe in a
duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince
Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland."Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.'The
     lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up
     as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read.For freshness
     of treatment and variety of incident Mr.Henty has surpassed
     himself."--_Spectator._


     +With Clive in India+; or, the Beginnings of an Empire.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme.At its
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the
native princes.At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the
greater part of Southern India.The author has given a full and accurate
account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges
follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his
narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike
interest to the volume."He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital
     importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story
     which of itself is deeply interesting.Young people assuredly will
     be delighted with the volume."--_Scotsman._


     +The Lion of the North+: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of
     Religion.With full-page Illustrations by JOHN
     SCHÖNBERG.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War.The issue had its importance, which has extended to
the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany.The
army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen,
and among these was the hero of the story."The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys
     may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to
     be profited."--_Times._


     +The Dragon and the Raven+; or, The Days of King Alfred.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between
Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of
the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of
the sea-wolves.The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the
battles fought by King Alfred.He is driven from his home, takes to the
sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by
them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris."Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish
     reader."--_Athenæum._


     +The Young Carthaginian+: A Story of the Times of Hannibal.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest.That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but
took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge.To
let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the
world Mr.Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic
style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history,
but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the
reader.From first to last nothing
     stays the interest of the narrative.It bears us along as on a
     stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its
     force."--_Saturday Review._


     +In Freedom's Cause+: A Story of Wallace and Bruce.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War
of Independence.The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace
and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed
at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages.The
researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a
living, breathing man--and a valiant champion.The hero of the tale
fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical
accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth'scapes" and wild adventure."It is written in the author's best style.Full of the wildest and
     most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which
     a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one
     side."--_The Schoolmaster._


     +With Lee in Virginia+: A Story of the American Civil War.By G. A.

     price $1.00.The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his
sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage
and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of
the struggle.He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded
and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two
cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he
had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties."One of the best stories for lads which Mr.The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and
     romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal
     interest and charm of the story."--_Standard._

     cloth, price $1.50.The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the
magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most
romantic and daring exploits in history.With this as the groundwork of
his story Mr.Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth,
Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had
sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the
Spaniards in the New World.He is beset by many perils among the
natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the
devotion of an Aztec princess.At last by a ruse he obtains the
protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in
regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride."'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly
     successful historical tale that Mr.Henty has yet

     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._

eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._

     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._

that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after

Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject
stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.+The Bravest of the Brave+; or, With Peterborough in Spain.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are
     quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._

service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of
Bubastes.In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests
with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and
daughter."The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
     cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
     skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures.It is
     admirably illustrated."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Washington at Monmouth+: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a
boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story
abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the
glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has
not been hastily done, or without considerable study.+For the Temple+: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem.With full-page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and
attractive story.The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of
the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form
the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of
the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes
the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the
Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his
Galilean home with the favor of Titus.Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
     resistance to Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the
     famous wars of the world."--_Graphic._

     Mines.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00."Facing Death" is a story with a purpose.It is intended to show that a
lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in
life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to
carry out his determination, is sure to succeed.The hero of the story
is a typical British boy, dogged, earnest, generous, and though
"shamefaced" to a degree, is ready to face death in the discharge of
duty."The tale is well written and well illustrated and there is much
     reality in the characters.If any father, clergyman, or
     schoolmaster is on the lookout for a good book to give as a present
     to a boy who is worth his salt, this is the book we would
     recommend."--_Standard._

botanist and naturalist of herculean strength and unfailing nerve and
humor.In the adventures among the Maoris, there are many breathless
moments in which the odds seem hopelessly against the party, but they
succeed in establishing themselves happily in one of the pleasant New
Zealand valleys."Brimful of adventure, of humorous and interesting conversation,
     and vivid pictures of colonial life."--_Schoolmaster._


     +Julian Mortimer+: A Brave Boy's Struggle for Home and Fortune.By
     HARRY CASTLEMON.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Here is a story that will warm every boy's heart.There is mystery
enough to keep any lad's imagination wound up to the highest pitch.The
scene of the story lies west of the Mississippi River, in the days when
emigrants made their perilous way across the great plains to the land of
gold.One of the startling features of the book is the attack upon the
wagon train by a large party of Indians.Our hero is a lad of uncommon
nerve and pluck, a brave young American in every sense of the word.He
enlists and holds the reader's sympathy from the outset.Surrounded by
an unknown and constant peril, and assisted by the unswerving fidelity
of a stalwart trapper, a real rough diamond, our hero achieves the most
happy results.Harry Castlemon has written many entertaining stories for
boys, and it would seem almost superfluous to say anything in his
praise, for the youth of America regard him as a favorite author."+Carrots+:" Just a Little Boy.With
     Illustrations by WALTER CRANE."One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our
     good fortune to meet with for some time.Carrots and his sister are

     greedily.Children are first-rate critics, and thoroughly
     appreciate Walter Crane's illustrations."--_Punch._


     +Mopsa the Fairy.+ By JEAN INGELOW.Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living
     writers for children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of
     pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks.It
     requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of
     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._


     +A Jaunt Through Java+: The Story of a Journey to the Sacred
     Mountain.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The central interest of this story is found in the thrilling adventures
of two cousins, Hermon and Eustace Hadley, on their trip across the
island of Java, from Samarang to the Sacred Mountain.In a land where
the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large; where the rhinoceros and other
fierce beasts are to be met with at unexpected moments; it is but
natural that the heroes of this book should have a lively experience.Hermon not only distinguishes himself by killing a full-grown tiger at
short range, but meets with the most startling adventure of the journey.There is much in this narrative to instruct as well as entertain the
reader, and so deftly has Mr.Ellis used his material that there is not
a dull page in the book.The two heroes are brave, manly young fellows,
bubbling over with boyish independence.They cope with the many
difficulties that arise during the trip in a fearless way that is bound
to win the admiration of every lad who is so fortunate as to read their
adventures.+Wrecked on Spider Island+; or, How Ned Rogers Found the Treasure.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A "down-east" plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from love of
adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by which he can
gain a livelihood.While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the
captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the
brig in order to gain the insurance.Once it is known he is in
possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island,
explaining to the crew that the boy is afflicted with leprosy.While
thus involuntarily playing the part of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck
submerged in the sand, and overhauling the timbers for the purpose of
gathering material with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount
of treasure.Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping
there a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to seize
the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and, as a
matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all serve to
make as entertaining a story of sea-life as the most captious boy could
desire.+Geoff and Jim+: A Story of School Life.Illustrated
     by A. G. WALKER."This is a prettily told story of the life spent by two motherless
     bairns at a small preparatory school.Both Geoff and Jim are very

     gets into and the trials he endures will no doubt, interest a large
     circle of young readers."--_Church Times._

     and the book tastefully bound and well
     illustrated."--_Schoolmaster._

     boys."--_Standard._


     +The Castaways+; or, On the Florida Reefs, By JAMES OTIS.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.It is just the kind of story that the
majority of boys yearn for.From the moment that the Sea Queen dispenses
with the services of the tug in lower New York bay till the breeze
leaves her becalmed off the coast of Florida, one can almost hear the
whistle of the wind through her rigging, the creak of her straining
cordage as she heels to the leeward, and feel her rise to the
snow-capped waves which her sharp bow cuts into twin streaks of foam.Off Marquesas Keys she floats in a dead calm.Ben Clark, the hero of the
story, and Jake, the cook, spy a turtle asleep upon the glassy surface
of the water.They determine to capture him, and take a boat for that
purpose, and just as they succeed in catching him a thick fog cuts them
off from the vessel, and then their troubles begin.They take refuge on
board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they are cast ashore upon a
low sandy key.Their adventures from this point cannot fail to charm the
reader.His
style is captivating, and never for a moment does he allow the interest
to flag.In "The Castaways" he is at his best.+Tom Thatcher's Fortune.+ By HORATIO ALGER, JR.12mo, cloth, price

days afterward Tom learns that which induces him to start overland for
California with the view of probing the family mystery.Ultimately he returns to his native village, bringing
consternation to the soul of John Simpson, who only escapes the
consequences of his villainy by making full restitution to the man whose
friendship he had betrayed.The story is told in that entertaining way
which has made Mr.Alger's name a household word in so many homes.+Birdie+: A Tale of Child Life.By H. L. CHILDE-PEMBERTON.Illustrated by H. W. RAINEY."The story is quaint and simple, but there is a freshness about it
     that makes one hear again the ringing laugh and the cheery shout of
     children at play which charmed his earlier years."--_New York
     Express._

was expected from boys in the Colonial days.The lads, after no slight
amount of adventure, are sent as messengers--not soldiers--into the
south to find the troops under Lafayette.Once with that youthful
general they are given employment as spies, and enter the British camp,

adventures of Ben Jaffreys and Ned Allen he is acquiring a fund of
historical lore which will remain in his memory long after that which he
has memorized from text-books has been forgotten.+Lost in the Cañon+: Sam Willett's Adventures on the Great Colorado.By ALFRED R. CALHOUN.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.This story hinges on a fortune left to Sam Willett, the hero, and the

and the greater part was received during my time.I do not know why
this was not collected before; perhaps it was due to the departure
of the late Mr.Blom to the pearl fishery in 1699, and his death
soon thereafter.[21] Because, when I arrived in December of the
same year from Batavia, I found matters in Jaffnapatam very much in
the same condition in which they were on my return from Colombo last
August, namely, many necessary things had been neglected and there was
great confusion.I will not enter into details over the matter here,
as I am not writing with direct reference to them.We will return
now to the subject of the Oely service, with regard to which I have
merely to add that it must be seen that the old and infirm people,
who are exempted from this servitude in the new Thombo, do not fail to
deliver such mats and pannegay [22] kernels for coals for the smith's
shop, as they are bound to according to the customs of the country;
because, although this is only a small matter, yet these things come
in very handy for the storehouses, vessels, pearl fishery, &c., while
otherwise money would have to be spent on these mats, an expenditure
which could be thus avoided.(14)

The tax collectors and Majoraals are native officers appointed by
the Company to demand and collect the poll tax, land rent, tithes,
and the Officie and Adigary rates which I have treated of above.They
also see that the natives perform such servitudes as they owe to
the lord of the land, and collect the Sicos money to which I have
referred, levied for neglect in attending for Oely service.The
expenditure in the appointment of these native officers is very
small, as may be seen from the foregoing account, considering that
these Collectors and Majoraals have to attend once in three months,
or four times a year, at the Castle to hand over one-fourth of the
full amount of the taxes for the year; so that the revenue is usually
received at the closing of the accounts.As this practice has proved
to be successful, the same course must be followed in future.I would
wish at the same time to point out here that the facility with which
these taxes are collected in Jaffnapatam is another evidence of the
improved condition of the inhabitants.In the year 1690 a change
was made in the appointment of the Collectors and Majoraals.Up to
that time all these and many of the Cannecappuls, Arachchies, &c.,
belonged to one caste, viz., that of the Bellales, being the farmers
or peasants.The principal of these belong to the family of Don Philip
Sangerepulle, from Cannengray, a native of evil repute; so much so,
that His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor of India, Laurens Pyl,
who was at the time Governor of Ceylon, issued an order on June 16,
1687, by which Commandeur Cornelis van der Duyn and his Council were
instructed to have the said Don Philip and several of his followers
and accomplices put in chains and sent to Colombo.He succeeded,
however, in concealing himself and eventually fled to Nagapatam, where
he managed to influence the merchant Babba Porboe to such an extent
that through his aid he obtained during the years 1689 and 1690 all
the advantages he desired for his caste and for his followers.This
went so far as to the appointment of even schoolboys as Majoraals
and Cayaals from the time they left school.His late Excellency van
Mydregt, who had great confidence in the said Babba, was somewhat
misled by him, but was informed of the fact by certain private letters
from the late Commandeur Blom during His Excellency's residence at
Tutucorin.Blom on July 4, 1690,
to at once make such changes as would be necessary, under the pretext
that some of the Majoraals were not provided yet with proper acts of
appointment issued by His Excellency.This may also be seen in the
answer to some points brought before His Excellency by Mr.Finding,
however, on my arrival from Batavia, that these appointments were
still reserved for the Bellales, through the influence of a certain
Moddely Tamby, who had formerly been a betel carrier to Sangerepulle,
later on a private servant of Babba Porboe, and last of all Cannecappul
to the Commandeur, and another Cannecappul, also of the Bellale caste
and a first cousin of the said Sangerepulle, of the name of Don Joan
Mandala Nayaga Mudaliyar, I brought this difficulty before my Governor
His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor of India, Thomas van
Rhee, on my visit to Colombo in the beginning of 1698.He verbally
authorized me to make the necessary changes, that so many thousands
of people should no longer suffer by the oppression of the Bellales,
who are very proud and despise all other castes, and who had become
so powerful that they were able not only to worry and harass the poor
people, but also to prevent them from submitting their complaints to
the authorities.Already in the years 1673 and 1675 orders had been
given that the Collectors should be transferred every three years;
because by their holding office for many years in the same Province
they obtained a certain amount of influence and authority over the
inhabitants, which would have enabled them to take advantage of them;
and it has always been a rule here not to restrict the appointment
to these offices to the Bellales, but to employ the Maddapallys
and other castes as well, to serve as a counter-acting influence;
because by this means the inhabitants were kept in peace, and through
the jealousy of the various castes the ruler was always in a position
to know what was going on in the country.All these reasons induced
His Excellency Thomas van Rhee to give me leave to bring about the
necessary changes, which have now been introduced.I appointed the
Collector of Waddemoraatje as my Cannecappul in the place of Moddely
Tamby, whose place I filled with the new Collector of the Maddapally
caste, while also a new Collector was appointed for Timmoraatsche
in the place of Don Joan Mandala Nayaga, whom the late Mr.Blom had
discharged from his office as Cannecappul of the Gate; because no two
Bellales are allowed to hold office in one place.He agreed with me on
this point, as may be seen from his report of August 20, 1692.I have
further transferred two Collectors in the large Province of Wallegamo,
so as to gradually bring about the desired change in the interest of
the Company and that of the other castes; but I heard that this small
change created so much disturbance and canvassing that I had to leave
the matter alone.The Bellales, seeing that they would be shut out from
these profitable offices and that they would lose the influence they
possessed so far, and being the largest in number and the wealthiest of
the people, moved heaven and earth to put a stop to the carrying into
effect of this plan so prejudicial to their interests.With this view
they also joined the Wannias Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar
Ilengenarene Mudaliyar in their conspiracies.The latter two, also
Bellales, well aware that they owed many elephants to the Company,
as stated at the beginning of this Memoir, and knowing that their
turn would also come, organized the riots in which the said Moddely
Tamby was the principal instrument.He was a man who first appeared
as a rebel, on the plea that, having been prosecuted by the Fiscaal
for many offences, he had been injured by a long imprisonment and
that this induced him to take revenge, these same two Wannias having
been then the first accusers who came to me complaining against this
man in the latter part of 1694.Perhaps later on they considered the
great assistance they received from him during the time of Babba
Porboe in obtaining the various privileges and favours.They also
probably understood that it was my intention to diminish the influence
of the Bellale caste, and were thus induced to take this course to
promote the welfare of their caste.I think that it was also out of
their conspiracies that the riots arose from which this Commandement
suffered during my absence in the months of May, June, and July.I
cannot account for them in any other way, as I have stated previously
when treating of the Wanni.I am obliged to repeat this here, in
order that Your Honours may be on your guard and watch the movements,
alliances, and associations of these Bellales and the Majoraals of the
Wanni; because although I may have persisted in bringing about the
desired changes, I preferred to leave the matter alone, seeing how
much annoyance this first attempt caused me, and how the obsequious
subjects of this Commandement are not only given audience in Colombo,
but are also upheld against their local ruler, whose explanation is
not only not asked for, but who is even prevented from defending the
interests of the Company at the place he had a right to do.I will,
however, drop this subject, although a great deal more might be said,
because I consider it will be useless to do so.I only advise Your
Honours not to make the slightest alteration in the appointment of the
native officers during my residence at Mallabaar, but to leave them
for the present in the state in which they wish so much to remain,
as this is a matter within the province of the Commandeur.Lascoreens
and Arachchies with their Canganes may, however, be discharged or
appointed according to their merits by the Dessave, in accordance
with the instructions of the late Admiral Rycloff van Goens, dated
February 26, 1661.In the case, however, of any of the Majoraals,
[23] Cayaals, [24] Pattangatyns, [25] Cannecappuls, or Collectors
resigning their offices or of being dismissed on account of misconduct,
the Dessave will be also authorized to provisionally appoint others
in their place without issuing the actens [26] until my return or
until the appointment of another Commandeur in my place, if such be
the intention of Their Excellencies at Batavia.Because no provision
has been made for such cases, which interrupt the regular course of
the administration.(15)

It must be also seen that the lower castes observe the rules with
regard to their costumes, &c., because I hear that here also corruption
has crept in, and that they do not wear their dress in the proper way,
do not cut their hair, and do not wear any golden rings in their ears,
so that they cannot be distinguished from the caste-people or Gonoradas
as they are called, who consider this an insult to them.A plackaat
on this subject was issued by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, Governor
of Ceylon, on August 18, 1686.There will be little difficulty in
enforcing those rules if the Regent in this Commandement is allowed to
assume the authority which is his right, and which he must have if he
is to maintain the discipline required to carry on the operations of
the Company, for the people of Jaffnapatam are conceited, arrogant,
and stubborn.They bring false complaints against their rulers to the
higher powers if they find but the least encouragement, while on the
other hand they are slavish and cringe under the rod of their rulers so
long as they see that their authority is not disputed, but is upheld
by the Government.As they were so strictly held down to their duties
during the time of the heathen and of the Portuguese, not knowing any
other but their own immediate ruler, they often do not understand
the position of a subordinate ruler in the service of the Company,
and are not able to act with discretion when they find a way from
an inferior to a superior.It is not in accordance with the natural
government to which their ancestors had been accustomed.It must not,
however, be supposed that I ignore the fact that the mild government of
the Company always leaves a way of appeal for those of its subjects,
whoever they may be, when they consider themselves unjustly treated;
but I think that on the other hand the Company should likewise allow
their chiefs to punish the delinquents before they are permitted to
appeal to the higher powers.This I have found is not always observed
as regards Jaffnapatam, although it seems to me necessary that it
should be if our officers are not in the course of time to become a
laughing stock to the people.It is a well-known fact that the more
influential natives always try to oppress the poorer classes, and it
will be impossible to prevent their doing this if they are allowed
to become stronger than they already are.The Lascoreens, who are supposed to be soldiers, appear however to be
more useful in times of peace for the running of errands, the carrying
of letters, the communication of orders to and fro in the country,
and to summon the inhabitants, than they are in times of war for
the carrying of arms, for they have not the slightest idea of drill
or discipline, and are entirely wanting in courage.Yet we have to
employ them in these services, and it will be chiefly the duty of
the Dessave to see that those whose names are entered as Lascoreens
in the Hoofd Thombo are kept under discipline by their officers, and
also that their number is complete, so that they may be easily found
when suddenly wanted.It must also be observed that no men are entered
as Lascoreens who are bound to perform other services.The argument
brought forward by His late Excellency Commissioner van Mydregt in
his Instructions for Jaffnapatam of November 29, 1690, that it is
most difficult to reduce such people afterwards to their more humble
service is undoubtedly true and has been proved by experience.Those
whose names are at present entered in the Thombo as Lascoreens amount
to 834 men, both archers and pikemen, viz.:--


                Arachchies                    31
                Canganas                       4
                Lascoreens                   799
                                             ===
                                   Total     834


Of these, only 200 are paid, and sometimes less than that
number, according to circumstances, as may be seen in the monthly
accounts.They are commanded by two Mudaliyars, one over the archers
and one over the pikemen.The Lascoreens are paid only 7 1/5 fanams
per mensem, without rice, and they are required to be ready day
and night to carry orders.Their pay is certainly not too high,
especially in such times of dearth as we have had during the last
three or four years, but I hope that this may be prevented in future
to some extent when the Moors from Bengal come here more frequently
and the rice from Trincomalee and Cotjaar is received in the required
quantities.Otherwise I think that the request of the Lascoreens,
if they strongly urge it, should be complied with, namely, that they
may be paid Rd.1 per month should the dearth continue longer.But
this can only be done with the special permission of His Excellency
the Governor and the Council of Colombo, although the Commandeur
and the Council here have been authorized to grant this higher pay
by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, Councillor of India, on his visit to
Jaffnapatam on June 14, 1687, when this and other requests of the
natives were submitted to him.But, considering that besides the
180 or 200 Lascoreens there are also employed other native soldiers
in Mannar, Aripo, Calpentyn, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, who are
also drawn from the above-mentioned 834 men, and that they have to
be transferred every half year, it is desirable that the same rules
should apply to them all, especially because a number of them are
also employed in this Commandement in the felling of wood, some at
Point Pedro under the Vidaan of the Elephants, some at Kayts in the
dyeing industry, some under the Civil Council, others again under
the Collectors of taxes in the various Provinces, at the Passes,
under the clergy, the Fiscaal, and other of the Company's servants;
since in that way they will be best kept under discipline.This would
also prevent fraud, because each person would receive his pay direct
from the Company, while at present the two Mudaliyars mentioned above
have a chance of favouring those whom they prefer.For this and other
reasons Your Honours must see that the Lascoreens are transferred at
least once a year, if not twice.[16]

Slaves from the opposite coast are brought here in large numbers,
because the accounts state that from December 1, 1694, to the end of
November, 1696, no less than 3,589 slaves were brought across, on each
of whom was paid to the Company as duty for admittance the amount of 11
fanams, making a total of 39,424 fanams or 9,856 guilders.The people
of Jaffnapatam import these slaves only for their own advantage, as
they find the sale of these creatures more profitable than the trade
in rice or nely, these grain being at present very dear in Coromandel,
which again is a reason why these slaves are very cheap there, being
procurable almost for a handful of rice.As Jaffnapatam does not yield
a sufficient quantity of rice for its large population, I tried to
induce the inhabitants to import as much nely as possible, but to no
purpose.Therefore, considering that it is likely the scarcity of the
necessaries of life will increase rather than decrease, because the
Moorish vessels loaded with rice remained at Madraspatam, I thought
it best to open the passage to Trincomalee and Batticaloa for the
inhabitants of Jaffnapatam.I did so because I was informed that grain
is very plentiful there and may be had at a low price, and also because
I found that this privilege had been granted to them already by the
Honourable the Supreme Government of India by Resolution of November,
1681.This permission was renewed in a letter of December 12, 1695,
but as this was cancelled in a letter from Colombo to Jaffnapatam
of January 6, 1696, this Commandement continued to suffer from the
scarcity of provisions.However, the price of rice was never higher
than Rd.1 a parra, and even came down to 6 fanams for a cut parra,
of which there are 75 in a last of 3,000 lb.The question arises,
however, whether the Company might not be greatly inconvenienced
by the importation of these slaves, because it seems to me that the
scarcity of victuals would be thus increased, and I do not consider it
advisable for other reasons also.It is true that the Company receives
a considerable amount as duty, but on the other hand these slaves
have to be fed, and thus the price of victuals will, of necessity,
advance.The people of Jaffnapatam are besides by nature lazy and
indolent, and will gradually get more accustomed to send their
slaves for the performance of their duties instead of attending to
them themselves, while moreover these slaves are in various ways
enticed outside the Province and captured by the Wannias, who in
times of peace employ them for sowing and mowing, and in times of war
strengthen their ranks with them.They also sometimes send them to
officers of the Kandyan Court in order to obtain their favour.Many
of the slaves imported suffer from chicken pox, which may cause an
epidemic among the natives, resulting in great mortality.The amount
derived from the duty on importation of slaves would therefore not
be a sufficient compensation.In my opinion this large importation
of slaves is also another evidence of the greater prosperity of the
inhabitants of this Commandement, as the purchase and maintenance of
slaves require means.[17]

Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting in
Jaffnapatam, and, as the matter is one which concerns the maintenance
of life, great attention must be paid to it if we are to continue to
exact from the inhabitants the dues they are paying now.It will be
found on calculation from the notes of the Tarrego [27] taken for
some years that the inhabitants consume on an average no less than
2,000 lasts of rice a year in addition to the quantity produced in the
Provinces, The Islands, the Wanni, Ponneryn, and Mantotte, so that it
is clear how necessary it is that the inhabitants are not only enabled
but also encouraged to import grain from outside.Besides that obtained
from the Bengal Moors, they may now also obtain rice from Tanjauwen,
Oriza, Tondy, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, as the latter passage has
been re-opened by order of the Honourable the Supreme Government of
India at Batavia in terms of their letter of July 3, 1696, which I
published in a mandate in Dutch and Mallabaar on October 1, 1696.From
this I expect good results in future for this Commandement.I also
hope that this will be a means of preventing the undesirable monopoly
of victuals, with regard to which subject I refer Your Honours to the
letter from Colombo of November 16, 1696, and the reply from here
of December 12 following, and I again seriously recommend to Your
Honours' attention this subject of monopoly, without any regard to
persons, as the greatest offences are undoubtedly those which affect
the general welfare.(18)

The native trade is confined to articles of little importance, which,
however, yield them a considerable profit, as many of the articles
found here are not found elsewhere.Thus, for instance, the palmyra
tree is not only very useful to them, as its fruit serves them as
food instead of rice, but they also obtain from it sugar, poenat, [28]
pannangay, [29] calengen, [30] mats, carsingos, [31] and caddigans [32]
or olas, and besides, the palmyra timber comes very handy whenever they
fell the trees.For all these sundries the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam
obtain good prices in Coromandel and Tondy, where also they sell
coconuts, kayer, [33] oil obtained from coconuts, and margosy, and
many other things which are not found in the places mentioned above,
or in Trincomalee and Batticaloa.These articles are rising in price
from year to year, so that they fetch two and three per cent.more
than formerly, and on this account the number of vessels along the
seacoast between Point Pedro and Kayts has increased to threefold
their number.With a view to prevent the monopoly of grain as much as
possible Your Honours are recommended to follow the same method I did,
viz., to order all vessels which come into Point Pedro, Tellemanaar,
or Wallewitte to go on to Kayts, as the owners often try to land in
these places under some pretext or other.They must be made to sell
their nely at the bangsaal or the public market, which is under the
supervision of this Castle; because if they unload their nely elsewhere
they do not bring it to the market, and the people not finding any
there have to obtain it from them at any price, which I consider to
be making a monopoly of it.Another product which yields a profit to
the inhabitants is tobacco.This grows here very abundantly, and the
greater part of it is sold by the owners without the least risk to the
merchants of Mallabaar, while the rest is sold here among their own
people or to the Company's servants.A part also is sent to Negapatam,
because the passage to Mallabaar is too dangerous for them on account
of the Bargareese pirates, who infest the neighbourhood.They also
make a good profit out of the provisions which the Company's servants
have to buy from them, such as fowls, butter, milk, sheep, piesang,
[34] soursop, betel, oil, &c., on which articles these officers have
to spend a good deal of their salaries, and even the native officers
have to devote a great deal of their pay to the purchase of these.The
inhabitants are also able to obtain a good deal as wages for labour if
they are not too lazy to work, so that, taking all in all, Your Honours
will find that the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam are more prosperous now
than they have been for some time, although it has been urged in some
quarters that they are oppressed and fleeced and are therefore in a
miserable condition.These people do not know or pretend not to know
that those reports have been circulated by some of the wealthiest
Bellales, because endeavours were made to maintain and uphold the
poorer castes against them.Their circumstances being so much better,
the people of Jaffnapatam ought not to hope for a decrease of the
tithes, as spoken of before.Nor did they ask for this during my
time, nor even referred to it, because at the general paresse [35]
of August 2, 1685, they made a unanimous declaration that they had
no request to make and no reason for complaint, and that they were
perfectly satisfied with the rule of the Company.This may be seen
in the Compendium of the last of November of the same year.In my
questions of January 22 of the same year several requests of theirs
had already been submitted, which had been all disposed of to their
satisfaction, as, for instance, that with regard to the free trade
in Batticaloa and Trincomalee already mentioned above, while the
other matters will be treated of later on.Blom would seem to recommend the decrease of the tithes in his
report of August 20, 1692, but he did not know at the time that so many
privileges would be granted to them.Although the granting of these is
of little importance to the Company, it is a fact on the other hand
that the prosperity of the inhabitants will also be an advantage to
the Company, because it enables them to pay their imposts and taxes
regularly, as witness the last few years.[19]

The coconut trees are the third source of prosperity granted to the
inhabitants, besides the free trade in Batticaloa and Trincomalee
and the reduced poll tax; because, in compliance with the orders from
Batavia of December 12, 1695, these trees would no longer be subject
to taxes in the new Land Thombo, the owners being obliged to feed not
only the Company's elephants, but also those which have been already
purchased by the merchants, with coconut leaves.Although this no
doubt is more profitable to them, as they are paid for the leaves
by the merchants, yet it is true that the trees yield less fruit
when their nourishment is spent on the leaves.But although Their
Excellencies at Batavia kindly relieved the people of their burden
in this respect, the duty was imposed again in another way when His
Excellency the Governor and the Council decided, in their letter of
October 13, that Jaffnapatam would have to deliver yearly no less
than 24 casks of coconut oil besides that which is required for use
in this Commandement and at Manaar.This, including what is required
at the pearl fishery, amounts according to my calculation to no less
than 12 casks.For this reason it will be necessary to prohibit the
export of coconuts.This order, like the one with regard to the reform
in the sale of elephants, was sent to us without previous consultation
with the Commandeur or the Council of Jaffnapatam; yet in the interest
of the Company I could not abstain from expressing my opinion on the
subject in my reply of November 1, 1696; but as the order was repeated
in a subsequent letter from Colombo as also in one of the 21st of
the same month, although with some slight alteration, I am obliged to
recommend that Your Honours should endeavour to put this order into
execution as far as possible, and not issue licenses to any one.I
do so although I expect not only that the farmer of the Alfandigo
(for the export of all articles permitted to be exported) will
complain on this account, and will pay less rent in future, but also,
and especially that the inhabitants will object to this regulation,
because they receive at least twice as much for the plain coconuts
as for the oil which they will have to deliver to the Company.This
will be so in spite of some concessions which have been made already
in the payment for the oil, upon their petition of June 14, 1687,
submitted to His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then Governor of Ceylon,
in which they stated that it was a great disadvantage to them to be
obliged to give the olas of their trees as food for the elephants,
and that they were now also prevented from selling their fruits,
but had to press oil out of these for the Company.[20]

The iron and steel tools imported by the Company did not yield much
profit, because there was no demand for them.The wealthy people
considered them too expensive, and the poor could not afford to
purchase them for the ploughing and cultivation of their fields and
gardens.They have therefore been stowed away in the storehouses.As
may be seen from the questions submitted by me to the Council of
Colombo on January 22, 1695, I proposed that the inhabitants should
be permitted to obtain these tools direct from Coromandel, which was
kindly granted by the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by
letter of December 12 of the same year.This may be considered the
fourth point in which they have been indulged; another is the license
given to them in the same letter from Batavia (confirmed in a letter
of July 3, 1696) that they may convey the products of their lands and
other small merchandise by vessel to Coromandel, north of Negapatam,
without being obliged to stop and pay Customs duty in the former place,
as they had to do since 1687.They must not therefore be restricted in
this, as I introduced this new rule as soon as the license arrived.[21]

The palmyra timber required by the Company for Colombo and Jaffnapatam
used to be exacted from the inhabitants at a very low price which
had been fixed for them.They had not only to deliver this, but also
that which some of the Company's servants demanded for their private
use at the same low rate, under pretence that it was required for the
Company; so that the owners not only lost their trees and what they
might obtain from them for their maintenance, but were also obliged
to transport this timber and the laths, after they had been split,
from their gardens for two or three miles to the harbours from which
they were to be shipped, either to the seacoast or to the banks of
the river.Besides this they had still to pay the tax fixed for those
trees in the Thombo.Moreover, it happened that in the year 1677
there was such a large demand for these planks and laths, not only
in Colombo but also in Negapatam, that no less than 50,687 different
staves and 26,040 laths were sent to the latter town on account of
the Company.Their Excellencies at Batavia, considering that such
a practice was too tyrannical and not in keeping with the mild,
reasonable, and just government which the Company wishes to carry on,
have lessened the burden of the inhabitants in this respect, and have
desired that in future no such demand should be made from them, but
that they should be allowed to sell this timber in the market.Further
particulars with regard to this matter may be found by Your Honours
in the letter from Their Excellencies to Ceylon of May 13, 1692, and
in the letter from His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo of April 29, 1695, which may serve for your guidance.This
may be considered as the fifth favour bestowed on the inhabitants,
but it does not extend to the palmyra planks and laths required by
the Company for the ordinary works in this Commandement or for the
Castle.These are to be paid for at the rate stated in the Trade
Account as paid formerly, because this is a duty they have been
subject to from olden times, and it is unadvisable to depart from
such customs without good reason, the nature of these people being
such that they would not consider it a favour and be grateful for it,
but if they were relieved of this they would continue to complain
of other matters.On the other hand they will, without complaint,
pay such duties as have been long customary, because they consider
themselves born to these.I therefore think it will be best to observe
the old customs.With regard to the purchase of planks and laths on
account of the Company, I found on my arrival from Batavia in this
Commandement that this had been done with the greatest carelessness,
the accounts being in a terrible disorder.I therefore proposed in
my letter of December 9, 1694, to Colombo that such purchases should
be made by the Dessave, as he, by virtue of his office, has the best
opportunity.This was approved of in the letter of the 22nd of the
same month, and since then a certain amount of cash, about Rds.100
or 200, has been handed to him for this purpose, and he accounts for
this money in the Trade Accounts and states how many planks and laths
have been delivered to the Company.In this way it may be always seen
how the account stands, and this practice must be continued.It must
also be seen that as many planks and laths are stored up at the outer
harbours for Coromandel and Trincomalee and at the inner harbours for
Colombo and our own use as will be possible without interfering with
the liberty granted to the inhabitants; because the demand both in
Negapatam and in Colombo is still very great, as may be seen in the
letter of February 10, 1695, to which I have referred.[22]

The felling of timber is a work that must receive particular attention,
as this is required for the repair of the Company's vessels, at
least such parts of them as stand above the water level.For repairs
under water no timber has so far been obtained in the Wanni that is
serviceable, as the timber there is liable to be attacked by a kind of
worm under water.Timber can be transported to the Castle only once
a year during the rainy season, when the rivers swell so much that
the timber which has been felled during the dry season can be brought
down to the Passes and from there to the Fort.Sometimes also timber
is felled near the seashore, when it is brought down along the coast
to Kayts or Hammenhiel by pressed Carrias or fishermen.Occasionally
some timber is also felled near the seacoast between Manaar and
Jaffnapatam, which is suitable for door posts, window frames, and
stocks for muskets and guns, while here also is found the timber for
gun-carriages, which comes in very useful, as the Fort must be well
provided with ammunition.Laurens Pyl for
this Commandement, bearing date November 7, 1679, [36] it is stated
in detail how the felling of timber is conducted and what class of
people are employed in this work.This subject is also dealt with
in the report by the late Mr.Blom of August 20, 1692, so that I
merely refer to these documents, and recommend that another and an
experienced person ought to be trained for the supervision of this work
in addition to the sergeant Harmen Claasz, who has done this work for
the last 25 years, and has gained much experience during his residence
in the forests of the Wanni, and knows exactly when the timber ought
to be felled, when it can be transported, and what kinds of trees are
the most suitable.Because it must be remembered that like all human
beings he also is only mortal.I therefore some time ago appointed the
soldier Laurens Hendriksz as his assistant.He is still employed in
the same capacity.As these forests are very malarious, there are but
few Dutchmen who could live there, and this is the more reason why Your
Honours should always see that an able person is trained to the work,
so as to avoid inconvenience some time or other.It is impossible to
employ a native in this work, because the Wannias would not have the
same regard for a native as for a European, and one of their caprices
to which they are so often subject might interfere with the work.[23]

Charcoal, made from the kernel of the palmyra fruit, is used here
for the smith's forge.In the Memoir referred to Your Honours will
also find stated by whom this is furnished to the Company.As I
noticed that the work in the smith's forge had to be discontinued
sometimes for want of charcoal, especially during the months of
August, September, and October, which causes great inconvenience to
the Government, I proposed to His Excellency the Governor and Council
that a quantity of smiths' coals from Holland should be provided.It must be used in times of scarcity, and the
people who are bound to collect and burn the kernel must be kept
to their duty, and compelled to deliver up the full extent of their
tax.The coals from Holland must be looked upon as a reserve supply,
to be used only when no pannangay kernels are to be had, as happens
sometimes when the inhabitants plant these seeds in order to obtain
from them a kind of root, called calengen, which they use as food.[24]

Bark-lunt is another article which the Company receives from the
inhabitants here without any expense.All inhabitants who go yearly
to the Wanni to sow and mow, consisting of about 6,000 or 7,000
and sometimes even 10,000 persons, and who pay 10 of these lunts to
the Wannias, have on their return at the Passes to pay a piece of
lunt each, 4 fathoms long, and for each cow or bull they have with
them and have employed in the Wanni for ploughing or have allowed
to graze there they also have to pay the same.This amounts to a
considerable quantity yearly, nearly 60,000 lunts.It is a matter
of little importance, but a great convenience, because not only the
garrison in this Commandement is thus furnished, but a large quantity
may also be sent to other places when required, as is done usually to
Negapatam and Trincomalee, for which a charge of 1 stiver a piece is
made, which amount is entered here with the general income and charged
to the said stations.Care must be taken that this duty is paid at
the Redoubts, but on the other hand also that not too much is charged
to these people, because I have heard complaints that sometimes more
than 4 fathoms of the lunt is demanded.This is unfair, because the
surplus is appropriated by persons who have no right to it.[25]

Coral stone, used for building purposes and for the burning of lime,
is found here in abundance.This also the Company obtains without any
expenditure, because it is dug up and broken by ordinary Oeliares.It
is also found at Point Pedro, where it is burnt into lime or otherwise
sent to the Castle in tonys or pontoons, where it is then either burnt
into lime, used for foundations or for the filling up of the body of
walls, which are then covered on the outside with cut coral stone,
as this makes them strong and durable.For some years the cut stone
has also been sent to Negapatam for the fortifications.This must be
continued until we receive notice that it is no longer necessary,
which I think will be soon, because I noticed that lately not so
much stone was asked for.From 1687 up to the present about 52,950
cut stones have been sent to this place.[26]

It may be understood from the above that lime is easily obtained here,
and without great expenditure.That which is required for the Company
here is delivered free of charge.For the lime sent to Negapatam 7
fanams are paid in place of 5 light stivers.[37] This is paid to the
lime burners at Canganture, who received an advance on this account,
of which a small balance is left.Meanwhile the Dessave de Bitter
informed us on his return from Coromandel that no more lime was
required there, but in order that the Company may not lose by the
advance made, a quantity of 8,000 or 9,000 parras of lime is lying
ready at Canganture, which must be fetched by the Company's vessels
in March or April and brought to Kayts.This, I think, will make up
the amount, and if not, they must reimburse the difference.It will
be seen from this that we have tried to comply with the wishes of
His late Excellency van Mydregt, who wrote from Negapatam on July 10,
1687, that the new fortifications there were to be supplied with lime
and all other building materials which are to be found here.The lime
sent there since that date has amounted to 4,751 31/75 lasts.[27]

The dye-root is a product found in this territory which yields the
Company a considerable profit.The best kinds are found in Carrediva,
but the largest quantity in Manaar.The other kinds, found in the
Wanni and The Islands, are so inferior that they cannot be used for
dyeing unless they are mixed with the kinds obtained from Manaar
and Carrediva, and are found in small quantities only.The inferior
kinds are used in this way so that they may not be lost, because it
is to be feared that there will be a greater scarcity of root than
of cloth.I will not enter into detail here as to how, by whom,
where, and when these roots are dug out, or how they are employed
in the dyeing of cloth, or again how much is received yearly; as
all these matters have been mentioned at length on other occasions,
making it unnecessary to do so here.I therefore refer Your Honours
to an account by the late Commandeur Blom, dated April 25, 1693,
with regard to the cultivation and digging of this root, and another
by the same Commandeur of November 12 of the same year with regard to
the dyeing of red cloth and the use of dye-root, while Your Honours
might also look up the document sent to Colombo on December 29, 1694,
by Your Honours and myself, and another of September 16, 1695, where
an estimate is made of the quantity of cloth that could be dyed here
yearly with the root found in this Commandement.An answer will also
be found there to the question raised by the Honourable the Supreme
Government of India in their letter to Ceylon of December 12, 1695,
as to whether the dye-roots found in Java costing Rds.5 the picol
[38] of 125 lb.and sent here might be employed with profit in the
service of the Company, and whether these roots from Java could not
with advantage be planted here.The reply from Colombo of January
6, 1696, in answer to our letter of September 16, 1695, must also
be considered, in order that Your Honours may bear in mind all the
arguments that have been urged on this subject.Experiments have been
made with the Java roots to see whether they could be turned to any
account, and with a view to compare them with the Jaffna roots.It
seems to me that good results may be obtained from the Brancoedoe
roots, according to the experiments made by myself and afterwards by a
Committee in compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies, but as
we cannot be quite sure yet another quantity of Java roots for further
experiments has been sent, as stated in the letter from Batavia of July
3, 1696.Your Honours must pay great attention to these experiments,
so that the result may be definitely known.This was prevented so
far by the rainy season.Besides the above-mentioned documents,
Your Honours will also find useful information on the subject in two
reports submitted by a Committee bearing date July 29 and December
10, 1695.Experiments must also be made to find out whether the
Wancoedoe roots used either alone or mixed with the Jaffna roots will
yield a good red dye of fast colour, this being the wish of Their
Excellencies.Meantime the red cloth ordered in 1694, being 142 webs,
and the 60 webs ordered lately, must be sent as soon as the required
linen arrives from Coromandel.This cloth must be carefully dyed, and
after being examined and approved by the members of Council must be
properly packed by the Pennisten of the Comptoiren who are employed
in this work, on both which points complaints have been received,
and which must be guarded against in future.During my residence
96 webs of cloth have been sent out of the 142 that were ordered,
so that 46 are yet to be sent, besides the 60 of the new order.No
more cloth and dye-roots must be issued to the dyers at a time than
they can use in one dyeing, because otherwise the cloth lies about in
their poor dwellings and gets damaged, while the roots are stolen or
used for private purposes, which is a loss to the Company, of which
many instances might be quoted.There is no doubt the Administrateur
Abraham Mighielsz Biermans, who has been entrusted with the supervision
of this work for many years, will endeavour to further the interests
of the Company in this respect as much as possible and keep these lazy
people to their work.For the present there is a sufficient quantity
of material in stock, as there were in the storehouses on the last
of November, 1696, 60,106 lb.of different kinds of dye-root, with
which a large quantity of cloth may be dyed, while a yearly supply is
delivered at the Fort from Manaar, Carrediva, &c. In Carrediva and "the
Seven Places" as they are called, much less is delivered than formerly,
because at present roots are dug up after the fields have been sown,
while formerly this used to be done before the lands were cultivated,
to the disadvantage of the owners.This practice was abandoned during
the time of Commandeur Blom, as it was considered unfair; because the
fields are already heavily taxed, and on this account the delivery
is 20 to 25 bharen [39] less than before.[28]

The farming out of the various duties in this Commandement may
be considered as the third source of revenue to the Company in
Jaffnapatam, and next to that of the sale of elephants and the revenue
derived from the poll tax, land rents, tithes, Adigary, and Officie
Gelden mentioned before.The farming out of the said duties on the last
of February, 1696, brought to the Company the sum of Rds.27,518 for
the period of one and a half year.The leases were extended on this
occasion with a view to bring them to a close with the close of the
Trade Accounts, which, in compliance with the latest instructions from
Batavia, must be balanced on August 31.The previous year, from March
1 to February 28, 1695-1696, the lease of the said duties amounted
to Rds.15,641, which for 18 months would have been Rds.23,461 1/2,
so that the Company received this year Rds.4,056 1/2 more than last
time; but I believe that the new duty on the import of foreign cloth
has largely contributed to this difference.This was proposed by me
on January 22, 1695, and approved by the Hon.the Supreme Government
of India in their letter of December 12 of the same year.7,100, including the stamping of native cloth with
a seal at 25 per cent., while for the foreign cloth no more than 20
per cent.As Their Excellencies considered this difference
unfair, it has pleased them, at the earnest request of the natives,
or rather at the request of the Majoraals on behalf of the natives, in
a later letter of July 3, 1696, to consent to the native cloth being
taxed at 20 per cent.only, which must be considered in connection
with the new lease.Meantime the order from Batavia contained in
the Resolutions of the Council of India of October 4, 1694, must be
observed, where all farmers are required to pay the monthly terms
of their lease at the beginning of each month in advance.This rule
has been followed here, and it is expressly stipulated in the rent
conditions.Whether the farming out of the duty on native and foreign
cloth will amount to as much or more I cannot say; because I fear
that the present farmer has not made much profit by it, in consequence
of the export having decreased on account of the closing of the free
passage to Trincomalee and Batticaloa.The sale of these cloths depends
largely on the import of nely from the said places, and this having
been prevented the sale necessarily decreased and consequently the
farmer made less profit.The passage having been re-opened, however,
it may be expected that the sale will increase again.With a view
to ascertain the exact value of this lease, I sent orders to all
the Passes on February 27, 1696, that a monthly list should be kept
of how many stamped cloths are passed through and by whom, so that
Your Honours will be able to see next August how much cloth has been
exported by examining these lists, while you may also make an estimate
of the quantity of cloth sold here without crossing the Passes, as
the farmer obtains his duty on these.Your Honours may further read
what was reported on this subject from here to Colombo on December 16,
1696, and the reply from Colombo of January 6 of this year.[29]

The Trade Accounts are closed now on August 31, as ordered by the
Supreme Government of India in their letter of May 3, 1695.Last
year's account shows that in this Commandement the Company made a
clear profit of Fl.It might have been greater if more
elephants could have been obtained from the Wanni and Ponneryn, or if
we were allowed the profits on the elephants from Galle and Colombo
sold here on behalf of the Company, which are not accompanied by an
invoice, but only by a simple acknowledgment.Another reason that it
was not higher is that we had to purchase the very expensive grain
from Coromandel.Your Honours must also see that besides observing
this rule of closing the accounts in August, they are submitted to
the Council for examination, in order that it may be seen whether the
discharges are lawful and whether other matters are in agreement with
the instructions, and also whether some items could not be reduced
in future, in compliance with the order passed by Resolution in the
Council of India on September 6, 1694.These and all other orders
sent here during the last two years must be strictly observed, such
as the sending to Batavia of the old muskets, the river navigation
of ships and sloops, the reduction of native weights and measures to
Dutch pounds, the carrying over of the old credits and debits into
the new accounts, the making and use of casks of a given measure,
and the accounting for the new casks of meat, bacon, butter, and
all such orders, which cannot be all mentioned here, but which Your
Honours must look up now and again so as not to forget any and thus
be involved in difficulties.[(30)]

The debts due to the Company at the closing of the accounts must be
entered in a separate memorandum, and submitted with the accounts.In
this memorandum the amount of the debt must be stated, with the name
of the debtor, and whether there is a prospect of the amount being
recovered or not.As shown by Their Excellencies, these outstandings
amounted at the closing of the accounts at the end of February, 1694,
to the sum of Fl.This was reduced on my last departure
to Colombo to Fl.31,948.9.15, as may be seen in the memorandum by the
Administrateur of January 31, 1696.I will now proceed to show that on
my present departure no more is due than the amount of Fl.16,137.8,
in which, however, the rent of the farmers is not included, as it is
only provisional and will be paid up each month, viz.:--


                                                    Fl.The Province of Timmoraten                 376.2.8 [40]
        The Province of Pathelepally               579.10.0
        Panduamoety and Nagachitty               2,448.13.0
        Company's weavers                          167.15.0
        Manuel van Anecotta, Master Dyer         9,823.6.0
        The Caste of the Tannecares              1,650.0.0
        The dyers at Point Pedro and Nalloer       566.14.0
        Don Philip Nellamapane                     375.0.0
        Ambelawanner Wannia                        150.0.0
                                                ===========
                                      Total     16,137.0.8


With regard to the debt of the weavers, amounting to Fl.2,616.8,
I deem it necessary here to mention that the arrears in Timmoratsche
and Patchelepally, spoken of in the memorandum by the Administrateur
of January 31, 1696, compiled by Mr.Bierman on my orders of November
30, 1695, after the closing of the accounts at the end of August,
of which those of Tandia Moety and Naga Chitty and that of the
Company's weavers which refer to the same persons, may, in my opinion,
be considered as irrecoverable.It would therefore be best if Their
Excellencies at Batavia would exempt them from the payment.This debt
dates from the time when it was the intention to induce some weavers
from the opposite coast to come here for the weaving of cloth for the
Company.This caste, called Sinias, [41] received the said amount in
cash, thread, and cotton in advance, and thus were involved in this
large debt, which having been reduced to the amount stated above, has
remained for some years exactly the same, in spite of all endeavours
made to collect it, and notwithstanding that the Paybook-keeper was
appointed to see that the materials were not stolen and the money not
wasted.It has been, however, all in vain, because these people were
so poor that they could not help stealing if they were to live, and it
seems impossible to recover the amount, which was due at first from
200 men, out of whom only 15 or 16 are left now.When they do happen
occasionally to deliver a few gingams, these are so inferior that
the soldiers who receive them at the price of good materials complain
a great deal.I think it unfair that the military should be made to
pay in this way, as the gingams are charged by the Sinias at Fl.6
or 6.10 a piece, while the soldiers have to accept the same at Fl.The same is the case with the Moeris and other cloths which
are delivered by the Sinias, or rather which are obtained from them
with much difficulty; and I have no doubt Your Honours will receive
instructions from Batavia with regard to this matter.Meanwhile they
must be dealt with in the ordinary way; but in case they are exempted
from the payment of their debt I think they ought to be sent out of
the country, not only because they are not liable to taxes or services
to the Company, but also because of the idolatry and devil-worship
which they have to a certain extent been allowed to practise, and
which acts as a poison to the other inhabitants, among whom we have
so long tried to introduce the Dutch Reformed religion.The debt of the dyers at Annecatte, entered under the name of Manoel of
Annecatte, dyer, which amounted at the end of August to Fl.9,823.6,
has been since reduced by Fl.707.10, and is still being reduced
daily, as there is sufficient work at present to keep them all busy,
of which mention has been made under the heading of Dye-roots.This
debt amounted at the end of February, 1694, to Fl.11,920.13.6, so
that since that time one-third has been recovered.This is done by
retaining half the pay for dyeing; for when they deliver red cloth
they only receive half of their pay, and there is thus a prospect
of the whole of this debt being recovered.Care must be taken that
no one gives them any money on interest, which has been prohibited,
because it was found that selfish people, aware of the poverty of
these dyers, sometimes gave them money, not only on interest but at
a usurious rate, so that they lost also half of the pay they received
from the Company on account of those debts, and were kept in continual
poverty, which made them either despondent or too lazy to work.For
this reason an order was issued during the time of the late Commandeur
Blom that such usurers would lose all they had lent to these dyers,
as the Company would not interfere on behalf of the creditors as long
as the debt to the Company was still due.On this account also their
lands have been mortgaged to the Company, and Mr.Blom proposed in
his questions of December 22, 1693, that these should be sold.But
this will not be necessary now, and it would not be advantageous to
the Company if the weavers were thus ruined, while on the other hand
this debt may on the whole be recovered.(31)

The Tannekares are people who made a contract with the Company during
the time of Mr.Blom by a deed bearing date June 7, 1691, in terms
of which they were to deliver two elephants without teeth in lieu
of their poll tax amounting to Fl.269.4.17/60 and for their Oely
service.It was found, however, last August that they were in arrears
for 11 animals, which, calculated at Rds.150 each, brings
their debts to Fl.As all contracts of this
kind for the delivery of elephants are prejudicial to the Company,
I proposed on January 22, 1695, that this contract should be annulled,
stating our reasons for doing so.This proposal was submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia in our letter of August 12 of the same year,
and was approved by them by their letter of December 12, 1695, so that
these people are again in the same position as the other inhabitants,
and will be taxed by the Thombo-keeper for poll tax, land rent, and
Oely service from September 1, 1696.These they must be made to pay,
and they also must be made to pay up the arrears, which they are quite
capable of doing, which matter must be recommended to the attention
of the tax collector in Waddamoraatsche.The debt due by the dyers of Nalloer and Point Pedro, which arose
from their receiving half their pay in advance at their request,
as they were not able to pay their poll tax and land rent (which
amounted to Fl.566.14), has been paid up since.The debt of Don Philip Nellamapane, which amounts to Fl.375, arose
from the amount being lent to him for the purchase of nely in the
latter part of 1694, because there was a complaint that the Wannias,
through a failure of the crop, did not have a sufficient quantity
of grain for the maintenance of the hunters.This money was handed
to Don Gaspar Ilengenarene Mudaliyar, brother-in-law of Don Philip,
and at the request of the latter; so that really, not he, but Don
Gaspar, owes the money.He must be urged to pay up this amount,
which it would be less difficult to do if they were not so much in
arrears with their tribute, because in that case the first animals
they delivered could be taken in payment.There is no doubt, however,
that this debt will be paid if they are urged.The same is the case with the sum of Fl.150 which Ambelewanne Wannia
owes, but as he has to deliver only a few elephants this small amount
can be settled the first time he delivers any elephants above his
tribute.(32)

The Pay Accounts must, like the Trade Accounts, be closed on the
last day of August every year, in compliance with the orders of the
Honourable the Supreme Government of India contained in their letter
of August 13, 1695.They must also be audited and examined, according
to the Resolution passed in the Council of India on September 6,
1694, so that it may be seen whether all the items entered in the
Trade Accounts for payments appear also in the Pay Accounts, while
care must be taken that those who are in arrears at the close of the
books on account of advance received do not receive such payments too
liberally, against which Your Honours will have to guard, so that no
difficulties may arise and the displeasure of Their Excellencies may
not be incurred.Care must also be taken that the various instructions
for the Paybook-keeper are observed, such as those passed by Resolution
of Their Excellencies on August 27 and June 29, 1694, with regard to
the appraising, selling, and entering in the accounts of estates left
by the Company's servants, the rules for the Curators ad lites, those
with regard to the seizure of salaries by private debtors passed by
Resolution of August 5, 1696, in the Council of India, and the rules
passed by Resolution of March 20, with regard to such sums belonging
to the Company's servants as may be found outstanding on interest
after their death, namely, that these must four or six weeks after
be transferred from the Trade Accounts into the Pay Accounts to the
credit of the deceased.(33)

The matter of the Secretariate not being conducted as it ought to
be, cannot be dealt with in full here.It was said in the letters
of November 17 and December 12, 1696, that the new Secretary,
Mr.Bout (who was sent here without any previous intimation to the
Commandeur), would see that all documents were properly registered,
bound, and preserved, but these are the least important duties
of a good Secretary.I cannot omit to recommend here especially
that a journal should be kept, in which all details are entered,
because there are many occurrences with regard to the inhabitants,
the country, the trade, elephants, &c., which it will be impossible to
find when necessary unless they appear in the letters sent to Colombo,
which, however, do not always deal very circumstancially with these
matters.It will be best therefore to keep an accurate journal,
which I found has been neglected for the last three years, surely
much against the intention of the Company.The Secretary must also
see that the Scholarchial resolutions and the notes made on them by
the Political Council are copied and preserved at the Secretariate,
another duty which has not been done for some years.I know on the
other hand that a great deal of the time of the Secretary is taken up
with the keeping of the Treasury Accounts, while there is no Chief
Clerk here to assist him with the Treasury Accounts, or to assist
the Commandeur.Blom, and he proposed
in his letters of February 12 and March 29, 1693, to Colombo that
the Treasury Accounts should be kept by the Paybook-keeper, which,
in my humble opinion, would be the best course, as none of the four
Onderkooplieden [42] here could be better employed for this work
than the Paybook-keeper.It must be remembered, however, that Their
Excellencies do not wish the Regulation of December 29, 1692, to be
altered or transgressed, so that these must be still observed.I would
propose a means by which the duties of the Cashier, and consequently of
the Secretary, could be much decreased, considering that the Cashier
can get no other knowledge of the condition of the general revenue
than from the Thombo-keeper who makes up the accounts, namely, that
the Thombo-keeper should act as General Accountant, as well of the
rent for leases as of the poll tax, land rent, tithes, &c., in which
case the native collectors could give their accounts to him.This,
I expect, would simplify matters, and enable the Secretary to be of
more assistance to the Commandeur.In case such arrangement should be
made, the General Accountant could keep the accounts of the revenue
specified above, which could afterwards be transferred to the accounts
of the Treasury; but Your Honours must wait for the authority to do
so, as I do not wish to take this responsibility.I must recommend
to Your Honours here to see that in future no petitions with regard
to fines are written for the inhabitants except by the Secretaries
of the Political Council or the Court of Justice, as those officers
in India act as Notaries.This has to be done because the petitions
from these rebellious people of Jaffnapatam are so numerous that the
late Mr.Blom had to forbid some of them writing such communications,
because even Toepasses and Mestices take upon themselves to indite
such letters, which pass under the name of petitions, but are often so
full of impertinent and seditious expressions that they more resemble
libels than petitions.Since neither superior nor inferior persons
are spared in these documents, it is often impossible to discover the
author.Whenever the inhabitants have any complaint to make, I think
it will be sufficient if they ask either of the two Secretaries to
draw out a petition for them in which their grievances are stated,
which may be sent to Colombo if the case cannot be decided here.In
this way it will be possible to see that the petitions are written
on stamped paper as ordered by the Company, while they will be
written with the moderation and discrimination that is necessary in
petitions.There are also brought to the Secretariate every year all
sorts of native protocols, such as those kept by the schoolmasters
at the respective churches, deeds, contracts, ola deeds of sale,
and other instruments as may have been circulated among the natives,
which it is not possible to attend to at the Dutch Secretariate.But
as I have been informed that the schoolmasters do not always observe
the Company's orders, and often issue fraudulent instruments and thus
deceive their own countrymen, combining with the Majoraals and the
Chiefs of the Aldeas, by whom a great deal of fraud is committed,
it will be necessary for the Dessave to hold an inquiry and punish
the offenders or deliver them up for punishment.For this purpose
he must read and summarize the instructions with regard to this and
other matters issued successively by Their Excellencies the Governors
of Ceylon and the subaltern Commandeurs of this Commandement, to be
found in the placaats and notices published here relating to this
Commandement.The most important of these rules must be published in
the different churches from time to time, as the people of Jaffnapatam
are much inclined to all kinds of evil practices, which has been
the reason that so many orders and regulations had to be issued by
the placaats, all which laws are the consequence of transgressions
committed.Yet it is very difficult to make these people observe
the rules so long as they find but the least encouragement given to
them by the higher authorities, as stated already.It was decided in
the Meeting of Council of October 20, 1696, that a large number of
old and useless olas which were kept at the Secretariate and were
a great encumbrance should be sorted, and the useless olas burnt
in the presence of a committee, while the Mallabaar and Portuguese
documents concerning the Thombo or description of lands were to be
placed in the custody of the Thombo-keeper.This may be seen in the
report of November 8 of the same year.In this way the Secretariate
has been cleared, and the documents concerning the Thombo put in their
proper place, where they must be kept in future; so that the different
departments may be kept separately with a view to avoid confusion.I
have also noticed on various occasions that the passports of vessels
are lost, either at the Secretariate or elsewhere.Therefore, even so
lately as last December, instructions were sent to Kayts and Point
Pedro to send all such passports here as soon as possible.These
passports, on the departure of the owners, were to be kept at the
Secretariate after renovation by endorsement, unless they were more
than six months old, in which case a new passport was to be issued.In
case Your Honours are not sufficiently acquainted with the form of
these passports and how they are to be signed as introduced by His
late Excellency Governor van Mydregt, you will find the necessary
information in the letters from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of 1687 and
1688 and another from Colombo to Jaffnapatam bearing date April 11,
1690, in which it is stated to what class of persons passports may
be issued.The same rules must be observed in Manaar so far as this
district is concerned, in compliance with the orders contained in
the letter of November 13, 1696.(34)

The Court of Justice has of late lost much of its prestige among the
inhabitants, because, seeing that the Bellale Mudaly Tamby, to whom
previous reference has been made, succeeded on a simple petition sent
to Colombo to escape the Court of Justice while his case was still
undecided (as may be seen from a letter from Colombo of January 6,
1696, and the reply thereto of the 26th of this month), they have an
idea that they cannot be punished here.Even people of the lowest caste
threaten that they will follow the same course whenever they think
they will not gain their object here, especially since they have seen
with what honours Mudaly Tamby was sent back and how the Commissioners
did all he desired, although his own affairs were not even sufficiently
settled yet.A great deal may be stated and proved on this subject, but
as this is not the place to do so, I will only recommend Your Honours
to uphold the Court of Justice in its dignity as much as possible,
and according to the rules and regulations laid down with regard to
it in the Statutes of Batavia and other Instructions.The principal
rule must be that every person receives speedy and prompt justice,
which for various reasons could not be done in the case of Mudaly
Tamby, and the opportunity was given for his being summoned to Colombo.At present the Court of Justice consists of the following persons:--


The Commandeur, President (absent).Dessave de Bitter, Vice-President.van der Bruggen, Administrateur.The Thombo-keeper, Pieter Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos.The Onderkoopman Jan van Groeneveld.But it must be considered that on my departure to Mallabaar, and in
case the Dessave be commissioned to the pearl fishery, this College
will be without a President; the Onderkooplieden Bolscho and Roos
may also be away in the interior for the renovation of the Head
Thombo, and it may also happen that Lieut.Claas Isaacsz will be
appointed Lieutenant-Dessave, in which case he also would have to go
to the interior; in such case there would be only three members left
besides the complainant ex-officio and the Secretary, who would have
no power to pronounce sentence.The Lieutenant van Hovingen and the
Secretary of the Political Council could be appointed for the time,
but in that case the Court would be more a Court Martial than a Court
of Justice, consisting of three Military men and two Civil Servants,
while there would be neither a President nor a Vice-President.I
consider it best, therefore, that the sittings of the Court should
be suspended until the return of the Dessave from the pearl fishery,
unless His Excellency the Governor and the Council should give other
instructions, which Your Honours would be bound to obey.I also found that no law books are kept at the Court, and it would
be well, therefore, if Your Honours applied to His Excellency the
Governor and the Council to provide you with such books as they deem
most useful, because only a minority of the members possess these
books privately, and, as a rule, the Company's servants are poor
lawyers.Justice may therefore be either too severely or too leniently
administered.There are also many native customs according to which
civil matters have to be settled, as the inhabitants would consider
themselves wronged if the European laws be applied to them, and it
would be the cause of disturbances in the country.As, however, a
knowledge of these matters cannot be obtained without careful study and
experience, which not every one will take the trouble to acquire, it
would be well if a concise digest be compiled according to information
supplied by the chiefs and most impartial natives.No one could have a
better opportunity to do this than the Dessave, and such a work might
serve for the instruction of the members of the Court of Justice as
well as for new rulers arriving here, for no one is born with this
knowledge.I am surprised that no one has as yet undertaken this work.Laurens Pyl in his Memoir of November 7, 1679,
with regard to the Court of Justice, namely, that the greatest
precautions must be used in dealing with this false, cunning, and
deceitful race, who think little of taking a false oath when they see
any advantage for themselves in doing so, must be followed.This is
perhaps the reason that the Mudaliyars Don Philip Willewaderayen and
Don Anthony Naryna were ordered in a letter from Colombo of March 22,
1696, to take their oath at the request of the said Mudaly Tamby
only in the heathen fashion, although this seemed out of keeping
with the principles of the Christian religion (Salva Reverentio),
as these people are recognized as baptized Christians, and therefore
the taking of this oath is not practised here.The natives are also
known to be very malicious and contentious among themselves, and do
not hesitate to bring false charges against each other, sometimes for
the sole purpose of being able to say that they gained a triumph over
their opponents before the Court of Justice.They are so obstinate
in their pretended rights that they will revive cases which had been
decided during the time of the Portuguese, and insist on these being
dealt with again.I have been informed that some rules have been laid
down with regard to such cases by other Commandeurs some 6, 8, 10,
and 20 years previous, which it would be well to look up with a view
to restrain these people.They also always revive cases decided by
the Commandeurs or Dessaves whenever these are succeeded by others,
and for this reason I never consented to alter any decision by a former
Commandeur, as the party not satisfied can always appeal to the higher
court at Colombo.His Excellency the Governor and the Council desired
very properly in their letter of November 15, 1694, that no processes
decided civilly by a Commandeur as regent should be brought in appeal
before the Court of Justice here, because the same Commandeur acts in
that College as President.Such cases must therefore be referred to
Colombo, which is the proper course.Care must also be taken that all
documents concerning each case are preserved, registered, and submitted
by the Secretary.I say this because I found that this was shamefully
neglected during my residence here in the years 1691 and 1692, when
several cases had been decided and sentences pronounced, of which not
a single document was preserved, still less the notes or copies made.Another matter to be observed is that contained in the Resolutions
of the Council of India of June 14, 1694, where the amounts paid to
the soldiers and sailors are ordered not to exceed the balance due
to them above what is paid for them monthly in the Fatherland.I
also noticed that at present 6 Lascoreens and 7 Caffirs are paid
as being employed by the Fiscaal, while formerly during the time
of the late Fiscaal Joan de Ridder, who was of the rank of Koopman,
not more than 5 Lascoreens and 6 Caffirs were ever paid for.I do not
know why the number has been increased, and this greater expense is
imposed upon the Company.No more than the former number are to be
employed in future.This number has sufficed for so many years under
the former Fiscaal, and as the Fiscaal has no authority to arrest any
natives without the knowledge of the Commandeur or the Dessave, it
will still suffice.It was during the time of the late Onderkoopman
Lengele, when the word "independent" carried much weight, that the
staff of native servants was increased, although for the service of
the whole College of the Political Council not more than 4 Lascoreens
are employed, although its duties are far more numerous than those of
the Fiscaal.I consider that the number of native servants should be
limited to that strictly necessary, so that it may not be said that
they are kept for show or for private purposes.[35]

The Company has endeavoured at great expense, from the time it took
possession of this Island, to introduce the religion of the True
Reformed Christian Church among this perverse nation.For this purpose
there have been maintained during the last 38 years 35 churches and
3 or 4 clergymen, but how far this has been accepted by the people
of Jaffnapatam I will leave for my successors to judge, rather than
express my opinion on the subject here.It is a well-known fact that
in the year 1693 nearly all the churches in this part of the country
were found stocked with heathen books, besides the catechisms and
Christian prayer books.It is remarkable that this should have
occurred after His late Excellency Governor van Mydregt in 1689
had caused all Roman Catholic churches and secret convents to be
dismantled and abolished, and instead of them founded a Seminary or
Training School for the propagation of the true religion, incurring
great expenses for this purpose.I heard only lately that, while I
was in Colombo and the Dessave in Negapatam, a certain Lascoreen,
with the knowledge of the schoolmasters of the church in Warrany, had
been teaching the children the most wicked fables one could think of,
and that these schoolmasters had been summoned before the Court of
Justice here and caned and the books burnt.But on my return I found
to my surprise that these schoolmasters had not been dismissed, and
that neither at the Political Council nor at the Court of Justice
had any notes been made of this occurrence, and still less a record
made as to how the case had been decided.The masters were therefore
on my orders summoned again before the meeting of the Scholarchen,
by which they were suspended until such time as the Lascoreen should
be arrested.I have not succeeded in laying hands on this Lascoreen,
but Your Honours must make every endeavour, after my departure, to
trace him out; because he may perhaps imagine that the matter has
been forgotten.Such occurrences as these are not new in Warrany;
because the idolatry committed there in 1679 will be known to some
of you.On that occasion the authors were arrested by the Company
through the assistance of the Brahmin Timmersa Nayk, notwithstanding he
himself was a heathen, as may be seen from the public acknowledgment
granted to him by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, November 7, 1679.I
therefore think that the Wannias are at the bottom of all this
idolatry, not only because they have alliances with the Bellales all
over the country, but especially because their adherents are to be
found in Warrany and also in the whole Province of Patchelepalle,
where half the inhabitants are dependent on them.This was seen at
the time the Wannias marched about here in Jaffnapatam in triumph,
and almost posed as rulers here.We may be assured that they are
the greatest devil-worshippers that could be found, for they have
never yet admitted a European into their houses, for fear of their
idolatry being discovered, while for the sake of appearance they
allow themselves to be married and baptized by our ministers.For instance, it is a well-known fact that Don Philip Nellamapane
applied to His late Excellency van Mydregt that one of his sons might
be admitted into the Seminary, with a view of getting into his good
graces; while no sooner had His Excellency left this than the son
was recalled under some false pretext.In 1696, when this boy was in
Negapatam with the Dessave de Bitter, he was caught making offerings
in the temples, wearing disguise at the time.It could not be expected
that such a boy, of no more than ten or twelve years old, should do
this if he had not been taught or ordered by his parents to do so
or had seen them doing the same, especially as he was being taught
another religion in the Seminary.I could relate many such instances,
but as this is not the place to do so, this may serve as an example
to put you on your guard.It is only known to God, who searches the
hearts and minds of men, what the reason is that our religion is not
more readily accepted by this nation: whether it is because the time
for their conversion has not yet arrived, or whether for any other
reason, I will leave to the Omniscient Lord.You might read what has
been written by His Excellency van Mydregt in his proposal to the
reverend brethren the clergy and the Consistory here on January 11,
1690, with regard to the promotion of religion and the building of
a Seminary.I could refer to many other documents bearing on this
subject, but I will only quote here the lessons contained in the
Instructions of the late Commandeur Paviljoen of December 19, 1665,
where he urges that the reverend brethren the clergy must be upheld and
supported by the Political Council in the performance of their august
duties, and that they must be provided with all necessary comforts;
so that they may not lose their zeal, but may carry out their work
with pleasure and diligence.On the other hand care must be taken
that no infringement of the jurisdiction of the Political Council
takes place, and on this subject it would be well for Your Honours
to read the last letter from Batavia of July 3,1696, with regard to
the words Sjuttan Peria Padrie and other such matters concerning the
Political Council as well as the clergy.(36)

With regard to the Seminary or training school for native children
founded in the year 1690 by His late Excellency van Mydregt, as another
evidence of the anxiety of the Company to propagate the True and Holy
Gospel among this blind nation for the salvation of their souls,
I will state here chiefly that Your Honours may follow the rules
and regulations compiled by His Excellency, as also those sent to
Jaffnapatam on the 16th of the same month.Twice a year the pupils
must be examined in the presence of the Scholarchen (those of the
Seminary as well as of the other churches) and of the clergy and the
rector.In this college the Commandeur is to act as President, but, as
I am to depart to Mallabaar, this office must be filled by the Dessave,
in compliance with the orders contained in the letters from Colombo
of April 4, 1696.The reports of these examinations must be entered
in the minute book kept by the Scriba, Jan de Crouse.These minutes
must be signed by the President and the other curators, while Your
Honours will be able to give further instructions and directions as
to how they are to be kept.During my absence the examination must be
held in the presence of the Dessave, and the Administrateur Michiels
Biermans and the Thombo-keeper Pieter Bolscho as Scholarchen of the
Seminary, the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and the Onderkoopman Joan Roos
as Scholarchen of the native churches, the reverend Adrianus Henricus
de Mey, acting Rector, and three other clergymen.It must be remembered, however, that this is only with regard to
examinations and not with regard to the framing of resolutions, which
so far has been left to the two Scholarchen and the President of the
Seminary.These, as special curators and directors, have received
higher authority from His Excellency the Governor and the Council,
with the understanding, however, that they observe the rules given
by His Excellency and the Council both with regard to the rector and
the children, in their letters of April 4 and June 13, 1696, and the
Resolutions framed by the curators of June 27 and October 21, 1695,
which were approved in Colombo.Whereas the school had been so far
maintained out of a fund set apart for this purpose, in compliance
with the orders of His Excellency, special accounts being kept of
the expenditure, it has now pleased the Council of India to decide
by Resolution of October 4, 1694, that only the cost of erection
of this magnificent building, which amounted to Rds.5,274, should
be paid out of the said fund.This debt having been paid, orders
were received in a letter from Their Excellencies of June 3, 1696,
that the institution is to be maintained out of the Company's funds,
special accounts of the expenditure being kept and sent yearly, both
to the Fatherland and to Batavia.At the closing of the accounts
last August the accounts of the Seminary as well as the amount due
to it were transferred to the Company's accounts.17,141, made up as follows:--


    Rds.10,341 entered at the Chief Counting-house in Colombo.1,200 cash paid by the Treasurer of the Seminary into the
                Company's Treasury, December 1, 1696.The latter was on December 1, 1690, on the foundation of the Seminary,
granted to that institution, and must now again, as before, be
placed by the Cashier on interest and a special account kept thereof;
because out of this fund the repairs to the churches and schools and
the expenses incurred in the visits of the clergy and the Scholarchen
have to be paid.Other items of revenue which had been appropriated
for the foundation of the Seminary, such as the farming out of
the fishery, &c., must be entered again in the Company's accounts,
as well as the revenue derived from the sale of lands, and that of
the two elephants allowed yearly to the Seminary.The fines levied
occasionally by the Dessave on the natives for offences committed
must be entered in the accounts of the Deaconate or of that of the
church fines, for whichever purpose they are most required.The Sicos [43] money must again be expended in the fortifications,
as it used to be done before the building of the Training School.The
income of the Seminary consisted of these six items, besides the
interest paid on the capital.This, I think, is all I need say on
the subject for Your Honours' information.I will only add that I
hope and pray that the Lord may more and more bless this Christian
design and the religious zeal of the Company.(37)

The Scholarchen Commission is a college of civil and ecclesiastical
officers, which for good reasons was introduced into this part of
the country from the very beginning of our rule.Their meetings are
usually held on the first Tuesday of every month, and at these is
decided what is necessary to be done for the advantage of the church,
such as the discharge and appointment of schoolmasters and merinhos,
[44] &c. It is here also that the periodical visits of the brethren of
the clergy to the different parishes are arranged.The applications of
natives who wish to enter into matrimony are also addressed to this
college.All the decisions are entered monthly in the resolutions,
which are submitted to the Political Council.This is done as I had
an idea that things were not as they ought to be with regard to the
visitation of churches and inspection of schools, and that the rules
made to that effect had come to be disregarded.This was a bad example,
and it may be seen from the Scholarchial Resolution Book of 1695 and
of the beginning of 1696, what difficulty I had in reintroducing these
rules.I succeeded at last so far in this matter that the visits of
the brethren of the clergy were properly divided and the time for them
appointed.This may be seen from the replies of the Political Council
to the Scholarchial Resolutions of January 14 and February 2, 1696.On my return from Ceylon I found inserted in the Scholarchial
Resolution Book a petition from two of the clergymen which had been
clandestinely sent to Colombo, in which they did not hesitate to
complain of the orders issued with regard to the visits referred to,
and, although these orders had been approved by His Excellency the
Governor and the Council, as stated above, the request made in this
clandestine petition was granted on March 6, 1696, and the petition
returned to Jaffnapatam with a letter signed on behalf of the Company
on March 14 following.It is true I also found an order from Colombo,
bearing date April 4 following, to the effect that no petitions should
be sent in future except through the Government here, which is in
accordance with the rules observed all over India, but the letter
from Colombo of November 17, received here, and the letter sent from
here to Colombo on December 12, prove that the rule was disregarded
almost as soon as it was made.On this account I could not reply
to the resolutions of the Scholarchen, as the petition, contrary to
those rules, was inserted among them.I think that the respect due
to a ruler in the service of the Company should not be sacrificed to
the private opposition of persons who consider that the orders issued
are to their disadvantage, and who rely on the success of private
petitions sent clandestinely which are publicly granted.In order not
to expose myself to such an indignity for the second time I left the
resolutions unanswered, and it will be necessary for Your Honours to
call a meeting of the Political Council to consider these resolutions,
to prevent the work among the natives being neglected.The College
of the Scholarchen consists at present of the following persons:--


The Dessave de Bitter, President.The Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, Scholarch.The Onderkoopman P. Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos, Scholarch.Adrianus Henricus de Mey, Clergyman.Philippus de Vriest, Clergyman.Thomas van Symey, Clergyman.I am obliged to mention here also for Your Honours' information that I
have noticed that the brethren of the clergy, after having succeeded
by means of their petition to get the visits arranged according to
their wish, usually apply for assistance, such as attendants, coolies,
cayoppen, &c., as soon as the time for their visits arrive, that is to
say, when it is their turn to go to such places as have the reputation
of furnishing good mutton, fowls, butter, &c.; but when they have to
visit the poorer districts, such as Patchelepalle, the boundaries of
the Wanny, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, they seldom give notice of the
arrival of the time, and some even go to the length of refusing to go
until they are commanded to depart.From this an idea may be formed of
the nature of their love for the work of propagating religion.Some
also take their wives with them on their visits of inspection to
the churches and schools, which is certainly not right as regards
the natives, because they have to bear the expense.With regard to
the regulations concerning the churches and schools, I think these
are so well known to Your Honours that it would be superfluous for
me to quote any documents here.I will therefore only recommend the
strict observation of all these rules, and also of those made by His
Excellency Mr.van Mydregt of November 29, 1690, and those of Mr.Blom
of October 20, with regard to the visits of the clergy to the churches
and the instructions for the Scholarchen in Ceylon generally by His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of December 25, 1663, and
approved by the Council of India with a few alterations in March, 1667.The Consistory consists at present of the four ministers mentioned
above, besides:--


Joan Roos, Elder.To these is added as Commissaris Politicus, the Administrateur Abraham
Michielsz Biermans, in compliance with the orders of December 27, 1643,
issued by His late Excellency the Governor General Antony van Diemen
and the Council of India at Batavia.Further information relating
to the churches may be found in the resolutions of the Political
Council and the College of the Scholarchen of Ceylon from March 13,
1668, to April 3 following.I think that in these documents will be
found all measures calculated to advance the prosperity of the church
in Jaffnapatam, and to these may be added the instructions for the
clergy passed at the meeting of January 11, 1651.(38)

The churches and the buildings attached to the churches are in many
places greatly decayed.I found to my regret that some churches
look more like stables than buildings where the Word of God is to be
propagated among the Mallabaars.It is evident that for some years
very little has been done in regard to this matter, and as this is a
work particularly within the province of the Dessave, I have no doubt
that he will take the necessary measures to remedy the evil; so that
the natives may not be led to think that even their rulers do not have
much esteem for the True Religion.It would be well for the Dessave
to go on circuit and himself inspect all the churches.Until he can
do so he may be guided by the reports with regard to these buildings
made by Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz on March 19 and April 4, 1696.He
must also be aware that the schoolmasters and merinhos have neglected
the gardens attached to the houses, which contain many fruit trees and
formerly yielded very good fruit, especially grapes, which served for
the refreshment of the clergymen and Scholarchen on their visits.(39)

The Civil Court or Land Raad has been instituted on account of the
large population, and because of the difficulty of settling their
disagreements, which cannot always be done by the Commandeur or the
Court of Justice, nor by the Dessave, because his jurisdiction is
limited to the amount of 100 Pordaus.[45] The sessions held every
Wednesday must not be omitted again, as happened during my absence
in Colombo on account of the indisposition of the President.This
Court consists at present of the following persons:--


Abraham Michielsz Biermans, Administrateur.Jan Fransz, Vryburger, Vice-President.Jan Lodewyk Stumphuis, Paymaster.Lucas de Lange, Vryburger.Louis Verwyk, Vryburger.J. L. Stumphuis, mentioned above, Secretary.The native members are Don Louis Poeder and Don Denis Nitsingeraye.The instructions issued for the guidance of the Land Raad may be found
with the documents relating to this college of 1661, in which are also
contained the various Ordinances relating to the official Secretaries
in this Commandement, all which must be strictly observed.As there is
no proper place for the assembly of the Land Raad nor for the meeting
of the Scholarchen, and as both have been held so far in the front room
of the house of the Dessave, where there is no privacy for either,
it will be necessary to make proper provision for this.The best
place would be in the town behind the orphanage, where the Company
has a large plot of land and could acquire still more if a certain
foul pool be filled up as ordered by His Excellency van Mydregt.A
building ought to be put up about 80 or 84 feet by 30 feet, with a
gallery in the centre of about 10 or 12 feet, so that two large rooms
could be obtained, one on either side of the gallery, the one for the
assembly of the Land Raad and the other for that of the Scholarchen.It
would be best to have the whole of the ground raised about 5 or 6
feet to keep it as dry as possible during the rainy season, while
at the entrance, in front of the gallery, a flight of stone steps
would be required.In order, however, that it may not seem as if I am
unaware of the order contained in the letter from Their Excellencies
of November 23, 1695, where the erection of no public building is
permitted without authority from Batavia, except at the private cost
of the builder, I wish to state here particularly that I have merely
stated the above by way of advice, and that Your Honours must wait for
orders from Batavia for the erection of such a building.I imagine
that Their Excellencies will give their consent when they consider
that masonry work costs the Company but very little in Jaffnapatam,
as may be seen in the expenditure on the fortifications, which was
met entirely by the chicos or fines, imposed on those who failed to
attend for the Oely service.Lime, stone, cooly labour, and timber
are obtained free, except palmyra rafters, which, however, are not
expensive.The chief cost consists in the wages for masonry work and
the iron, so that in respect of building Jaffnapatam has an advantage
over other places.Further instructions must however be awaited, as
none of the Company's servants is authorized to dispense with them.(40)

The Weesmeesteren (guardians of the orphans) will find the regulations
for their guidance in the Statutes of Batavia, which were published
on July 1, 1642, [46] by His Excellency the Governor-General Antonis
van Diemen and the Council of India by public placaat.This college
consists at present of the following persons:--


Pieter Chr.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.Johannes Huysman, Boekhouder.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger.the Government of India has been pleased to send
to Ceylon by letter of May 3, 1695, a special Ordinance for the
Orphan Chamber and its officials with regard to their salaries,
I consider it necessary to remind you of it here and to recommend
its strict observance, as well also of the resolution of March 20,
1696, whereby the Orphan Chamber is instructed that all such money
as is placed under their administration which is derived from the
estates of deceased persons who had invested money on interest with
the Company, and whose heirs were not living in the same place, must
be remitted to the Orphan Chamber at Batavia with the interest due
within a month or six weeks.(41)

The Commissioners of Marriage Causes will also find their instructions
in the Statutes of Batavia, mentioned above, which must be carefully
observed.Nothing need be said with regard to this College, but that
it consists of the following persons:--


Claas Isaacsz, Lieutenant, President.Lucas Langer, Vryburger, Vice-President.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.[42]


The officers of the Burgery, [47] the Pennisten, [48] and the
Ambachtsgezellen [49] will likewise find their instructions and
regulations in the Statutes of Batavia, and apply them as far as
applicable.[43]

The Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and the Wardens of the Town
(Brand and Wyk Meesteren) have their orders and distribution of work
publicly assigned to them by the Regulation of November 8, 1691,
upon which I need not remark anything, except that the following
persons are the present members of this body:--


Jan van Croenevelt, Fiscaal, President.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger, Vice-President.Lucas de Langer, Vryburger.[44]


The deacons, as caretakers of the poor, have been mentioned already
under the heading of the Consistory.During the last five and half
years they have spent Rds.1,145.3.7 more than they received.As I
apprehended this would cause inconvenience, I proposed in my letter
of December 1, 1696, to Colombo that the Poor House should be endowed
with the Sicos money for the year 1695, which otherwise would have
been granted to the Seminary, which did not need it then, as it had
received more than it required.Meantime orders were received from
Batavia that the funds of the said Seminary should be transferred
to the Company, so that the Sicos money could not be disposed of in
that way.As the deficit is chiefly due to the purchase, alteration,
and repairing of an orphanage and the maintenance of the children,
as may be seen from the letters to Colombo of December 12 and 17,
1696, to which expenditure the Deaconate had not been subject before
the year 1690, other means will have to be considered to increase
its funds in order to prevent the Deaconate from getting into further
arrears.It would be well therefore if Your Honours would carefully
read the Instructions of His late Excellency van Mydregt of November
29, 1690, and ascertain whether alimentation given to the poor by
the Deaconate has been well distributed and whether it really was of
the nature of alms and alimentation as it should be.A report of the
result of your inquiry should be sent to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council of Colombo.You might also state therein whether the
orphanage has not been sufficiently enlarged yet, for it seems to me
that the expenditure is too great for only 14 children, as there are
at present.It might also be considered whether the Company could not
find some source of income for the Deaconate in case this orphanage
is not quite completed without further expenditure, and care must be
taken that the deacons strictly observe the rules laid down for them
in the Regulation of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Ceylon of January 2, 1666.The present matron, Catharina Cornelisz,
widow of the late Krankbezoeker Dupree, must be directed to follow
the rules laid down for her by the Governor here on November 4, 1694,
and approved in Colombo.That all the inferior colleges mentioned
here successively have to be renewed yearly by the Political Council
is such a well-known matter that I do not think it would escape
your attention; but, as approbation from Colombo has to be obtained
for the changes made they have to be considered early, so that the
approbation may be received here in time.The usual date is June 23,
the day of the conquest of this territory, but this date has been
altered again to June 13, 1696, by His Excellency the Governor and
the Council of Colombo.[45]

The assessment of all measures and weights must likewise be renewed
every year, in the presence of the Fiscaal and Commissioners;
because the deceitful nature of these inhabitants is so great that
they seem not to be able to help cheating each other.The proceeds
of this marking, which usually amounts to Rds.70 or 80, are for the
largest part given to some deserving person as a subsistence.On my
arrival here I found that it had been granted to the Vryburger Jurrian
Verwyk, who is an old man and almost unable to serve as an assayer.The
post has, however, been left to him, and his son-in-law Jan Fransz,
also a Vryburger, has been appointed his assistant.The last time
the proceeds amounted to 80 rds.3 fannums, 8 tammekassen and 2 1/2
duyten, as may be seen from the report of the Commissioners bearing
date December 13, 1696.This amount has been disposed of as follows:--


        For the Assizer                      Rds.60.0.0.0
        For the assistant to the Assizer      "    6.0.0.0
        Balance to the Company's account      "   14.3.8.2 1/2
                                                  ============
                                    Total    Rds.80.3.8.2 1/2


It must be seen to that the Assizer, having been sworn, observes
his instructions as extracted from the Statutes of Batavia, as made
applicable to the customs of this country by the Government here on
March 3, 1666.In compliance with orders from Batavia contained in the letter of June
24, 1696, sums on interest may not be deposited with the Company here,
as may be seen also from a letter sent from here to Batavia on August
18 following, where it is stated that all money deposited thus must
be refunded.This order has been carried out, and the only deposits
retained are those of the Orphan Chamber, the Deaconate, the Seminary,
and the Widows' fund, for which permission had been obtained by letter
of December 15 of the same year.As the Seminary no longer possesses
any fund of its own, no deposit on that account is now left with
the Company.Your Honours must see that no other sums on interest
are accepted in deposit, as this Commandement has more money than
is necessary for its expenditure and even to assist other stations,
such as Trincomalee, &c., for which yearly Rds.16,000 to 18,000
are required, and this notwithstanding that Coromandel receives the
proceeds from the sale of elephants here, while we receive only the
money drafts.[46]

No money drafts are to be passed here on behalf of private persons,
whether Company's servants or otherwise, in any of the outstations,
but in case any person wishes to remit money to Batavia, this may be
done only after permission and consent obtained from His Excellency
the Governor at Colombo.When this is obtained, the draft is prepared
at Colombo and only signed here by the Treasurer on receipt of the
amount.This is specially mentioned here in order that Your Honours may
also remember in such cases the Instructions sent by the Honourable the
Government of India in the letters of May 3, 1695, and June 3, 1696,
in the former of which it is stated that no copper coin, and in the
latter that Pagodas are to be received here on behalf of the Company
for such drafts, each Pagoda being counted at Rds.[47]

The golden Pagoda is a coin which was never or seldom known to be
forged, at least so long as the King of Golconda or the King of the
Carnatic was sovereign in Coromandel.But the present war, which has
raged for the last ten years in that country, seems to have taken away
to some extent the fear of evil and the disgrace which follows it,
and to have given opportunity to some to employ cunning in the pursuit
of gain.It has thus happened that on the coast beyond Porto Novo,
in the domain of these lords of the woods (Boschheeren) or Paligares,
Pagodas have been made which, although not forged, are yet inferior
in quality; while the King of Sinsi Rama Ragie is so much occupied
with the present war against the Mogul, that he has no time to pay
attention to the doings of these Paligares.According to a statement
made by His Excellency the Governor Laurens Pyl and the Council of
Negapatam in their letter of November 4, 1695, five different kinds
of such inferior Pagodas have been received, valued at 7 3/8, 7 1/8,
7 5/8, 7 7/8, and 8 3/4 of unwrought gold.A notice was published
therefore on November 18, following, to warn the people against the
acceptance of such Pagodas, and prohibiting their introduction into
this country.When the Company's Treasury was verified by a Committee,
1,042 of these Pagodas were found.Intimation was sent to Colombo on
December 31, 1695.The Treasurer informed me when I was in Colombo
that he had sent them to Trincomalee, and as no complaints have been
received, it seems that the Sinhalese in that quarter did not know
how to distinguish them from the current Pagodas.As I heard that
the inferior Pagodas had been already introduced here, while it was
impossible to get rid of them, as many of the people of Jaffnapatam
and the merchants made a profit on them by obtaining them at a lower
rate in Coromandel and passing them here to ignorant people at the
full value, a banker from Negapatam able to distinguish the good from
the inferior coins has been asked to test all Pagodas, so that the
Company may not suffer a loss.But in spite of this I receive daily
complaints from Company's servants, including soldiers and sailors,
that they always have to suffer loss on the Pagodas received from
the Company in payment of their wages, when they present them at the
bazaar; while the chetties and bankers will never give them 24 fanums
for a Pagoda.This matter looks very suspicious, and may have an evil
influence on the Company's servants, because it is possible that the
chetties have agreed among themselves never to pay the full value
for Pagodas, whether they are good or bad.It is also possible that
the Company's cashier or banker is in collusion with the chetties,
or perhaps there is some reason for this which I am not able to
make out.However this may be, Your Honours must try to obtain as
much information as possible on this subject and report on it to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.All inferior
Pagodas found in the Company's Treasury will have to be made good by
the cashier at Coromandel, as it was his business to see that none
were accepted.With a view to prevent discontent among the Company's
servants the tax collectors must be made to pay only in copper and
silver coin for the poll tax and land rent, and out of this the
soldiers, sailors, and the lower grades of officials must be paid,
as I had already arranged before I left.I think that they can easily
do this, as they have to collect the amount in small instalments from
all classes of persons.The poor people do not pay in Pagodas, and the
collectors might make a profit by changing the small coin for Pagodas,
and this order will be a safeguard against loss both to the Company
and its servants.It would be well if Your Honours could find a means
of preventing the Pagodas being introduced and to discard those that
are in circulation already, which I have so far not been able to
do.Perhaps on some occasion you might find a suitable means.[48]

The demands received here from out-stations in this Commandement must
be met as far as possible, because it is a rule with the Company that
one district must accommodate another, which, I suppose, will be
the practice everywhere.Since His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo have authorized Your Honours in their letter of
June 13,1696, to draw directly from Coromandel the goods required from
those places for the use of this Commandement, Your Honours must avail
yourselves of this kind permission, which is in agreement with the
intention of the late Commissioner van Mydregt, who did not wish that
the order should pass through various hands.Care must be taken to send
the orders in due time, so that the supplies may not run out of stock
when required for the garrisons.The articles ordered from Jaffnapatam
for Manaar must be sent only in instalments, and no articles must be
sent but those that are really required, as instructed; because it
has occurred more than once that goods were ordered which remained
in the warehouses, because they could not be sold, and which, when
going bad, had to be returned here and sold by public auction, to
the prejudice of the Company.To give an idea of the small sale in
Manaar, I will just state here that last year various provisions and
other articles from the Company's warehouses were sent to the amount
of Fl.1,261.16.6--cost price--which were sold there at Fl.2,037,
so that only a profit of Fl.775.3.10 was made, which did not include
any merchandise, but only articles for consumption and use.[49]

The Company's chaloups [50] and other vessels kept here for the
service of the Company are the following:--


            The chaloup "Kennemerland.""'t Wapen van Friesland."The small chaloup "Manaar."Further, 14 tonys [51] and manschouwers, [52] viz.:--


            4 tonys for service in the Fort.1 tony  in Isle de Vacoa.in the islands "De Twee Gebroeders."Three manschouwers for the three largest chaloups, one manschouwer for
the ponton "De Hoop," one manschouwer for the ferry at Colombogamme,
one manschouwer for the ferry between the island Leiden and the fort
Kayts or Hammenhiel.The chaloups "Kennemerland" and "Friesland" are used mostly for the
passage between Coromandel and Jaffnapatam, and to and fro between
Jaffnapatam and Manaar, because they sink too deep to pass the river
of Manaar to be used on the west coast of Ceylon between Colombo and
Manaar.They are therefore employed during the northern monsoon to
fetch from Manaar such articles as have been brought there from Colombo
for this Commandement, and also to transport such things as are to
be sent from here to Colombo and Manaar, &c. They also serve during
the southern monsoon to bring here from Negapatam nely, cotton goods,
coast iron, &c., and they take back palmyra wood, laths, jagerbollen,
[53] coral stone, also palmyra wood for Trincomalee, and corsingos,
oil, cayro, [54] &c. The sloop "Jaffnapatam" has been built more
for convenience, and conveys usually important advices and money, as
also the Company's servants.As this vessel can be made to navigate
the Manaar river, it is also used as a cruiser at the pearl banks,
during the pearl fishery.It is employed between Colombo, Manaar,
Jaffnapatam, Negapatam, and Trincomalee, wherever required.The small
sloops "Manaar" and "De Visser," which are so small that they might
sooner be called boats than sloops, are on account of their small
size usually employed between Manaar and Jaffnapatam, and also for
inland navigation between the Passes and Kayts for the transport of
soldiers, money, dye-roots from The Islands, timber from the borders
of the Wanni, horses from The Islands; while they are also useful
for the conveyance of urgent advices and may be used also during the
pearl fishery.The sloop "Hammenhiel," being still smaller than the
two former, is only used for convenience of the garrison at Kayts,
the fort being surrounded by water.This and a tony are used to
bring the people across, and also to fetch drinking water and fuel
from the "Barren Island."The three pontons are very useful here,
as they have daily to bring fuel and lime for this Castle, and they
are also used for the unloading of the sloops at Kayts, where they
bring charcoal and caddegans, [55] and fetch lunt from the Passes,
and palmyra wood from the inner harbours for this place as well
as for Manaar and Colombo.They also bring coral stone from Kayts,
and have to transport the nely and other provisions to the redoubts
on the borders of the Wanni, so that they need never be unemployed
if there is only a sufficient number of carreas or fishermen for the
crew.At present there are 72 carreas who have to perform oely service
on board of these vessels or on the four tonies mentioned above.(50)

In order that these vessels may be preserved for many years, it
is necessary that they be keelhauled at least twice a year, and
rubbed with lime and margosa oil to prevent worms from attacking
them, which may be easily done by taking them all in turn.It must
also be remembered to apply to His Excellency the Governor and the
Council for a sufficient quantity of pitch, tar, sail cloth, paint,
and linseed oil, because I have no doubt that it will be an advantage
to the Company if the said vessels are kept constantly in repair.As
stated under the heading of the felling of timber, no suitable wood
is found in the Wanni for the parts of the vessels that remain under
water, and therefore no less than 150 or 200 kiate or angely boards of
2 1/2, 2, and 1 1/2 inches thickness are required yearly here for this
purpose.His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo have
promised to send this yearly, in answer to the request from Jaffnapatam
of February 17, 1692, and since this timber has to be obtained from
Mallabaar I will see whether I cannot send it directly by a private
vessel in case it cannot be obtained from Colombo.Application must be
made for Dutch sailors from Colombo to man the said sloops, which are
at present partly manned by natives for want of Europeans.According to
the latest regulation, 95 sailors are allowed for this Commandement,
while at present we have not even half that number, as only 46 are
employed, which causes much inconvenience in the service.The fortifications of the Castle have now for a few years been
complete, except the moat, which is being dug and has advanced to the
peculiar stratum of rocks which is found only in this country.All
matters relating to this subject are to be found in the Compendiums
for 1693, 1694, and 1695.Supposing that the moat could be dug to the
proper depth without danger to the fort, it could not be done in less
than a few years, and it cannot very well be accomplished with the
services of the ordinary oeliaars, so that other means will have to be
considered.If, on the other hand, the moat cannot be deepened without
danger to the foundations of the fort, as stated in the Compendium
for 1694, it is apparent that the project ought to be abandoned.In
that case the fort must be secured in some other way.The most natural
means which suggests itself is to raise the wall on all sides except
on the river side by 6 or 8 feet, but this is not quite possible,
because the foundation under the curtains of the fortification, the
faces of the bastion, and the flanks have been built too narrow,
so that only a parapet of about 11 feet is left, which is already
too small, while if the parapet were extended inward there would not
be sufficient space for the canons and the military.The best plan
would therefore be to cut away the hills that are found between the
Castle and the town.The earth might be thrown into the tank found
eastward of the Castle, while part of it might be utilized to fill
up another tank in the town behind the orphanage.This was the plan
of His Excellency van Mydregt, although it was never put down in
writing.Meantime care must be taken that the slaves and other native
servants of persons residing in the Castle do not through laziness
throw the dirt which they are supposed to carry away from the fort on
the opposite bank of the moat, and thus raise a space which the Company
would much rather lower, and gradually and imperceptibly prepare a
suitable place for the battery of an enemy.I have had notices put
up against this practice, under date July 18, 1695, and these must be
maintained and the offenders prosecuted.Considering the situation of
the Castle and the present appearance of the moat, I think that the
latter is already sufficiently deep if always four or five feet water
be kept in it.In order to do this two banks would have to be built,
as the moat has communication in two places with the river, while the
river also touches the fort at two points.This being done I think
the moat could be kept full of water by two or three water mills
driven by wind and pumps, especially during the south-west monsoon
or the dry season, when an attack would be most likely to occur,
and there is always plenty of wind to keep these mills going both
by night and day.A sluice would be required in the middle of these
banks so that the water may be let out whenever it became offensive
by the river running dry, to be filled again when the water rose.It
would have to be first ascertained whether the banks could really
be built in such a way that they would entirely stop the water in
the moat, because they would have to be built on one side against
the foundations of the fort, which I have been told consist of large
irregular rocks.An experiment could be made with a small mill of the
kind used in Holland in the ditches along bleaching fields.They are
quite inexpensive and easily erected and not difficult to repair,
as they turn on a dovetail.The late Commandeur Anthony Paviljoen
also appears to have thought of this plan even before this Castle was
built, when the Portuguese fort was occupied by the Company, as may
be seen from his instructions of December 19, 1665.[56] This would,
in my opinion, be the course to follow during the south-west monsoon,
while during the north-east monsoon there is usually so much rain that
neither the salt river nor the water mills would be required, while
moreover during that time there is little danger of an attack.These
three plans being adopted, the banks of the moat could be protected by
a wall of coral stone to prevent the earth being washed away by the
water, as the present rocky bed of the moat is sufficiently strong
to serve as a foundation for it.The moat has already been dug to
its proper breadth, which is 10 roods.In my opinion there are two other defects in this Castle: the one
is as regards the embrazures, the other is in the new horse stable
and carpenters' yard, which are on the south side just outside the
opposite bank of the moat.I think these ought to be altered, for
the reasons stated in our letter to Colombo of November 30, 1695.I
was however opposed by the Constable-Major Toorse in his letter of
December 16 next, and his proposal was approved in Batavia by letter
of July 3 following.This work will therefore have to remain as it is,
although it appears that we did not explain ourselves sufficiently;
because Their Excellencies seem to think that this yard and stable
were within the knowledge of His Excellency van Mydregt.It is true
that the plan for them was submitted to His Excellency, as may be seen
from the point submitted by the late Mr.Blom on February 17, 1692,
and April 29, 1691, but no answer was ever received with regard to
this matter, on account of the death of His Excellency van Mydregt,
[57] and I have an idea that they were not at all according to his
wish.However, the yard and stable will have to remain, and with
regard to the embrazures the directions of the Constable-Major must
be followed.If it be recommended that the deepening of the moat is possible
without danger to the fort, and if the plan of the water mills and
banks be not approved, so that a dry moat would have to suffice,
I think the outer wall might be completed and the ground between
the rocks be sown with a certain kind of thorn called in Mallabaar
Oldeaalwelam and in Dutch Hane sporen (cock spurs), on account of
their resemblance to such spurs in shape and stiffness.This would
form a covering of natural caltrops, because these thorns are so sharp
that they will penetrate even the soles of shoes, which, besides,
all soldiers in this country do not wear.Another advantage in these
thorns is that they do not easily take fire and do not grow higher
than 2 or 2 1/2 feet above the ground, while the plants grow in quite
a tangled mass.I thought it might be of some use to mention this here.The present bridge of the fort is built of palmyra wood, as I found
on my arrival from Batavia; but as the stone pillars have already
been erected for the construction of a drawbridge, this work must be
completed as soon as the timber that I ordered from the Wanni for this
purpose arrives.In the carpenters' yard some timber will be found that
was prepared three years ago for the frame of this drawbridge, which,
perhaps, could yet be utilized if it has been well preserved.This
work will have to be hurried on, for the present bridge is dangerous
for anything heavy to pass over it, such as elephants, &c. It will
also be much better to have a drawbridge for the fortification.The
bridge must be built as broad as the space between the pillars and
the opposite catches will permit, and it must have a strong wooden
railing on either side, which may be preserved for many years by
the application of pitch and tar, while iron is soon wasted in this
country unless one always has a large quantity of paint and linseed
oil.Yet, an iron railing is more ornamental, so I leave this matter
to Your Honours.[51]

The fortress Hammenhiel is in good condition, but the sand bank
upon which it is built has been undermined by the last storm in the
beginning of December during the north-east monsoon.The damage must
be remedied with stones.In this fortress a reservoir paved with
Dutch bricks has been built to collect and preserve the rain water,
but it has been built so high that it reaches above the parapets
and may thus be easily ruined by an enemy, as I have pointed out in
my letter to Colombo of September 8, 1694.As this is a new work it
will have to remain as present, until such time as alterations can
be made.The ramparts of this fortress, which are hollow, have been
roofed with beams, over which a floor of stone and chunam has been
laid, with a view to the space below being utilized for the storing
of provisions and ammunition.This is a mistake, as the beams are
liable to decay and the floor has to support the weight of the canon,
so that there would be danger in turning the guns round for fear of
the floor breaking down.So far back as the time of Commandeur Blom
a beginning was made to replace this roof by an entire stone vault,
which is an important work.The gate of the fortress, which is still
covered with beams, must also be vaulted.[52]

Ponneryn and the passes Pyl, Elephant, and Buschutter only
require a stone water tank, but they must not be as high as that of
Hammenhiel.Dutch bricks were applied for from Jaffnapatam on February
17, 1692, and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo
promised to send them here as soon as they should arrive from the
Fatherland, so that Your Honours must wait for these.Ponneryn is
not so much in want of a reservoir, as it has a well with fairly good
drink water.[53]

The work that demands the chief attention in Manaar is the deepening
of the moat, as the fortifications, dwelling houses, and stores are
completed.But since this work has to be chiefly carried out by the
Company's slaves, it will take some time to complete it.There are
also several elevations near the fort which will have to be reduced,
so that they may not at any time become a source of danger.During
my circuit on two or three occasions the Opperhoofd and the Council
at Manaar applied for lime to be sent from here, as no more coral
stone for the burning of lime was to be found there.This takes
away the Company's sloops from their usual employment, and the
officials have been informed that they must get the lime made
from the pearl shells which are found in abundance in the bay of
Condaatje as remains of the fishery.It makes very good lime, and
the forests in the neighbourhood provide the fuel, and the lime can
then be brought to Manaar in pontons and tonys.Information on this
subject may be found in the correspondence between this station and
Jaffnapatam.Care must be taken that the lime of the pearl shells
is used for nothing but the little work that has yet to be done in
the fort, such as the pavements for the canons and the floors of the
galleries in the dwelling houses.The Opperhoofd and other officers
who up to now have been living outside the fort must now move into
it, as there are many reasons why it is undesirable that they should
reside outside--a practice, besides, which is against the Company's
rules with regard to military stations in India.(54)

Provisions and ammunition of war are matters of foremost consideration
if we desire to have our minds at ease with regard to these stations,
for the one is necessary for the maintenance of the garrison and the
officials, while the other is the instrument of defence.These two
things ought at all times to be well provided.His late Excellency
van Mydregt for this reason very wisely ordered that every station
should be stocked with provisions for two years, as may be seen in
the letter sent from Negapatam bearing date March 17, 1688.This is
with regard to the Castle, but as regards the outstations it will be
sufficient if they are provided with rice for six or eight months.On
account of the great expense the Castle has not of late been provided
for two years, but this will soon be changed now that the passage to
Trincomalee and Batticaloa has been opened, even if the scarcity in
Coromandel should continue, or if the Theuver should still persist in
his prohibition of the importation of nely from Tondy.I have heard,
however, that this veto has been withdrawn, and that vessels with this
grain will soon arrive here.If this rumour be true and if a good
deal of rice is sent here from Cotjaar, Tammelegan, and Batticaloa,
a large quantity of it might be purchased on behalf of the Company
with authority of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo, which might be obtained by means of our sloops.Perhaps
also the people of Jaffnapatam who come here with their grain may be
prevailed upon to deliver it to the Company at 50 per cent.or so
less, as may be agreed upon.This they owe to their lawful lords,
since the Company has to spend so much in governing and protecting
them.Sanction to this measure was granted by His Excellency van
Mydregt in his letter from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of June 12, 1688,
which may be looked up.If a calculation be made of the quantity of
provisions required for two years, I think it would be found that it
is no less than 300 lasts of rice a year.This includes provisions
for the garrison and those who would have to come into the fort in
case of a siege, so that 600 lasts would be required for two years,
a last being equal to 3,000 lb.or 75 Ceylon parras, thus in all
45,000 parras.At the rate of one parra per month for each person,
1,875 people could be maintained for two years with this store of
rice.This would be about the number of people the Company would
have to provide for in case of necessity, considering that there are
according to the latest regulations 600 Company's servants, while
there are according to the latest enumeration 1,212 women, children,
and slaves in the town, making a total of 1,812 persons who have to be
fed; so that the above calculation is fairly correct.Sometimes also
Manaar will have to be provided, because Mantotte does not yield a
sufficient quantity of nely to supply that fort for two years.This
must also be included in the calculation, and if Your Honours are
well provided in this manner you will be in a position to assist some
of the married soldiers, the orphanage, and the poor house with rice
from the Company's stores in times of scarcity, and will be able to
prevent the sale in rice being monopolized again.It was the intention
of His Excellency van Mydregt that at such times the Company's stores
should be opened and the rice sold below the bazaar price.Care must
be taken that this favour is not abused, because it has happened
that some of the Company's servants sent natives on their behalf,
who then sold the rice in small quantities at the market price.This
was mentioned in our letter to Colombo of October 1 and December 12,
1695.The Company can hardly have too much rice in store, for it can
always be disposed of with profit when necessary, and therefore I think
600 lasts need not be the limit, so long as there is a sufficient
number of vessels available to bring it.But as rice alone will not
suffice, other things, such as salt, pepper, bacon, meat, &c., must
also be considered.Salt may be obtained in sufficient quantities
in this Commandement, but pepper has to be obtained from Colombo,
and therefore this spice must never be sold or issued from the store
houses until the new supply arrives, keeping always 3,000 or 4,000
lb.Bacon and meat also have to be obtained from Colombo,
and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo were kind
enough to send us on my verbal request ten kegs of each from Galle
last August by the ship "Nederland."But I find that it has become
stale already, and it must be changed for new as soon as possible,
with authority of His Excellency and the Council, in order that it may
not go further bad.In compliance with the orders of His Excellency
van Mydregt in his letter of November 23, 1687, the old meat and
bacon must be returned to Colombo, and a new supply sent here every
three or four years, the stale meat being supplied in Colombo to
some of the Company's vessels.But considering that His Excellency
the Governor and the Council of Colombo are not always in a position
to supply Jaffnapatam with a sufficient quantity of meat and bacon,
as there are so many other stations in Ceylon to be provided for,
it would be well to keep in mind the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen
that in emergencies 1,000 or 1,200 cattle could be captured and kept
within the fort, where they could be made to graze on the large plain,
while as much straw from the nely would have to be collected as could
be got together to feed these animals as long as possible.This
small loss the inhabitants would have to bear, as the Company has to
protect them and their lands, and if we are victorious a recompense
could be made afterwards.I would also advise that as much carrawaat
[58] as could be found in the quarters of the Carreas, Palwelys,
[59] and other fishermen should be brought into the fort; because
this dried fish makes a very good and durable provision, except
for the smell.The provision of arrack must also not be forgotten,
because used moderately this drink does as much good to our people as
it does harm when taken in large quantities.As I have heard so many
complaints about the arrack here, as well as in Trincomalee, at the
pearl fishery, at Coromandel, &c., it is apparent that the Company is
not properly served in this respect.On this account also some arrack
was returned from Negapatam and the Bay of Condaatje.Henceforth
no arrack must be accepted which has not been tested by experts,
neither for storing in the warehouses nor for sending to the different
stations, because at present I cannot say whether it is adulterated by
the people who deliver it to the Company or by those who receive it
in the stores, or even by those who transport it in the sloops.With
regard to the munitions of war, I think nothing need be stated here,
but that there is a sufficient stock of it, because by the last stock
taking on August 31, 1696, it appears that there is a sufficient
store of canons, gun-carriages, gunpowder, round and long grenades,
instruments for storming, filled fire bombs, caseshot-bags, martavandes
for the keeping of gunpowder, and everything that pertains to the
artillery.The Arsenal is likewise sufficiently provided with guns,
muskets, bullets, native side muskets, &c. I would only recommend that
Your Honours would continue to have ramrods made for all the musket
barrels which are still lying there, suitable timber for which may be
found in the Wanni.It is from there also that the boards are obtained
for gun-carriages.And as I found that some had not been completed,
I think this work ought to be continued, so that they may be ready
when wanted.No doubt His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo will be willing to send a sufficient quantity of pitch and
tar for the preservation both of the sloops and the gun-carriages,
which otherwise will soon decay during the heavy rains which we have
here in India.Although the Arsenal is at present well provided with
guns and muskets, it is possible that half of them may be found unfit
for use.I have therefore given orders to examine them all carefully,
so that those that are unfit may be sent to Colombo and from there to
the Fatherland, and new ones returned.Water and fuel are also two of
the most important things to think of for the defence of a fortress,
and I had therefore a large room built behind the smith's shop where
fuel could be stored away.This room must be stocked and closed, and
no fuel issued from it to any one.Those who receive firewood from
the Company may be supplied from that which is daily brought from the
forest.With regard to the water which is found within this Castle,
it is drinkable in cases of emergency, especially in some of the
wells found there.[55]

The military and garrison would be sufficiently strong if the full
number of Europeans allowed for this Commandement by the latest
Batavian regulation of December 29, 1692, could be obtained, which
could not be considered too strong for a Commandement numbering
608 men in all, including those for commercial, civil, judicial,
ecclesiastical, naval, and military services.At present we have only
the following number of persons in the Company's service, who have
to be classified, as they are of different colour and descent, viz.:--


                            Europeans.In the Castle              287         56        7       350
    In Manaar                   52          2        9        63
    In Hammenhiel               21          4        1        26
    In Ponneryn                  1          1       21        23
    In the redoubts the
    "Pyl," "Beschutter,"
    and "Elephant"              11          3       45        59
    For various services,
    also in the Island,
    for  surveying, wood
    felling, &c.13         10        2        25
                               ===        ===      ===       ===
                    Total      385         76       85       546


In the number of Europeans is included, as stated above, all manner
of Company's servants employed in the Trade, Church, Navigation,
Military Duties, &c., all of which together number 385 men.The 76
mestises and the 85 toepasses will therefore have to be retained until
this Commandement can have its full number of Europeans, and it would
be well if Your Honours would continue to engage a few more toepasses
when they offer themselves, because the Passes are hardly sufficiently
guarded; about which matter communication has been made in our letter
to Colombo of March 5, 1695.Your Honours must also keep in mind the
recommendation of His Excellency van Mydregt in his letter of March
27, 1688, wherein he suggests that a close watch should be kept on
the Wannias, as they are not to be trusted in a case of treason on
the part of the Sinhalese; and on this account the advanced guards
must be always well provided with ammunition and provisions, while
discipline and drill must be well attended to, so that as far as lies
in our power we may be prepared for emergencies.I have been rather prolix in treating of the fortifications and all
that pertains thereto, not so much because I am ignorant of the fact
that the Company's power in India depends more on her naval force
than on her fortresses, but because I consider that since the latter
are in our possession it is our duty to preserve them, as otherwise
the large amount expended on them at the beginning of the Government
in Ceylon would have been spent in vain.[56]

The public works are carried out here without expenditure to the
Company by the Oeliaars, because, as stated before, no cooly wages
are paid here, payment being made only to the native artisans, such
as smiths, carpenters, and masons.The number of men employed is
daily entered in a book by one of the Pennisten of the Comptoirs,
which he has to hand over in the evening to the person whose turn
it will be the next day to do this work.Care must be taken that
these assistants personally see and count the men, and the payments
must be made according to their list and not according to those of
the Dutch foremen or the native Cannecappuls.This is in compliance
with the orders from Batavia.The foremen of the carpenters' yard,
the smiths' shop, the gunpowder mill, and the masonry works must
also every evening, at sunset, bring in their reports with regard to
the progress of the work.This is to be done by the sergeant Hendrik
Rademaker, who, for some years, has been acting as overseer of the
Oeliaars.The Oeliaars are changed on Mondays and Thursdays, each
of them working only for three days at a time, which suffices for
three months, as they owe twelve days of service in the year.Those
who have performed their labour receive an ola from the Cannecappul,
which is called a Sito, and is marked with a steel stamp thus: I-VOC,
which serves them as a receipt.The names of those who fail to appear
are written down by the Cannecappul and by the Majoraal, and they
have to pay a fine which is called sicos.[60] The stamp is in the
custody of the Chief, who also arranges and divides the work among
the Oeliaars.He must see that the sergeant does not allow any of
the coolies to depart before the three days have expired, and making
a profit for himself and causing loss to the Company.Care must also
be taken that no more than 18 persons are employed as Pandarepulles
or native cooly drivers, who are each in charge of 16 to 30 men,
whom they have to keep to their work.These 18 Pandarepulles must be
appointed by written documents, otherwise the sergeant appoints such
officers on his own authority and thus also makes a profit.Then
also it must be seen that the materials, such as timber, bricks,
lime, &c., are not taken to other places than they have been ordered
for by the person in authority, for all these are tricks to which
the Company is subject on the part of the overseers when they see
that no regard is taken of their doings.The principal of the public
works at present in progress is the building of the church within the
fort, [61] which has advanced to 8 feet above the ground, and may be
completed during the southern season, if there is only a sufficient
quantity of bricks.According to my calculation about 1,000,000 more
will be required, which is a large quantity, but will not cost more
than 3 fannums per thousand, and even this expense does not fall to
the Company, but may be found out of the sicos or fines.The Dessave
has the best opportunity for seeing that the work at the brickworks
at Iroewale is pushed on as quickly as possible, so that there may
be no waiting for bricks or tiles, which are also baked there and
paid at the rate of 3 1/2 fannums a thousand.I consider it a shame
that in a country where the cost of building is so small, and where
religion is to be promoted, there should not even be a church in
the fort, a state of things that has existed these last four years,
during which the warehouses had to be used for this purpose, while
many old and infirm people could not attend the services because of
the inconvenience of the steps that lead to them.It would have been
better if the old Portuguese church had not been broken down before
the building of the new church was commenced, because an old proverb
says: "That one must not cast away old shoes till one has got new
ones."[62] However, for the present we must row with the oars we
possess, until the new church is completed, the plan for which is in
the hands of the surveyor Martinus Leusekam.The sergeant in the Wanni,
Harmen Claasz, had already on my orders felled the necessary beams,
and now the rafters must be thought of, which would be best made
of palmyra wood, if they could be obtained sufficiently long.The
timber for the pulpit I hope to send from Mallabaar, but as ebony is
also found in the Wanni, some trees might be felled also there and be
brought down here without expenditure to the Company.As may be seen
in the answers to the questions from Jaffnapatam of March 12, 1691,
and February 17, 1692, authority for the building of this church was
obtained long ago.The only other works required within the Castle
at present are the barracks for the married soldiers; which may be
found indicated in the map, and the rebuilding of the four dwelling
houses yet remaining of the Portuguese buildings which are old and
decayed.They are no longer worth repairing, and it would be best
if they were broken down and new and better houses built on their
site.But before this is done it will be necessary to rebuild the
Armoury, which fell into ruins last December.This building also
remained from the Portuguese.Some new tiles are also required for
the Company's building at Anecatte where the red-dyeing is done,
the cross-beams of which building I had renewed.Likewise a number
of tiles is required for the new warehouses in the island Leyden,
which have been built there in compliance with the orders of His
late Excellency van Mydregt.This was when it was intended to provide
Ceylon with grain from Tansjouwer, [63] which was to be laid up there
before the northern season.These warehouses may yet come in useful
if the Moorish trade flourishes.[57]

The horse stable within the fort has been built in a bad place,
and is very close and unhealthy; so that the animals die one after
another.It would therefore be better if the stable referred to
under the heading of "fortification" and situated outside the fort be
used.If this is done it must be provided with the necessary cribs,
&c., and not more than seven horses have been allowed by the last
regulation.The supervision of the stable has been entrusted for some
time to the Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but I could not approve of
this, and consider it better that this supervision be also left to
the chief person in authority, the more so as the said Captain has
been troubled for the last five years with gout and gravel; so that
he has often to remain at home for weeks, while, even when he is well,
it is impossible for him to go about much, in consequence of weakness
arising from the pain.For this reason he cannot properly supervise
the stable; and this is not the first time he is excused from his
duty, as it was done also during the time of Commandeur Cornelis van
der Duyn, who also considered that it was more in the interest of
the Company that this and other duties should be performed by the
chief instead of by private persons.The Dessave is best aware if
the hides of the stags and elks sent to this stable from the Wanny
and the Passes are properly utilized for saddles, carriages, &c.,
in the said stable, and also in the Arsenal for cartridge cases,
bandoleers, sword-belts, &c.[58]

The hospital was built too low, so that the patients had to lie in
damp places during the northern monsoon.I therefore had the floor
raised, in view of the fact that this is a place where the Company
shows its sympathy with its suffering servants and wishes them to have
every comfort.For this reason also regents are appointed to see that
nothing wrong is done by the doctor or the steward.For some time this
supervision was entrusted to Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but for the
reason stated above I cannot approve of the arrangement any longer,
while moreover, his daughter is the wife of the Chief Surgeon Hendrick
Warnar, who has a very large family, and suspicious people might try to
find fault with the arrangement.The supervision of the hospital must
therefore be entrusted every alternate month to the Administrateur
Biermans and the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, as it is against the
principles of the Company to entrust such work to one person only.[59]

The Company's slaves here are few in number, consisting of 82
individuals, including men, boys, women, and children.But no more are
required, as the Oeliaars perform many of the duties for which slaves
would be otherwise required.They are employed in the stable, the
warehouses, the arsenal, the hospital, and with the shipbuilders and
masons.The only pay they receive is 3 fannums and a parra of rice per
month, except some of the masons.This payment is sufficient for some
of them, but not for all, as there are some employed in masonry work
who do their work as well as any of the natives, and, as they have to
maintain a wife and children, the master mason has often recommended
higher pay for them.There is one among the masons who receives
6 fannums a month, another gets 4, and two others 3 fannums.This
might be raised from 6 to 10, from 4 to 8, and from 3 to 6 fannums
respectively, so that these poor people may not be discouraged; and on
the other hand increased pay often produces increased labour, and thus
the Company would perhaps not lose by the extra expense.The matter
must, however, be submitted to His Excellency the Governor, as also
the request of one of the masons that his daughter may be emancipated,
in order to marry a native who has proposed to her.The father offers
in her place as a slave another young and capable woman.There is also
another application for emancipation from a dyer who is now, he says,
60 years of age.The Company would lose nothing in granting this
request, because all he delivers is two or three pieces of ordinary
chintz a year.All these matters must be submitted to His Excellency
the Governor and the Council.[60]

Having now treated of the Wanny, of the lands of Ponneryn and Mantotte
within the Province of Jaffnapatam, and of the fort, we must see what
is to be said with regard to the seacoast, and also if any important
matter has been forgotten.Manaar is the last island on this side, and the banks and islets near
it form together what is called "Adam's Bridge," which closes the
passage between Ceylon and Coromandel.This island also protects
Jaffnapatam on the south, as no vessel could come here without
passing Manaar.The passage through the river is so inconvenient on
account of its shallowness that no vessel can pass without being first
unloaded.Therefore no vessel is able to pass nor any smuggling take
place without its being known in Manaar.It is on this account that
an order was issued by His Excellency the Governor and the Council
in their letter of March 5, 1695, to Jaffnapatam, to the effect that
no smuggled areca-nut from Colombo or Calpentyn must be allowed to
pass there.This was when the trade in these waters was re-opened
for private enterprise from Coromandel, and the order was conveyed
by us to Manaar by letter of March 11.A close watch must be kept,
but so long as the passage of Ramacoil or Lembe in the domain of the
Teuver is so well known by some people as it is said to be, it is
not likely that attempts at smuggling would be made in Manaar.[61]

Manaar not only protects Jaffnapatam, but it also yields to the
Company the profits of Mantotte, Moesely, and Setticoulang, and of
the capture of elephants.The latter might be more if not for the
death of the animals, as, for instance, last year, when not a single
animal delivered by the hunters survived.The hunters must therefore
be encouraged to bring as many as possible.[62]

About 50 or 60 bharen of dye-roots are also yearly obtained from
Manaar, which cultivation must also be attended to, in order that
the Company may be in a position to deliver the red cloths ordered
from this Commandement.[63]

Some revenue is also obtained from taxes and rents.These are yearly
sold to the highest bidder.Last year they were sold for 1 1/2 year,
like those in Jaffnapatam.2,268, as also
Rds.879.7.8 for poll tax and land rent in Manaar.The tithes of the
harvest in Mantotte are paid in grain, which is usually issued to the
Company's servants.This amounted on the last occasion to 1,562 1/2
paras of rice.The tax in cooking butter in Mantotte is also paid
in kind and likewise issued to the Company's servants.Besides,
there are 3,000 or 4,000 paras of salt and 10,000 or 12,000 coils
of straw or bark lunt which the inhabitants of the opposite lands
have to deliver, as also chanks from the divers; but these do not
amount to much, for, in 1695, were dived five kinds of cauries to
the amount of 204 5/8 paras, and in 1696 only 94 7/8 paras; so that
the amount for two years was only 299 1/2 paras of cauries.For this
reason I submitted on May 10, 1695, to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council, a proposal from the Moor Perietamby, who offered to
pay the Company yearly Rds.8,000 for the license to dive for chanks
between Manaar and Calpentyn.This was refused by the reply received
from Colombo on the 17th of the same month.[64]

From the Instructions to Commandeur Blom sent from Colombo on February
17, 1692, it may be seen what prices are paid to the divers for the
chanks, mentioned already under the subject of the Moorish trade,
so that it is not necessary to enter into detail on the subject here.I think that I have now sufficiently explained all matters relating to
this station, and would refer for further information to the report
compiled by Mr.Blom for Governor van Mydregt, which is kept here at
the Secretariate, [64] as also the answers thereto of September 13 and
October 7, 1690.Jorephaas
Vosch for the Opperkoopman Jan de Vogel, bearing date August 30, 1666,
[65] which may also be read, but I think that I have mentioned all
the most important matters with regard to Manaar appearing therein.The pearl fishery is an extraordinary enterprise, the success of
which depends on various circumstances; as there are various causes
by which the banks or the oysters may be destroyed.It would take too
long to mention here all that may be said on the subject, and as it
would be tiresome to read it all, I will merely state here that the
usual place for the fishery is near Aripo in the Bay of Condaatje,
where the banks lie, and if no untoward events take place, a fishery
may be held for several years in succession; because the whole bay
is covered with different banks, the oysters of which will become
successively matured.But sometimes they are washed away and completely
destroyed within a very short time.The banks are to be inspected in
November by a Commission sent for this purpose, who come in tonys from
Jaffnapatam, Manaar, and Madura, and with them also some Patangatyns
and other native chiefs who understand this work.The chief points to
be considered when a pearl fishery has been authorized are the lodgings
for the Commissioners appointed in Colombo; the inclosure of the tanks
in Mantotte with banks for obtaining good drinking water; the supply
of poultry, butter, oil, rice, sheep, cattle, &c., for provisions;
Lascoreens and servants; military men, if they can be spared from
the garrison, &c. The fishery usually takes place in the months of
March, April, and May.I will not enter into detail on this matter,
as it would not be in agreement with the nature of these instructions;
while the Commissioners will be able to find ample information in the
various documents of the years 1666 and 1667, but especially in those
of 1694, 1695, and 1696, including reports, journals, and letters, in
case they have not gained sufficient experience yet.These documents
relate to the fishery, the collection of the Company's duties, the
purchase and valuation of pearls, &c. I will therefore only state
here the successive profits derived from the pearl fishery by the
Company, viz.:--


                   Rds.1666       19,655    91/980       58,965.11.6
        1667       24,641   461/968       73,924.8.13
        1694       21,019    19/60        63,057.13.0
        1695       24,708    11/12        74,126.15.0
        1696       25,327    43/60        75,983.0
                  =======   =======      =============
           Total  115,352   499/960      346,057.11.3 [66]


This is a considerable amount, and it is expected, according to the
reports of the Commissioners, that the fishery now authorized for
December 31, 1697, will yield still greater profits.I have already
given orders for the repair of the banks of the tanks in Mantotte,
which were damaged during the last storm, in order that there may
be no want of drinking water, which is one of the most important
points.Whether the prohibition to export coconuts from this Province
applies also to the pearl fishery is a matter to be submitted to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council; because many people use
this fruit as food.This subject has been already dealt with under
the head of Coconuts.[65]

The inhabited little islands are considered as the fifth Province
of the Commandement, the others being Walligammo, Waddemoraatsche,
Timmeraatsche, and Patchelepalle.Taxes, &c., are levied in these
islands in the same way as in the other Provinces, the revenue
amounting last time to Rds.2,767.2.5 1/2, viz.:--


                                              Rds.Land rent                                1,190.11.3
    Tithes                                     712.8.6 1/4
    Poll tax                                   605.1.0
    Adigary                                    173.9.0
    Officie                                    162.5.8 3/4
                                             --------------
                               Total         2,844.11.8

    Deducted as salaries for the Collector,
    Majoraal, Cayals, &c.9.2 1/4
                                             ==============
                               Total         2,767.2.5 1/2 [67]


The islands are named as follows:--

Carredive, called by us Amsterdam; Tamiedive, Leyden; Pongedive,
Middleburg; Nerendive, Delft; Neynadive, Haarlem; Aneledive, Rotterdam;
Remedive, "de Twee Gebroeders," or Hoorn and Enkhuisen.Besides the revenue stated above, Carredive yields the best dye-roots
in this Commandement, although the quantity is no more than 10 or
12 bharen a year.The dye-roots from Delft are just as good, but it
yields only 4 or 5 bharen a year.Salt, lime, and coral stone are
also obtained from these islands, but particulars with regard to these
matters have been stated at length in the report by the late Commandeur
Blom to His late Excellency van Mydregt, to which I would refer.[66]

Horse-breeding is an enterprise of which much was expected, but so far
the Company has not made much profit by it.Yet there is no reason
to despair, and better results may be hoped for.Your Honours must
remember that formerly in the islands Delft, Hoorn, and Enkhuizen all
kinds of horses were bred together; so that but few good animals were
obtained.In 1690 and 1691 orders were given to shoot all horses that
were too small or defective, and to capture the rest and send them to
Colombo and Coromandel.The latter were sold at Negapatam by public
auction, while the rest were given to soldiers on the opposite coast
in the Company's service, who used the animals so badly that they were
soon unfit for work.In this way the islands have become destitute
of horses, and the only thing to be done was to send there some good
mares and two or three Persian stallions for breeding purposes.So
far no good horses could be obtained, because a foal has to be 4 or
3 1/2 years old before it is fit for use.It is only since 1692,
1693, and 1694 that we had good stallions, and this accounts for
the fact that no foals have yet been obtained.8,982.9, so that it would seem as if expenditure and
trouble are the only results to be expected from this enterprise;
but it must be remembered that at present there are on the island of
Delft alone about 400 or 500 foals of 1, 1 1/2, 2, and 2 1/2 years
old, while there are also a number of horses on the island "de Twee
Gebroeders."The expenditure was incurred mostly in the purchase of the
Persian stallions, and this expenditure has not been in vain, because
we possess now more than 400 horses, each of which will be worth about
a hundred guilders, so that the whole number will be worth about 40,000
guilders.In compliance with the orders by His Excellency van Mydregt
of November 29, 1690, these animals must be sold at Coromandel on
account of this Commandement, and the valuation of the horses may be
determined from the fact that the Prince of Tansjour has accepted one
or two of them in lieu of the recognition which the Company owes him
yearly for two Arabian horses.For this reason and in compliance with
the said orders the first horses captured must be sent to Negapatam,
so that the account in respect of horse-breeding may be balanced.As
the stallions kept on the islands have become too old, application
has been made for younger animals, and also for five or six mares
from Java, which have been granted by His Excellency the Governor
and the Council in their letter of April 29, 1695.Your Honours are
further advised not to sell any horses from the island of Delft for
less than Rds.25 and from the islands "de Twee Gebroeders" for less
than Rds.35 to the Company's servants, as they fetch more than that
at the public auctions in Negapatam.Even this is a favour to them;
but I noticed that the horses from Delft have been sold at 15 and
those from Hoorn and Enkhuisen at Rds.20, which I think cannot be
done in future, since the destruction of the defective animals has
improved the race.I hope that this will clear up the passage with
regard to the horse-breeding in the letter from Batavia to Ceylon of
July 3, 1696, as also that Their Excellencies may be satisfied with
the result.I think expectations were raised too high at first; as
the real advantage could only be known in course of time; while, on
the other hand, the capital expended must be looked upon as standing
out on interest.[67]

The Passes of this Commandement are various, but all are guarded in
such a way that no goods can be brought in or taken out without a
license, nor are people able to go through without a passport.At
Kayts and Point Pedro passports are issued in the usual way to
those who come or go by sea; while to those who travel by land an
Acte of Permission is issued, which is written in Mallabaar on ola,
and is called Cayoppe.These are issued both by the Dessave and by
the Commandeur, but as so many thousands of people come and go, and
the signing of these Cayoppes occupies so much of the time of the
Commandeurs, a steel stamp is used now by the Dessave to mark these
also.I have followed the same practice, and used a seal with the
letters H. Z., [68] which I handed over shortly before my departure for
Colombo in February, 1696, to the Political Council, together with the
seal for the oely service, with instructions that these seals were to
be used just as if I were still on the spot, because the Dessave was
absent at the pearl fishery, and I was commissioned by the Supreme
Government of India to proceed to Mallabaar without being formally
relieved of my office in this Commandement.On my return from Colombo
in August I found that this order had not been carried out, but that
the Captain Jan van der Bruggen had thought it well to have another
seal specially made, with the monogram VOC, not only suppressing my
order given to him in full Council, but also having a new seal made,
which was beyond his authority and seemed to me quite out of place.I
cannot account for his extraordinary conduct in any other way than by
supposing that he desired to confirm the rumour which had been spread
among the natives and Europeans during the time of the Commissioners
Messrs.Jan van Keulen and Pieter Petitfilz, that I would never return
to this Commandement to rule, and thus by suppressing my seal to give
public confirmation to this rumour, and so make it appear to the world
that it was no longer legal.I therefore order again that this seal is
not to be suppressed, but used for the stamping of the Cayoppes at the
Passes in case the Dessave should be absent from this Commandement,
it being his province alone to issue and sign such olas.This order
is to be carried out as long as no contrary orders are received from
higher authorities.Colomboture and Catsay are two Passes on the inner boundary of this
Commandement at the river leading to Ponneryn and the Wanny, and
in order to prevent any one passing without a passport a guard is
stationed there.The duties on goods are also collected there, being
leased out, but they do not amount to much.These Passes, however,
must be properly guarded, and care taken that the people stationed
there submit their reports regularly.One of these may be found in
a letter from here to Colombo of December 12 last.Ponneryn, a good redoubt, serves as a place from where to watch the
doings of the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from invasions.It
is garrisoned by Toepasses under the command of a Dutch Sergeant.The Passes Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter serve chiefly to close this
Province against the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from
invasions of the Sinhalese, and also to prevent persons passing in
or out without a passport, or goods being taken in or out without a
license, as also to prevent the theft of slaves and the incursions of
elephants and other wild animals into the Provinces.A difficulty is
that the earth mounds are not close together, so that notwithstanding
the continual patrol of the militia, now and again a person passes
through unnoticed.Means of drawing these redoubts together, or at
least of making a trench to prevent persons or goods from passing
without a license, have often been considered.Some have proposed
a hedge of palmyra trees, others a fence of thorns, others a moat,
others again a wall, because at this point the Commandement measures
only two miles in breadth.But none of these proposals have been
adopted all these years, as stated in our letter of August 24, 1695,
to Batavia.Their Excellencies replied in their letter of July 3,
1696, that this is a good work, but as it is entirely to the advantage
of the inhabitants it must be carried out without expense to the
Company.This, in my humble opinion, is quite fair, and the Dessave,
whom this matter principally concerns, will have to consider in what
way such a trench as proposed could be made.The yearly Compendium
will give much information on this subject, and will show what defects
and obstacles have been met with.It has been stated already how the
Passes are garrisoned, and they are commanded by an Ensign according
to the regulations.Point Pedro, on the outer boundary of this Commandement, has resident
only one Corporal and four Lascoreens, who are chiefly employed in
the sending and receiving of letters to and from Coromandel and
Trincomalee, in the loading of palmyra wood and other goods sent
from there to the said two places, and in the search of departing
and arriving private vessels, and the receipt of passports.These men
also supervise the Oeliaars who have to work at the church which was
commenced during the time of Commandeur Blom, and also those who have
to burn lime or break coral stone from the old Portuguese fortress.The fortress Kayts or Hammenhiel serves on the north, like Manaar
in the south, to guard the passage by water to this Castle, and
also serves the same purposes as Point Pedro, viz., the searching of
private vessels, &c. Next to this fort is the island Leyden, where is
stationed at present the Assistant Jacob Verhagen, who performs the
same duties as the Corporal at Point Pedro, which may be found stated
more in detail in the Instructions of January 4, 1696, compiled and
issued by me for the said Assistant.The Ensign at the Passes received
his instructions from Commandeur Blom, all of which must be followed.As the Dessave is Commander over the military scattered in the
country, and therefore also over those stationed at the said Passes
and stations, it will chiefly be his duty to see that they are
properly guarded so far as the small garrison here will permit,
and also that they are provided with sufficient ammunition and
provisions.The latter consist mostly of grain, oil, pepper, and
arrack.This is mostly meant for Hammenhiel, as the other places can
always be provided from the land side, but rice and ammunition must be
always kept in store.Hammenhiel must be specially garrisoned during
the southern monsoon, and be manned as much as possible by Dutchmen,
who, if possible, must be transferred every three months, because many
of these places are very unhealthy and others exceedingly lonesome,
for which reasons it is not good to keep the people very long in one
place.The chief officers are transferred every six months, which also
must not be neglected, as it is a good rule in more than one respect.Aripo, Elipoecarrewe, and Palmeraincattoe were formerly fortresses
garrisoned like the others, but since the revolution of the Sinhalese
and the Wannias of 1675, under the Dessave Tinnekon, these have
become unnecessary and are only guarded now by Lascoreens, who are
mostly kept on for the transport of letters between Colombo, Manaar,
and Jaffnapatam.[68]

Water tanks are here very necessary, because the country has no fresh
water rivers, and the water for the cultivation of lands is that which
is collected during the rainfall.Some wealthy and influential natives
contrived to take possession of the tanks during the time the Company
sold lands, with a view of thus having power over their neighbours
and of forcing them to deliver up to them a large proportion of their
harvests.They had to do this if they wished to obtain water for
the cultivation of their fields, and were compelled thus to buy at
high price that which comes as a blessing from the Lord to all men,
plants, and animals in general.His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then
Governor of Ceylon, issued an order in June, 1687, on his visit to
this Commandement, that for these reasons no tanks should be private
property, but should be left for common use, the owners being paid
by those who require to water their fields as much as they could
prove to have spent on these tanks.I found that this good order
has not been carried out, because the family of Sangere Pulle alone
possesses at present three such tanks, one of which is the property
of Moddely Tamby.Before my departure to Colombo I had ordered that
it should be given over to the surrounding landowners, who at once
offered to pay the required amount, but I heard on my return that
the conveyance had not been made yet by that unbearably proud and
obstinate Bellale caste, they being encouraged by the way their patron
Moddely Tamby had been favoured in Colombo, and the Commandeur is
not even recognized and his orders are passed by.Your Honours must
therefore see that my instructions with regard to these tanks are
carried out, and that they are paid for by those interested, or that
they are otherwise confiscated, in compliance with the Instructions
of 1687 mentioned above, which Instructions may be found among the
papers in the Mallabaar language kept by the schoolmasters of the
parishes.Considering that many of the Instructions are preserved in
the native language only, they ought to be collected and translated
into our Dutch language.[69]

The public roads must be maintained at a certain breadth, and the
natives are obliged to keep them in order.But their meanness and
impudence is so great that they have gradually, year by year, extended
the fences along their lands on to these roads, thus encroaching
upon the high road.They see more and more that land is valuable on
account of the harvests, and therefore do not leave a foot of ground
uncultivated when the time of the rainy season is near.This is quite
different from formerly; so much so, that the lands are worth not
only thrice but about four or five times as much as formerly.This
may be seen when the lands are sold by public auction, and it may
be also considered whether the people of Jaffnapatam are really so
badly off as to find it necessary to agitate for an abatement of the
tithes.The Dessave must therefore see that these roads are extended
again to their original breadth and condition, punishing those who
may have encroached on the roads.[70]

The Company's elephant stalls have been allowed to fall into decay
like the churches, and they must be repaired as soon as possible,
which is also a matter within the province of the Dessave.[71]

Great expectations were cherished by some with regard to the thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Besoar stones, Carret, and tusks from the
elephants that died in the Company's stalls, but experience did
not justify these hopes.As these points have been dealt with in the
Compendium of November 26, 1693, by Commandeur Blom, I would here refer
to that document.I cannot add anything to what is stated there.[72]

The General Paresse is a ceremony which the Mudaliyars, Collectors,
Majoraals, Aratchchies, &c., have to perform twice a year on behalf
of the whole community, appearing together before the Commandeur in
the fort.This is an obligation to which they have been subject from
heathen times, partly to show their submission, partly to report on
the condition of the country, and partly to give them an opportunity
to make any request for the general welfare.As this Paresse tends
to the interest of the Company as Sovereign Power on the one hand
and to that of the inhabitants on the other hand, the custom must be
kept up.When the Commandeur is absent at the time of this Paresse
Your Honours could meet together and receive the chiefs.It is held
once during the northern and once during the southern monsoon, without
being bound to any special day, as circumstances may require it to be
held earlier or later.During my absence the day is to be fixed by the
Dessave, as land regent.Any proposal made by the native chiefs must
be carefully written down by the Secretary, so that it may be possible
to send a report of it to His Excellency the Governor and the Council
if it should be of importance.All transactions must be carefully
noted down and inserted in the journal, so that it may be referred to
whenever necessary.The practice introduced by the Onderkoopman William
de Ridder in Manaar of requiring the Pattangatyns from the opposite
coast to attend not twice but twelve times a year or once a month is
unreasonable, and the people have rightly complained thereof.De Ridder also appointed
a second Cannekappul, which seems quite unnecessary, considering the
small amount of work to be done there for the natives.Jeronimo could
be discharged and Gonsalvo retained, the latter having been specially
sent from Calpentyn by His Excellency Governor Thomas van Rhee and
being the senior in the service.Of how little consequence the work
at Manaar was considered by His Excellency Governor van Mydregt may
be seen from the fact that His Excellency ordered that no Opperhoofd
should be stationed there nor any accounts kept, but that the fort
should be commanded by an Ensign as chief of the military.A second
Cannekappul is therefore superfluous, and the Company could be saved
the extra expense.[73]

I could make reference to a large number of other matters, but it
would be tedious to read and remember them all.I will therefore now
leave in Your Honours' care the government of a Commandement from which
much profit may be derived for the Company, and where the inhabitants,
though deceitful, cunning, and difficult to rule, yet obey through
fear; as they are cowardly, and will do what is right more from fear of
punishment than from love of righteousness.I hope that Your Honours
may have a more peaceful time than I had, for you are well aware
how many difficulties, persecutions, and public slights I have had to
contend with, and how difficult my government was through these causes,
and through continual indisposition, especially of late.However,
Jaffnapatam has been blessed by God during that period, as may be seen
from what has been stated in this Memoir.I hope that Your Honours'
dilligence and experience may supplement the defects in this Memoir,
and, above all, that you will try to live and work together in harmony,
for in that way the Company will be served best.There are people who
will purposely cause dissension among the members of the Council,
with a view to further their own ends or that of some other party,
much to the injury of the person who permits them to do so.[74]

The Political Council consists at present of the following members:--


Ryklof de Bitter, Dessave, Opperkoopman.Abraham M. Biermans, Administrateur.Pieter Boscho, Onderkoopman, Store- and Thombo-keeper.Johannes van Groenevelde, Fiscaal.Pieter Bout, Cashier and Secretary.With a view to enable His Excellency the Governor and the Council to
alter or amplify this Memoir in compliance with the orders from Their
Excellencies at Batavia, cited at the commencement of this document,
I have purposely written on half of the pages only, so that final
instructions might be added, as mine are only provisional.In case
Your Honours should require any of the documents cited which are
not kept here at the Secretariate, they may be applied for from His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.Wishing Your
Honours God's blessing, and all prosperity in the administration of
this extensive Commandement,


I remain, Sirs,
Yours faithfully,
H. ZWAARDECROON.Jaffnapatam, January 1, 1697.A.--The above Instructions were ready for Your Honours when, on
January 31 last, the yacht "Bekenstyn" brought a letter from Colombo
dated January 18, in which we were informed of the arrival of our new
Governor, His Excellency Gerrit de Heere.By the same vessel an extract
was sent from a letter of the Supreme Government of India of October
19 last, in which my transfer to Mallabaar has been ordered.But,
much as I had wished to serve the Company on that coast, I could
not at once obey the order owing to a serious illness accompanied
by a fit, with which it pleased the Lord to afflict me on January
18.Although not yet quite recovered, I have preferred to undertake
the voyage to Mallabaar without putting it off for another six months,
trusting that God will help me duly to serve my superiors, although
the latter course seemed more advisable on account of my state of
health.As some matters have occurred and some questions have arisen
since the writing of my Memoir, I have to add here a few explanations.B.--Together with the above-mentioned letter from Colombo, of January
18, we also received a document signed by both Their Excellencies
Governors Thomas van Rhee and Gerrit de Heere, by which all trade
in Ceylon except that of cinnamon is made open and free to every
one.Since no extract from the letter from Batavia with regard to this
matter was enclosed, I have been in doubt as to how far the permission
spoken of in that document was to be extended.As I am setting down
here my doubt on this point, His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo will, I have no doubt, give further information
upon it.I suppose that the trade in elephants is excepted as well
as that in cinnamon, and that it is still prohibited to capture,
transport, or sell these animals otherwise than on behalf of the
Company, either directly or indirectly, as has been the usage so far.C.--I suppose there will be no necessity now to obtain the areca-nuts
as ordered in the Instructions from Colombo of March 23, 1695, but
that these nuts are included among the articles open to free trade,
so that they may be now brought from Jaffnapatam through the Wanni to
Tondy, Madura, and Coromandel, as well as to other places in Ceylon,
provided the payment of the usual Customs duty of the Alphandigo,
[69] which is 7 1/2 per cent.for export, and that it may also be
freely transported through the Passes on the borders of the Wanni, and
that no Customs duty is to be paid except when it is sent by sea.I
understand that the same will be the rule for cotton, pepper, &c.,
brought from the Wanni to be sent by sea.This will greatly increase
the Alphandigo, so that the conditions for the farming of these must
be altered for the future accordingly.If the Customs duty were also
charged at the Passes, the farming out of these would still increase,
but I do not think that it would benefit the Company very much, because
there are many opportunities for smuggling beyond these three Passes,
and the expenditure of keeping guards would be far too great.The
duty being recovered as Alphandigo, there is no chance of smuggling,
as the vessels have to be provided with proper passports.All vessels
from Jaffnapatam are inspected at the Waterfort, Hammenhiel and at
the redoubt Point Pedro.D.--In my opinion the concession of free trade will necessitate the
remission of the duty on the Jaffnapatam native and foreign cloths,
because otherwise Jaffnapatam would be too heavily taxed compared
with other places, as the duty is 20 and 25 per cent.I think both
the cloths made here and those imported from outside ought to be
taxed through the Alphandigo of 7 1/2 per cent.This would still more
increase the duty, and this must be borne in mind when these revenues
are farmed out next December, if His Excellency the Governor and the
Council approve of my advice.is far too
high, and it must be remembered that this was a duty imposed with a
view to prevent the weaving of cloths and to secure the monopoly of
the trade to the Company, and not in order to make a revenue out of
it.This project did not prove a success; but I will not enter into
details about it, as these may be found in the questions submitted
by me to the Council of Ceylon on January 22, 1695, and I have also
mentioned them in this Memoir under the heading of Rents.E.--It seems to me that henceforth the people of Jaffnapatam would,
as a result of this free trade, be no longer bound to deliver to the
Company the usual 24 casks of coconut oil yearly before they are
allowed to export their nuts.This rule was laid down in a letter
from Colombo of October 13, 1696, with a view to prevent Ceylon being
obliged to obtain coconut oil from outside.This duty was imposed
upon Jaffnapatam, because the trees in Galle and Matura had become
unfruitful from the Company's elephants having to be fed with the
leaves.The same explanation was not urged with regard to Negombo,
which is so much nearer to Colombo than Galle, Matura, or Jaffnapatam,
and it is a well-known fact that many of the ships from Jaffnapatam
and other places are sent with coconuts from Negombo to Coromandel
or Tondel, while the nuts from the lands of the owners there are held
back.I expect therefore that the new Governor His Excellency Gerrit
de Heere and the Council of Colombo will give us further instructions
with regard to this matter.More details may be found in this Memoir
under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--A letter was received from Colombo, bearing date March 4 last,
in which was enclosed a form of a passport which appears to have been
introduced there after the opening of the free trade, with orders to
introduce the same here.This has been done already during my presence
here and must be continued.G.--In the letter of the 9th instant we received various and important
instructions which must be carried out.An answer to this letter was
sent by us on the 22nd of the same month.One of these instructions is
to the effect that a new road should be cut for the elephants which are
to be sent from Colombo.Another requires the compilation of various
lists, one of which is to be a list of all lands belonging to the
Company or given away on behalf of it, with a statement showing by
whom, to whom, when, and why they were granted.I do not think this
order refers to Jaffnapatam, because all fields were sold during the
time of Commandeur Vosch and others.Only a few small pieces of land
were discovered during the compilation of the new Land Thombo, which
some of the natives had been cultivating.A few wild palmyra trees
have been found in the Province of Patchelepalle, but these and the
lands have been entered in the new Thombo.We cannot therefore very
well furnish such a list of lands as regards Jaffnapatam, because
the Company does not possess any, but if desired a copy of the new
Land Thombo (which will consist of several reams of imperial paper)
could be sent.I do not, however, think this is meant, since there is
not a single piece of land in Jaffnapatam for which no taxes are paid,
and it is for the purpose of finding this out that the new Thombo is
being compiled.H.--The account between the Moorish elephant purchasers and the
Company through the Brahmin Timmerza as its agent, about which so
much has been written, was settled on August 31 last, and so also
was the account of the said Timmerza himself and the Company.A
difficulty arises now as to how the business with these people is
to be transacted; because three of the principal merchants from
Galconda arrived here the other day with three cheques to the amount
of 7,145 Pagodas in the name of the said Timmerza.According to the
orders by His Excellency Thomas van Rhee the latter is no longer to
be employed as the Company's agent, so there is some irregularity
in the issue of these cheques and this order, in which it is stated
that the cheques must bear the names of the purchasers themselves,
while on the other hand the purchasers made a special request that
the amount due to them might be paid to their attorneys in cash or
elephants through the said Timmerza.However this may be, I do not
wish to enter into details, as these matters, like many others, had
been arranged by His Excellency the Governor and the Council without
my knowledge or advice.Your Honours must await an answer from His
Excellency the Governor Gerrit de Heere and the Council of Colombo,
and follow the instructions they will send with regard to the said
cheques; and the same course may be followed as regards the cheques
of two other merchants who may arrive here just about the time of my
departure.I cannot specify the amount here, as I did not see these
people for want of time.The merchants of Golconda have also requested
that, as they have no broker to deal with, they may be allowed an
advance by the Company in case they run short of cash, which request
has been communicated in our letter to Colombo of the 4th instant.I.--As we had only provision of rice for this Commandement for
about nine months, application has been made to Negapatam for 20,000
paras of rice, but a vessel has since arrived at Kayts from Bengal,
belonging to the Nabob of Kateck, by name Kaimgaarehen, and loaded as
I am informed with very good rice.If this be so, the grain might be
purchased on behalf of the Company, and in that case the order for
nely from Negapatam could be countermanded.It must be remembered,
however, that the rice from Bengal cannot be stored away, but must
be consumed as soon as possible, which is not the case with that of
Negapatam.The people from Bengal must be well treated and assisted
wherever possible without prejudice to the Company; so that they
may be encouraged to come here more often and thus help us to make
provision for the need of grain, which is always a matter of great
concern here.I have already treated of the Moorish trade and also
of the trade in grain between Trincomalee and Batticaloa, and will
only add here that since the arrival of the said vessel the price
has been reduced from 6 to 5 and 4 fannums the para.K.--On my return from Colombo last year the bargemen of the Company's
pontons submitted a petition in which they complained that they had
been obliged to make good the value of all the rice that had been lost
above 1 per cent.from the cargoes that had been transported from
Kayts to the Company's stores.They complained that the measuring
had not been done fairly, and that a great deal had been blown away
by the strong south-west winds; also that there had been much dust in
the nely, and that besides this it was impossible for them to prevent
the native crew who had been assigned to them from stealing the grain
both by day and night, especially since rice had become so expensive
on account of the scarcity.I appointed a Committee to investigate
this matter, but as it has been postponed through my illness, Your
Honours must now take the matter in hand and have it decided by
the Council.In future such matters must always be brought before
the Council, as no one has the right to condemn others on his own
authority.The excuse of the said bargemen does not seem to carry
much weight, but they are people who have served the Company for 30
or 40 years and have never been known to commit fraud.It must also
be made a practice in future that these people are held responsible
for their cargo only till they reach the harbour where it is unloaded,
as they can only guard it on board of their vessels.L.--I have spoken before of the suspicion I had with regard to the
changing of golden Pagodas, and with a view to have more security in
future I have ordered the cashier Bout to accept no Pagodas except
directly from the Accountant at Negapatam, who is responsible for the
value of the Pagodas.He must send them to the cashier in packets of
100 at a time, which must be sealed.M.--The administration of the entire Commandement having been left by
me to the Opperkoopman and Dessave Mr.Ryklof de Bitter and the other
members of the Council, this does not agree with the orders from the
Supreme Government of India contained in their letter of October 19
last year, but since the Dessave de Bitter has since been appointed as
the chief of the Committee for the pearl fishery and has left already,
it will be for His Excellency the Governor and the Council to decide
whether the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz is to be entrusted with the
administration, as was done last year.Wishing Your Honours for the second time God's blessing,


I remain,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) H. ZWAARDECROON.On board the yacht "Bekenstyn," in the harbour of
Manaar, March 29, 1697.SHORT NOTES by Gerrit de Heere, Governor of the Island of Ceylon,
    on the chief points raised in these Instructions of Commandeur
    Hendrick Zwaardecroon, for the guidance of the Opperkoopman
    Mr.Ryklof de Bitter, Second in authority and Dessave of the
    Commandement, and the other members of the Political Council of
    Jaffnapatam.Where the notes contradict the Instructions the orders
    conveyed by the former are to be followed.In other respects the
    Instructions must be observed, as approved by Their Excellencies
    the Governor-General and the Council of India.The form of Government, as approved at the time mentioned here, must
be also observed with regard to the Dessave and Secunde, Mr.Ryklof
de Bitter, as has been confirmed by the Honourable the Government of
Batavia in their special letter of October 19 last.What is stated here is reasonable and in compliance with the
Instructions, but with regard to the recommendation to send to
Mr.Zwaardecroon by Manaar and Tutucorin advices and communications
of all that transpires in this Commandement, I think it would be
sufficient, as Your Honours have also to give an account to us, and
this would involve too much writing, to communicate occasionally
and in general terms what is going on, and to send him a copy of
the Compendium which is yearly compiled for His Excellency the
Governor.de Bitter and the other members of
Council to do.The Wanni, the largest territory here, has been divided by the
Company into several Provinces, which have been given in usufruct to
some Majoraals, who bear the title of Wannias, on the condition that
they should yearly deliver to the Company 42 1/2 alias (elephants).The
distribution of these tributes is as follows:--


                                                        Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,
    for the Provinces of--

    Don Amblewannar, for the Province of--
        Carnamelpattoe                                            4

    Don Chedoega Welemapane, for the  Province of--
        Tinnemerwaddoe                                            2

    Don Peria Meynaar, for the Province of--
        Moeliawalle                                               3 1/2
                                                                 ======
                                     Total                       42 1/2


The accumulated arrears from the years 1680 to 1694, of which they
were discharged, amounted to 333 1/2 elephants.From that time up to
the present day the arrears have again accumulated to 86 3/4 alias,
namely:--


                                                   Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane                        57 1/2
        Don Diogo Poevenelle Mapane                   23
        Peria Meynaar Oediaar                          4 3/4
        Chedoega Welemapane                            1 1/2
                                                      ======
                     Total                            86 3/4


The result proves that all the honour and favours shown to these people
do not induce them to pay up their tribute; but on the contrary,
as has been shown in the annexed Memoir, they allow them to go on
increasing.This is the reason I would not suffer the indignity of
requesting payment from them, but told them seriously that this would
be superfluous in the case of men of their eminence; which they,
however, entirely ignored.I then exhorted them in the most serious
terms to pay up their dues, saying that I would personally come within
a year to see whether they had done so.As this was also disregarded,
I dismissed them.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,
who owed 57 1/2 alias, made the excuse that these arrears were caused
by the bad terms on which they were with each other, and asked that
I would dissociate them, so that each could pay his own tribute.I
agreed that they should arrange with the Dessave about the different
lands, writing down on ola the arrangements made, and submitting them
to me for approval; but as I have heard no more about the matter up
to the present day, I fear that they only raised these difficulties
to make believe that they were unable to pay, and to try to get the
Company again to discharge them from the delivery of their tribute
of 21 elephants for next year.It would perhaps be better to do this
than to be continually fooled by these people.But you have all
seen how tremblingly they appeared before me (no doubt owing to a
bad conscience), and how they followed the palanquin of the Dessave
like boys, all in order to obtain more favourable conditions; but I
see no reason why they should not pay, and think they must be urged
to do so.They have promised however to pay up their arrears as soon
as possible, so that we will have to wait and see; while Don Diogo
Poevenelle Mapane also has to deliver his 23 alias.In compliance with
the orders from Colombo of May 11, 1696, Don Philip Nellamapane will be
allowed to sell one elephant yearly to the Moors, on the understanding
that he had delivered his tribute, and not otherwise; while the sale
must be in agreement with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia,
contained in their letter of November 13, 1683.The other Provinces,
Carnamelpattoe, Tinnemerwaddoe, and Moeliawalle are doing fairly well,
and the tribute for these has been paid; although it is rather small
and consists only of 9 1/2 alias (elephants), which the Wannias there,
however, deliver regularly, or at least do not take very long in
doing so.Perhaps they could furnish more elephants in lieu of the
tithes of the harvest, and it would not matter if the whole of it
were paid in this way, because this amount could be made up for by
supplies from the lands of Colombo, Galle, and Matara, or a larger
quantity could be ordered overland.That the Master of the Hunt, Don Gasper Nitchenchen Aderayen, should,
as if he were a sovereign, have put to death a Lascoreen and a hunter
under the old Don Gaspar on his own responsibility, is a matter which
will result in very bad consequences; but I have heard rumours to
the effect that it was not his work, but his father's (Don Philip
Nellamapane).With regard to these people Your Honours must observe
the Instructions of Mr.Zwaardecroon, and their further actions must be
watched; because of their conspiracies with the Veddas, in one of which
the brother of Cottapulle Odiaar is said to have been killed.Time
does not permit it, otherwise I would myself hold an inquiry.Mantotte, Moesely, and Pirringaly, which Provinces are ruled by
officers paid by the Company, seem to be doing well; because the
Company received from there a large number of elephants, besides the
tithes of the harvest, which are otherwise drawn by the Wannias.The
two Wannias, Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar, complain that
they do not receive the tribute of two elephants due to them from the
inhabitants of Pirringaly, but I do not find in the decree published
by Commandeur Blom on June 11, 1693, in favour of the inhabitants,
any statement that they owe such tribute for liberation from the rule
of the Wannias, but only that they (these Wannias) will be allowed
to capture elephants.These Wannias, however, sent me a dirty little
document, bearing date May 12, 1694, in which it is stated that the
hunters of Pirringaly had delivered at Manaar for Pannengamo in the
year 1693 two alias, each 4-3/8 cubits high.If more evidence could be
found, it might be proved that such payment of 2 alias yearly really
had to be made, and it would be well for Your Honours to investigate
this matter, because it is very necessary to protect and assist the
hunters as much as possible, as a reward for their diligence in the
capture of elephants.Payment must be made to them in compliance with
the orders of His Excellency van Mydregt.Ponneryn, the third Province from which elephants should
be obtained, and which, like Illepoecarwe, Polweraincattoe, and
Mantotte, was ruled formerly by an Adigar or Lieutenant-Dessave,
was doing fairly well; because the Company received yearly on an
average no less than 25 alias, besides the tithes of the harvest,
until in 1690 the mode of government was changed, and the revenue of
Ponneryn was granted by public decree to the young Don Gaspar by the
Lord Commissioner van Mydregt, while those of the other two Provinces
were granted to the old Don Gaspar, on condition that the young Don
Gaspar would capture and deliver to the Company all elephants which
could be obtained in the said Provinces, while the inhabitants of
Ponneryn would be obliged to obey the Master of the Hunt as far as
their services should be required by the Company and as they had been
accustomed to render.This new arrangement did not prove a success;
because, during seven years, he only delivered 44 elephants, although
in the annexed Memoir it is stated that he delivered 74.Of these 44
animals, 7 were tuskers and 37 alias, viz.:--


                                    Elephants.For 1690                4
                    1691-92             6
                    1692-93             5
                    1693-94            16
                    1694-95            13
                                      ====
                             Total     44


During the last two years he did not deliver a single animal,
so that the Company lost on account of this Master of the Hunt,
131 elephants.He only appropriated the tithes of the harvest, and
did not care in the least about the hunt, so that the Company is even
prevented from obtaining what it would have received by the old method;
and, I must say, I do not understand how these privileges have been
granted so long where they are so clearly against the interest of the
Company, besides being the source of unlawful usurpation practised
over the inhabitants, which is directly against the said deeds of
gift.The elephant hunters have repeatedly applied to be relieved of
their authority and to be allowed to serve again under the Company.For
these reasons, as Your Honour is aware, I have considered it necessary
for the service of the Company to provisionally appoint the sergeant
Albert Hendriksz, who, through his long residence in these Provinces,
has gained a great deal of experience, Adigar over Ponneryn; which
was done at the request of the elephant hunters.He will continue the
capture of elephants with the hunters without regard to the Master of
the Hunt, and Your Honour must give him all the assistance required,
because the hunt has been greatly neglected.Your Honour may allow
both the Don Gaspars to draw the tithes of the harvest until our
authorities at Batavia will have disposed of this matter.The trade in elephants is undoubtedly the most important, as
the rest does not amount to much more than Rds.7,000 to 9,000 a
year.During the year 1695-1696 the whole of the sale amounted to
Fl.33,261.5, including a profit of Fl.We find it stated
in the annexed Memoir that the merchants spoilt their own market by
bidding against each other at the public auctions, but whether this
was really the case we will not discuss here.I positively disapprove
of the complicated and impractical way in which this trade has been
carried on for some years, and which was opposed to the interests
of the Company.I therefore considered it necessary to institute
the public auctions, by which, compared with the former method, the
Company has already gained a considerable amount; which is, however,
no more than what it was entitled to, without it being of the least
prejudice to the trade.I will not enlarge on this subject further,
as all particulars relating to it and everything connected with it may
be found in our considerations and speculations and in the decisions
arrived at in accordance therewith, which are contained in the daily
resolutions from July 24 to August 20 inclusive, a copy of which was
left with Your Honours, and to which I refer you.As to the changed
methods adopted this year, these are not to be altered by any one
but Their Excellencies at Batavia, whose orders I will be obliged
and pleased to receive.As a number of elephants was sold last year
for the sum of Rds.53,357, it was a pity that they could not all
be transported at once, without a number of 126 being left behind on
account of the northern winds.We have therefore started the sale a
little earlier this year, and kept the vessels in readiness, so that
all the animals may be easily transported during August next.On the
20th of this month all purchasers were, to their great satisfaction,
ready to depart, and requested and obtained leave to do so.This year
the Company sold at four different auctions the number of 86 elephants
for the sum of Rds.36,950, 16 animals being left unsold for want of
cash among the purchasers, who are ready to depart with about 200
animals which they are at present engaged in putting on board.The
practice of the early preparation of vessels and the holding of
public auctions must be always observed, because it is a great loss
to the merchants to have to stay over for a whole year, while the
Company also suffers thereby, because in the meantime the animals
do not change masters.It is due to this reason and to the want of
ready cash that this year 16 animals were left unsold.In future it
must be a regular practice in Ceylon to have all the elephants that
are to be sold brought to these Provinces before July 1, so that all
preparations may be made to hold the auctions about the middle of July,
or, if the merchants do not arrive so soon, on August 1.Meanwhile
all the required vessels must be got ready, so that no animals need be
left behind on account of contrary winds.As we have now cut a road,
by which the elephants may be led from Colombo, Galle, and Matura,
as was done successfully one or two months ago, when in two trips
from Matura, Galle, Colombo, Negombo, and Putulang were brought here
with great convenience the large number of 63 elephants, the former
plan of transporting the animals in native vessels from Galle and
Colombo can be dropped now, a few experiments having been made and
proving apparently unsuccessful.It must be seen that at least 12 or
15 elephants are trained for the hunt, as a considerable number is
always required, especially if the animals from Putulang have to be
fetched by land.For this reason I have ordered that two out of the 16
animals that were left from the sale and who have some slight defects,
but which do not unfit them for this work, should be trained, viz.,
No 22, 5 3/8 cubits high, and No.72, 5 1/2 cubits high, which may
be employed to drive the other animals.Meanwhile the Dessave must
see that the two animals which, as he is aware, were lent to Don
Diogo, are returned to the Company.These animals were not counted
among those belonging to the Company, which was very careless.As is
known to Your Honours, we have abolished the practice of branding the
animals twice with the mark circled V, as was done formerly, once when
they were sent to these Provinces and again when they were sold, and
consider it better to mark them only once with a number, beginning
with No.1, 2, 3, &c., up to No.Ten iron brand numbers have
been made for this purpose.If there are more than 100 animals, they
must begin again with number 1, and as a mark of distinction a cross
must be put after each number, which rule must be observed in future,
especially as the merchants were pleased with it and as it is the best
way of identifying the animals.We trust that with the opening of the
King's harbours the plan of obtaining the areca-nut from the King's
territory by water will be unnecessary, but the plan of obtaining
these nuts by way of the Wanni will be dealt with in the Appendix.The trade with the Moors from Bengal must be protected, and these
people fairly and reasonably dealt with, so that we may secure the
necessary supply of grain and victuals.We do not see any reason
why these and other merchants should not be admitted to the sale of
elephants, as was done this year, when every one was free to purchase
as he pleased.The people of Dalpatterau only spent half of their
cash, because they wished to wait till next year for animals which
should be more to their liking.His Excellency the High Commissioner
informed me that he had invited not only the people from Golconda,
but also those of Tanhouwer, [70] &c., to take part in that trade,
and this may be done, especially now that the prospects seem to all
appearances favourable; while from the districts of Colombo, Galle,
and Matura a sufficient number of elephants may be procured to make
up for the deficiency in Jaffnapatam, if we only know a year before
what number would be required, which must be always inquired into.As the Manaar chanks are not in demand in Bengal, we have kept here a
quantity of 36 1/2 Couren of different kinds, intending to sell in the
usual commercial way to the Bengal merchants here present; but they
did not care to take it, and said plainly that the chanks were not of
the required size or colour; they must therefore be sent to Colombo by
the first opportunity, to be sent on to Bengal next year to be sold at
any price, as this will be better than having them lying here useless.The subject of the inhabitants has been treated of in such a way
that it is unnecessary for me to add anything.With regard to the tithes, I agree with Mr.Zwaardecroon that
the taxes need not be reduced, especially as I never heard that the
inhabitants asked for this to be done.It will be the duty of the
Dessave to see that the tenth of the harvest of the waste lands,
which were granted with exemption of taxes for a certain period, is
brought into the Company's stores after the stated period has expired.Poll tax.--It is necessary that a beginning should be made with
the work of revising the Head Thombo, and that the names of the old
and infirm people and of those that have died should be taken off the
list, while the names of the youths who have reached the required age
are entered.This renovation should take place once in three years,
and the Dessave as Land Regent should sometimes assist in this work.Officie Gelden.--It will be very well if this be divided according
to the number of people in each caste, so that each individual pays
his share, instead of the amount being demanded from each caste as
a whole, because it is apparent that the Majoraals have profited by
the old method.No remarks are at present necessary with regard to the Adigary.The Oely service, imposed upon those castes which are bound to
serve, must be looked after, as this is the only practicable means
of continuing the necessary works.The idea of raising the fine for
non-attendance from 2 stivers, which they willingly pay, to 4 stivers
or one fanam, [71] is not bad, but I found this to be the practise
already for many years, as may be seen from the annexed account of two
parties of men who had been absent, which most likely was overlooked
by mistake.This is yet stronger evidence that the circumstances
of the inhabitants have improved, and I therefore think it would be
well to raise the chicos from 4 stivers to 6 stivers or 1 1/2 fanam,
with a view to finding out whether the men will then be more diligent
in the performance of their duty; because the work must be carried on
by every possible means.Your Honours are again seriously recommended
to see that the sicos or fines specified in the annexed Memoir are
collected without delay, and also the amount still due for 1693,
because such delay cannot but be prejudicial to the Company.The old
and infirm people whose names are not entered in the new Thombo must
still deliver mats, and kernels for coals for the smith's shop.No
objections will be raised to this if they see that we do not slacken
in our supervision.Tax Collectors and Majoraals.--The payment of the taxes does not
seem satisfactory, because only Rds.180 have been paid yet out of
the Rds.2,975.1 due as sicos for the year 1695.It would be well
if these officers could be transferred according to the Instructions
of 1673 and 1675.It used to be the practice to transfer them every
three years; but I think it will be trouble in vain now, because when
an attempt was made to have these offices filled by people of various
castes, it caused such commotion and uproar that it was not considered
advisable to persist in this course except where the interest of the
Company made it strictly necessary.Perhaps a gradual change could
be brought about by filling the places of some of the Bellales when
they die by persons of other castes, which I think could be easily
done.Zwaardecroon seems to think it desirable that
the appointment of new officials for vacancies and the issuing of
the actens should be deferred till his return from Mallabaar or
until another Commandeur should come over, we trust that he does
not mean that these appointments could not be made by the Governor
of the Island or by the person authorized by him to do so.If the
Commandeur were present, such appointment should not be made without
his knowledge, especially after the example of the commotion caused
by the transfer of these officers in this Commandement, but in order
that Your Honours may not be at a loss what to do, it will be better
for you not to wait for the return of Mr.Zwaardecroon from Mallabaar,
nor for the arrival of any other Commandeur, but to refer these and
all other matters concerning this Commandement, which is subordinate
to us, to Colombo to the Governor and Council, so that proper advice
in debita forma may be given.The Lascoreens certainly make better messengers than soldiers.The
Dessave must therefore maintain discipline among them, and take
care that no men bound to perform other duties are entered as
Lascoreens.This they often try to bring about in order to be
excused from labour, and the Company is thus deprived of labourers
and is put to great inconvenience.I noticed this to be the case in
Colombo during the short time I was in Ceylon, when the labour had to
be supplied by the Company's slaves.There seems to be no danger of
another famine for some time, as the crop in Coromandel has turned out
very well.We cannot therefore agree to an increase of pay, although
it is true that the present wages of the men are very low.It must
be remembered, however, that they are also very simple people, who
have but few wants, and are not always employed in the service of
the Company; so that they may easily earn something besides if they
are not too lazy.We will therefore keep their wages for the present
at the rate they have been at for so many years; especially because
it is our endeavour to reduce the heavy expenditure of the Company
by every practicable means.We trust that there was good reason why
the concession made by His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor
of India, Mr.Laurens Pyl, in favour of the Lascoreens has not been
executed, and we consider that on account of the long interval that
has elapsed it is no longer of application.The proposal to transfer
the Lascoreens in this Commandement twice, or at least once a year,
will be a good expedient for the reasons stated.The importation of slaves from the opposite coast seems to be most
profitable to the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam, as no less a number
than 3,584 were brought across in two years' time, for which they
paid 9,856 guilders as duty.It would be better if they imported a
larger quantity of rice or nely, because there is so often a scarcity
of food supplies here.It is also true that the importation of so many
slaves increases the number of people to be fed, and that the Wannias
could make themselves more formidable with the help of these men, so
that there is some reason for the question whether the Company does
not run the risk of being put to inconvenience with regard to this
Commandement.Considering also that the inhabitants have suffered
from chicken-pox since the importation of slaves, which may endanger
whole Provinces, I think it will be well to prevent the importation of
slaves.As to the larger importation on account of the famine on the
opposite coast, where these creatures were to be had for a handful of
rice, this will most likely cease now, after the better harvest.The
danger with regard to the Wannias I do not consider so very great, as
the rule of the Company is such that the inhabitants prefer it to the
extreme hardships they had to undergo under the Wannia chiefs, and they
would kill them if not for fear of the power of the Company.Therefore
I think it unnecessary to have any apprehension on this score.Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting,
not only in Jaffnapatam, but throughout Ceylon all over the Company's
territory, and therefore the officers of the Government must constantly
guard against a monopoly being made of this grain.This opportunity
is taken to recommend the matter to Your Honours as regards this
Commandement.I do not consider any remarks necessary with regard to the
native trade.I agree, however, with the method practised by
Mr.Zwaardecroon in order to prevent the monopoly of grain, viz.,
that all vessels returning with grain, which the owners take to Point
Pedro, Tellemanaar, and Wallewitteture, often under false pretexts,
in order to hide it there, should be ordered to sail to Kayts.This
matter is recommended to Your Honours' attention.With regard to the coconut trees, we find that more difficulties
are raised about the order from Colombo of October 13 last, for the
delivery of 24 casks of coconut oil, than is necessary, considering
the large number of trees found in this country.It seems to me that
this could be easily done; because, according to what is published from
time to time, and from what is stated in the Pass Book, it appears that
during the period of five years 1692 to 1696 inclusive, a number of
5,397,800 of these nuts were exported, besides the quantity smuggled
and the number consumed within this Commandement.Calculating that
one cask, or 400 cans of 10 quarterns, of oil can be easily drawn from
5,700 coconuts (that is to say, in Colombo: in this Commandement 6,670
nuts would be required for the same quantity, and thus, for the whole
supply of 24 casks, 160,080 nuts would be necessary), I must say I do
not understand why this order should be considered so unreasonable,
and why the Company's subjects could not supply this quantity for
good payment.Instead of issuing licenses for the export of the nuts
it will be necessary to prohibit it, because none of either of the
kinds of oil demanded has been delivered.I do not wish to express
my opinion here, but will only state that shortly after my arrival,
I found that the inhabitants on their own account gladly delivered the
oil at the Company's stores at the rate of 3 fanams or Rd.1/4 per
marcal of 36 quarterns, even up to 14 casks, and since then, again,
10 casks have been delivered, and they still continue to do so.They
also delivered 3 amen of margosa oil, while the Political Council
were bold enough to assert in their letter of April 4 last that it
was absolutely impossible to send either of the two kinds of oil,
the excuse being that they had not even sufficient for their own
requirements.How far this statement can be relied upon I will not
discuss here; but I recommend to Your Honours to be more truthful
and energetic in future, and not to trouble us with unnecessary
correspondence, as was done lately; although so long as the Dessave
is present I have better expectations.No remarks are necessary on the subject of the iron and steel
tools, except that there is the more reason why what is recommended
here must be observed; because the free trade with Coromandel and
Palecatte has been opened this year by order of the Honourable the
Supreme Government of India.It is very desirable that the palmyra planks and laths should
be purchased by the Dessave.As reference is made here to the large
demand for Colombo and Negapatam, I cannot refrain from remarking
that the demand from Negapatam has been taken much more notice of
than that from Colombo; because, within a period of four years, no
more than 1,970 planks and 19,652 laths have been sent here, which was
by no means sufficient, and in consequence other and far less durable
wood had to be used.We also had to obtain laths from private persons
at Jaffnapatam at a high rate and of inferior quality.I therefore
specially request that during the next northern monsoon the following
are sent to this Commandement of Colombo, [72] where several necessary
building operations are to be undertaken:--4,000 palmyra planks in
two kinds, viz., 2,000 planks, four out of one tree; 2,000 planks,
three out of one tree; 20,000 palmyra laths.Your Honour must see that
this timber is sent to Colombo by any opportunity that offers itself.It will be necessary to train another able person for the
supervision of the felling of timber, so that we may not be put to
any inconvenience in case of the death of the old sergeant.Such
a person must be well acquainted with the country and the forests,
and the advice here given must be followed.Charcoal, which is burnt from kernels, has been mentioned under
the heading of the Oely service, where it is stated who are bound
to deliver it.These persons must be kept up to the mark, but as
a substitute in times of necessity 12 hoeden [73] of coals were
sent last January as promised to Your Honour.This must, however,
be economically used.As stated here, the bark-lunt is more a matter of convenience
than of importance.It is, however, necessary to continue exacting
this duty, being an old right of the lord of the land; but on the
other hand it must be seen that too much is not extorted.The coral stone is a great convenience, and it would be well
if it could be found in more places in Ceylon, when so many hoekers
would not be required to bring the lime from Tutucorin.The lime found here is also a great convenience and profit,
as that which is required in this Commandement is obtained free of
cost.When no more lime is required for Coromandel, the 8,000 or 9,000
paras from Cangature must be taken to Kayts as soon as possible in
payment of what the lime-burners still owe.If it can be proved that
any amount is still due, they must return it in cash, as proposed
by Commandeur Zwaardecroon, which Your Honour is to see to.But as
another order has come from His Excellency the Governor of Coromandel
for 100 lasts of lime, it will be easier to settle this account.The dye-roots have been so amply treated of here and in such a way
that I recommend to Your Honour to follow the advice given.I would
add some remarks on the subject if want of time did not prevent my
doing so.The farming out of the duties, including those on the import of
foreign cloth of 20 per cent., having increased by Rds.4,056 1/2,
must be continued in the same way.The stamping of native cloth
(included in the lease) must be reduced, from September 1 next, to 20
per cent.The farmers must also be required to pay the monthly term
at the beginning of each month in advance, which must be stipulated
in the lease, so that the Company may not run any risks.There are
prospects of this lease becoming more profitable for the Company in
future, on account of the passage having been opened.With regard to the Trade Accounts, such good advice has been
given here, that I fully approve of it and need not make any further
comments, but only recommend the observance of the rules.The debts due to the Company, amounting to 116,426.11.14 guilders
at the end of February, 1694, were at the departure of Mr.Zwaardecroon
reduced to 16,137.8 guilders.This must no doubt be attributed
to the greater vigilance exercised, in compliance with the orders
from the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by resolution
of 1693.This order still holds good and seems to be still obeyed;
because, since the date of this Memoir, the debt has been reduced to
14,118.11.8 guilders.The account at present is as follows:--


                                                     Guilders.[74]
    The Province of Timmoraatsche                    376.2.8
    The Province of Patchelepalle                    579.10.0
    Tandua Moeti and Nagachitty (weavers)          2,448.13.0
    Manuel of Anecotta                             8,539.6.0
    The Tannecares caste                           1,650.0.0
    Don Philip Nellamapane                           375.0.0
    Ambelewanner                                     150.0.0
                                                  ===========
                                      Total       14,118.11.8


Herein is not included the Fl.167.15 which again has been paid to
the weavers Tandua Moeti and Naga Chitty on account of the Company for
the delivery of Salampoeris, while materials have been issued to them
later on.It is not with my approval that these poor people continue
to be employed in the weaving of cloth, because the Salampoeris which I
have seen is so inferior a quality and uneven that I doubt whether the
Company will make any profit on it; especially if the people should
get into arrears again as usual on account of the thread and cash
issued to them.I have an idea that I read in one of the letters from
Batavia, which, however, is not to be found here at the Secretariate,
that Their Excellencies forbid the making of the gingams spoken of
by Mr.Zwaardecroon, as there was no profit to be made on these,
but I am not quite sure, and will look for the letter in Colombo,
and inform Their Excellencies at Batavia of this matter.Meantime,
Your Honours must continue the old practice as long as it does not
act prejudicially to the Company.At present their debt is 2,448.13
guilders, from which I think it would be best to discharge them,
and no advance should be given to them in future, nor should they be
employed in the weaving of cloth for the Company.I do not think they
need be sent out of the country on account of their idolatry on their
being discharged from their debt; because I am sure that most of the
natives who have been baptized are more heathen than Christian, which
would be proved on proper investigation.Besides, there are still so
many other heathen, as, for instance, the Brahmin Timmerza and his
large number of followers, about whom nothing is said, and who also
openly practise idolatry and greatly exercise their influence to aid
the vagabonds (land-loopers) dependent on him, much to the prejudice of
Christianity.I think, therefore, that it is a matter of indifference
whether these people remain or not, the more so as the inhabitants of
Jaffnapatam are known to be a perverse and stiff-necked generation,
for whom we can only pray that God in His mercy will graciously
enlighten their understanding and bless the means employed for their
instruction to their conversion and knowledge of their salvation.It is to be hoped that the debt of the dyers, amounting to 8,539.6
guilders, may yet be recovered by vigilance according to the
instructions.The debt of the Tannekares, who owe 1,650 guilders for 11
elephants, and the amount of 375 guilders due by Don Gaspar advanced
to him for the purchase of nely, as also the amount of Fl.150 from
the Ambelewanne, must be collected as directed here.With regard to the pay books nothing need be observed here but
that the instructions given in the annexed Memoir be carried out.What is said here with regard to the Secretariate must be observed,
but with regard to the proposed means of lessening the duties of
the Secretary by transferring the duties of the Treasurer to the
Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho (in which work the latter is already
employed), I do not know whether it would be worth while, as it is
best to make as few changes as possible.The instructions with regard
to the passports must be followed pending further orders.I will not comment upon what is stated here with regard to the
Court of Justice, as these things occurred before I took up the reins
of Government, and that was only recently.I have besides no sufficient
knowledge of the subject, while also time does not permit me to peruse
the documents referred to.Zwaardecroon's advice must be followed,
but in case Mr.Bolscho should have to be absent for a short time
(which at present is not necessary, as it seems that the preparation
of the maps and the correction of the Thombo is chiefly left to the
surveyors), I do not think the sittings of the Court need be suspended,
but every effort must be made to do justice as quickly as possible.In
case of illness of some of the members, or when the Lieutenant Claas
Isaacsz has to go to the interior to relieve the Dessave of his duties
there, Lieut.van Loeveningen, and, if necessary, the Secretary of the
Political Council, could be appointed for the time; because the time
of the Dessave will be taken up with the supervision of the usual work
at the Castle.I think that there are several law books in stock in
Colombo, of which some will be sent for the use of the Court of Justice
by the first opportunity; as it appears that different decisions have
been made in similar cases among the natives.Great precaution must
be observed, and the documents occasionally submitted to us.I think
that the number of five Lascoreens and six Caffirs will be sufficient
for the assistance of the Fiscaal.I will not make any remarks here on the subject of religion, but
will refer to my annotations under the heading of Outstanding Debts.I agree with all that has been stated here with regard to the
Seminary and need not add anything further, except that I think this
large school and church require a bell, which may be rung on Sundays
for the services and every day to call the children to school and
to meals.As there are bells in store, the Dessave must be asked to
see that one is put up, either at the entrance of the church on some
steps, or a little more removed from the door, or wherever it may be
considered to be most convenient and useful.All that is said here with regard to the Consistory I can only
confirm.I approve of the advice given to the Dessave to see to the
improvement of the churches and the houses belonging thereto; but I
have heard that the neglect has extended over a long period and the
decay is very serious.It should have been the duty of the Commandeur
to prevent their falling into ruin.The Civil or Landraad ought to hold its sittings as stated in the
Memoir.I am very much surprised to find that this Court is hardly
worthy of the name of Court any more, as not a single sitting has been
held or any case heard since March 21, 1696.It appears that these
sittings were not only neglected during the absence of the Commandeur
in Colombo, but even after his return and since his departure for
Mallabaar, and it seems that they were not even thought of until my
arrival here.This shows fine government indeed, considering also
that the election of the double number of members for this College had
twice taken place, the members nominated and the list sent to Colombo
without a single meeting being held.It seems to me incomprehensible,
and as it is necessary that this Court should meet again once every
week without fail, the Dessave, as chief in this Commandement when the
Commandeur is absent, is entrusted with the duty of seeing that this
order is strictly observed.As Your Honours are aware, I set apart a
meeting place both for this Court as well as the Court of Justice,
namely, the corner house next to the house of the Administrateur
Biermans, consisting of one large and one small room, while a roof has
been built over the steps.This, though not of much pretension, will
quite do, and I consider it unnecessary to build so large a building as
proposed either for this Court or for the Scholarchen.The scholarchial
meetings can be held in the same place as those of the Consistory,
as is done in Colombo and elsewhere, and a large Consistory has been
built already for the new church.As it is not necessary now to put up
a special building for those assemblies, I need not point out here the
errors in the plan proposed, nor need I state how I think such a place
should be arranged.I have also been averse to such a building being
erected so far outside the Castle and in a corner where no one comes
or passes, and I consider it much better if this is done within the
Castle.There is a large square adjoining the church, where a whole
row of buildings might be put up.It is true that no one may erect
new buildings on behalf of the Company without authority and special
orders from Batavia.I have to recommend that this order be strictly
observed.Whether or not the said foul pool should be filled up I
cannot say at present, as it would involve no little labour to do so.I approve of the advice given in the annexed Memoir with regard
to the Orphan Chamber.I agree with this passage concerning the Commissioners of Marriage
Causes, except that some one else must be appointed in the place of
Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz if necessary.Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and Wardens of the Town.As stated here, the deacons have a deficit of Rds.1,145.3.7 over
the last five and half years, caused by the building of an Orphanage
and the maintenance of the children.At present there are 18 orphans,
10 boys and 8 girls, and for such a small number certainly a large
building and great expenditure is unnecessary.As the deficit has been
chiefly caused by the building of the Orphanage, which is paid for
now, and as the Deaconate has invested a large capital, amounting to
Fl.40,800, on interest in the Company, I do not see the necessity of
finding it some other source of income, as it would have to be levied
from the inhabitants or paid by the Company in some way or other.No more sums on interest are to be received in deposit on behalf
of the Company, in compliance with the instructions referred to.What is stated here with regard to the money drafts must be
observed.Golden Pagodas.--I find a notice, bearing date November 18,
1695, giving warning against the introduction of Pagodas into this
country.It does not seem to have had much effect, as there seems
to be a regular conspiracy and monopoly among the chetties and other
rogues.This ought to be stopped, and I have therefore ordered that
none but the Negapatam and Palliacatte Pagodas will be current at 24
fannums or Rds.2, while it will be strictly prohibited to give in
payment or exchange any other Pagodas, whether at the boutiques or
anywhere else, directly or indirectly, on penalty of the punishment
laid down in the statutes.Your Honours must see that this rule
is observed, and care must be taken that no payment is made to the
Company's servants in coin on which they would have to lose.The applications from outstations.--The rules laid down in the
annexed Memoir must be observed.With regard to the Company's sloops and other vessels, directions
are given here as to how they are employed, which directions must be
still observed.Further information or instructions may be obtained
from Colombo.The Fortifications.--I think it would be preferable to leave the
fortifications of the Castle of Jaffnapatam as they are, instead
of raising any points or curtains.But improvements may be made,
such as the alteration of the embrazures, which are at present on the
outside surrounded by coral stone and chunam, and are not effective,
as I noticed that at the firing of the salute on my arrival, wherever
the canons were fired the coral stone had been loosened and in some
places even thrown down.The sentry boxes also on the outer points
of the flank and face had been damaged.These embrazures would be
very dangerous for the sentry in case of an attack, as they would
not stand much firing.I think also that the stone flooring for the
artillery ought to be raised a little, or, in an emergency, boards
could be placed underneath the canon, which would also prevent the
stones being crushed by the wheels.I noticed further that each canon
stands on a separate platform, which is on a level with the floor of
the curtain, so that if the carriage should break when the canon are
fired, the latter would be thrown down, and it would be with great
difficulty only that they could be replaced on their platform.It
would be much safer if the spaces between these platforms were filled
up.The ramparts are all right, but the curtain <DW72>s too much;
this was done most likely with a view of permitting the shooting with
muskets at even a closer range than half-way across the moat.This
deficiency might be rectified by raising the earthen wall about
half a foot.These are the chief deficiencies I noticed, which could
be easily rectified.With regard to the embrazures, I do not know at
present whether it would be safer to follow the plan of the Commandeur
or that of the Constable-Major Toorse.For the present I have ordered
the removal of the stones and their replacement by grass sods, which
can be fixed on the earthen covering of the ramparts.Some of the
soldiers well experienced in this work are employed in doing this,
and I think that it will be far more satisfactory than the former plan,
which was only for show.The sentry boxes had better be built inside,
and the present passage to them from the earthen wall closed up, and
they must be built so that they would not be damaged by the firing of
the canon.The Dessave has been instructed to see that the different
platforms for the artillery are made on one continuous floor, which
can be easily done, as the spaces between them are but very small
and the materials are at hand.I wish the deficiencies outside the fort could be remedied as well
as those within it.The principal defect is that the moat serves as
yet very little as a safeguard, and it seems as if there is no hope
of its being possible to dig it sufficiently deep, considering that
experiments have been made with large numbers of labourers and yet the
work has advanced but little.When His Excellency the Honourable the
Commissioner van Mydregt was in Jaffnapatam in 1690, he had this work
continued for four or five weeks by a large number of people, but he
had to give it up, and left no instructions as far as is known.The
chief difficulty is the very hard and large rocks enclosed in the
coral stone, which cannot be broken by any instrument and have to
be blasted.This could be successfully done in the upper part, but
lower down beneath the water level the gunpowder cannot be made to
take fire.As this is such an important work, I think orders should
be obtained from Batavia to carry on this work during the dry season
when the water is lowest; because at that time also the people are
not engaged in the cultivation of fields, so that a large number
of labourers could be obtained.The blasting of the rocks was not
undertaken at first for fear of damage to the fortifications, but
as the moat has been dug at a distance of 10 roods from the wall,
it may be 6 or 7 roods wide and a space would yet remain of 3 or
4 roods.This, in my opinion, would be the only effectual way of
completing the work, provision being made against the rushing in of the
water, while a sufficient number of tools, such as shovels, spades,
&c., must be kept at hand for the breaking of the coral stones.It
would be well for the maintenance of the proper depth to cover both
the outer and inner walls with coral stone, as otherwise this work
would be perfectly useless.With regard to the high grounds northward and southward of the town,
this is not very considerable, and thus not a source of much danger.I
admit, however, that it would be better if they were somewhat lower,
but the surface is so large that I fear it would involve a great
deal of labour and expenditure.In case this were necessary, it would
be just as important that the whole row of buildings right opposite
the fort in the town should be broken down.I do not see the great
necessity for either, while moreover, the soil consists of sand and
stone, which is not easily dug.With regard to the horse stables and
the carpenters' yard just outside the gate of the Castle, enclosed
by a wall, the river, and the moat of the Castle, which is deepest
in that place (although I did not see much water in it), I think it
would have been better if they had been placed elsewhere; but yet I
do not think they are very dangerous to the fort, especially as that
corner can be protected from the points Hollandia and Gelria; while,
moreover, the roof of the stable and the walls towards the fort could
be broken down on the approach of an enemy; for, surely no one could
come near without being observed.As these buildings have been only
newly erected, they will have to be used, in compliance with the
orders from Batavia.Thus far as to my advice with regard to this fort; but I do not mean to
oppose the proposals of the Commandeur.I will only state here that I
found the moat of unequal breadth, and in some places only half as wide
as it ought to be, of which no mention is made here.In some places
also it is not sufficiently deep to turn the water by banks or keep it
four or five feet high by water-mills.Even if this were so, I do not
think the water could be retained on account of the sandy and stony
soil, especially as there are several low levels near by.Supposing
even that it were possible, the first thing an enemy would do would be
to direct a few shots of the canon towards the sluices, and thus make
them useless.I would therefore recommend that, if possible, the moat
be deepened so far during the south-west monsoon that it would be on a
level with the river, by which four or six feet of water would always
stand in it.With regard to the sowing of thorns, I fear that during
the dry season they would be quite parched and easily take fire.This
proposal shows how little the work at the moat has really advanced,
in fact, when I saw it it was dry and overgrown with grass.So long
as the fort is not surrounded by a moat, I cannot see the necessity
for a drawbridge, but the Honourable the Government of India will
dispose of this matter.Meantime I have had many improvements made,
which I hope will gain the approval of Their Excellencies.The fortress Hammenhiel is very well situated for the protection
of the harbour and the river of Kaits.The sand bank and the wall
damaged by the storm have been repaired.The height of the reservoir
is undoubtedly a mistake, which must be altered.The gate and the part
of the rampart are still covered with the old and decayed beams, and
it would be well if the project of Mr.This is a
very necessary work, which must be hurried on as much as circumstances
permit, and it is recommended to Your Honours' attention, because
the old roof threatens to break down.As I have not seen any of these places, I cannot say whether the
water tanks are required or not.As the work has to wait for Dutch
bricks, it will be some time before it can be commenced, because
there are none in store here.Manaar is a fortress with four entire bastions.I found that the
full garrison, including Europeans and Mixties, [75] consists of 44
men, twelve or fifteen of whom are moreover usually employed in the
advanced guard or elsewhere.I do not therefore see the use of this
fortress, and do not understand why instead of this fortress a redoubt
was not built.Having been built the matter cannot now be altered.It
has been stated that Manaar is an island which protects Jaffnapatam
on the south, but I cannot see how this is so.The deepening of
the moat cannot be carried out so soon, but the elevations may be
removed.Lime I consider can be burnt there in sufficient quantities,
and my verbal orders to the Resident have been to that effect.The
pavement for the canons I found quite completed, but the floors of
the galleries of the dwelling houses not yet.The water reservoir
of brick, which is on a level with the rampart, I have ordered to be
surrounded with a low wall, about 3 or 3 1/2 feet high, with a view
to prevent accidents to the sentinels at night, which are otherwise
likely to occur.The Dessave must see whether this has been done,
as it is not likely that I would go there again, because I intend
returning to Colombo by another route.Great attention should be paid to the provisions and
ammunition.The order of His Excellency van Mydregt was given as a
wise precaution, but has proved impracticable after many years of
experience, as His Excellency himself was also aware, especially
with regard to grain and rice, on account of the variable crops to
which we are subject here.However, the plan must be carried out as
far as possible in this Commandement, with the understanding that
no extraordinary prices are paid for the purchase of rice; while, on
the other hand, care must be taken that the grain does not spoil by
being kept too long; because we do not know of any kind of rice except
that from Coromandel which can be kept even for one year.At present
rice and nely are easily obtained, and therefore I do not consider it
necessary that the people of Jaffnapatam should be obliged to deliver
their rice at half per cent.The ten kegs of meat
and ten kegs of bacon must be sent to Colombo by the first opportunity,
to be disposed of there, if it is not spoilt (which is very much to
be feared).In case it is unfit for use the loss will be charged to
the account of this Commandement, although it has to be borne by the
Company all the same.Greater discrimination should be exercised in
future to prevent such occurrences, and I think it would be well in
emergencies to follow the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen, viz., to
capture 1,000 or 1,200 cattle around the fort and drive them inside it,
while dry burs, &c., may also be collected to feed them.The arrack
must never be accepted until it has been proved to be good.In Batavia
it is tested by burning it in a silver bowl, and the same ought to be
done here, it being tested by two Commissioners and the dispenser.In
future bad arrack will be charged to the account of the person who
accepted it.The acceptance of inferior goods proves great negligence,
to say the least, and Your Honours are recommended to see that these
orders are observed.It is a satisfaction to know that there is a
sufficient stock of ammunition.An attempt must be made to repair
the old muskets, and those which are unfit for use must be sent to
Colombo.The storing away of fuel is a
praiseworthy precaution; but on my arrival I found only very little
kept here, and the space for the greater part empty.The military and the garrison are proportionately as strong here as
in other places, the want of men being a general complaint.However,
in order to meet this defect in some way, 34 of the military men who
came here with me are to remain, and also the three men whom I left
at Manaar and appointed to that station.I therefore do not think it
necessary to employ any more oepasses, [76] especially as we intend to
reduce the number of these people in Colombo to a great extent, so that
if they are really required, which I cannot see yet, some of them might
be sent here.At present we have nothing to fear from the Sinhalese.We
are on good terms with them, and it would be inexcusable to employ
any new men whose maintenance would be a heavy expenditure.Strict
discipline and continual military drill are very important points,
specially recommended to the attention of the Dessave.Public Works.--Care must be taken that no more native artisans
are employed than is necessary, as this means a considerable daily
expenditure.The various recommendations on this subject must be
observed.The four old and decayed Portuguese houses, which I found
to be in a bad condition, must be rebuilt when circumstances permit,
and may then serve as dwellings for the clergy and other qualified
officers, [77] but orders from Batavia must be awaited.Meantime
I authorize Your Honours to have the armoury rebuilt, as this is
indispensable.I agree with the recommendations with regard to the horse stables,
and also think that they could very well be supervised by the Chief,
and that it is undesirable for private overseers to be employed
for this purpose.The stable outside the fort has been brought into
readiness, and it may now be considered for what purpose the stable
in the Castle could be utilized.It is well that the floor of the hospital has been raised,
but the floor of the back gallery is also too low, so that it is
always wet whenever it rains, the water both rising from the ground
and coming down from the roof, which has been built too flat.It is
also necessary that a door be made in the ante-room and the entrance
of the gallery, in order to shut out the cold north winds, which are
very strong here and cause great discomfort to the patients.I also
think that the half walls between the rooms should be raised by a half
stone wall up to the roof, because it is too cold as it is at present
for such people.These and other improvements are also recommended
to the attention of the Dessave.It is always the case with the Company's slaves, to ask for
higher pay as soon as they learn a trade.I cannot countenance this
on my part, because I consider that they already receive the highest
pay allowed for a slave.They deserve no more than others who have
to do the heaviest and dirtiest work.These also if put to the test
would do higher work, as experience has proved.It is true that the
number here is small, but I think the rules should be the same in
all places.As there are, however, some slaves in Colombo also who
receive higher pay, the wages of the man who draws 6 fanams might be
raised to 8, 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 fanams, on the understanding that no
increase will be given hereafter.The emancipation of slaves and the
intermarrying with free people has also been practised and tolerated
in Ceylon, but whatever may be the pretext, I think it is always
to the prejudice of the Company in the case of male slaves.In the
case of women without children the matter is not quite so important,
and I would consent to it in the present case of the woman whom a
native proposes to marry, provided she has no children and is willing
to place a strong and healthy substitute.Until further orders no
more slaves are to be emancipated or allowed to intermarry with
free people.Those who are no longer able to work must be excused,
but those who have been receiving higher pay because they know some
trade will, in that case, receive no more than ordinary slaves.It
is not wise to emancipate slaves because they are old, as it might
have undesirable consequences, while also they might in that case
very soon have to be maintained by the Deaconate.It is in compliance with our orders that close regard should
be paid to all that passes at Manaar.This has been confirmed again
by our letter of June 1, especially with a view to collect the duty
from the vessels carrying cloth, areca-nut, &c., as was always done
by the Portuguese, and formerly also by the Company during the time
of the free trade.Further orders with regard to this matter must be
awaited from Batavia.Meantime our provisional orders must be observed,
and in case these are approved, it will have to be considered whether
it would not be better to lease the Customs duty.Personally I think
that this would be decidedly more profitable to the Company.With regard to the ill-fated elephants, I have to seriously
recommend better supervision.It is unaccountable how so many of
these animals should die in the stables.Out of three or four animals
sent to Jaffnapatam in 1685, and once even out of ten animals sent,
only one reached the Castle alive.If such be the case, what use is
it to the Company for efforts to be made for the delivery of a large
number of elephants?Moreover, experience proves that this need not
be looked upon as inevitable, because out of more than 100 elephants
kept in the lands of Matura hardly two or three died in a whole year,
while two parties of 63 animals each had been transported for more than
120 miles by land and reached their destination quite fresh and well,
although there were among these six old and decrepit and thirteen baby
elephants, some only 3 cubits high and rather delicate.It is true, as
has been said, that the former animals had been captured with nooses,
which would tire and harm them more than if they were caught in kraals,
but even then they make every effort to regain their liberty, and,
moreover, the kraals were in use here also formerly, and even then
a large number of the animals died.These are only vain excuses,
for I have been assured by the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and others
who have often assisted in the capture of elephants, both with nooses
and in kraals, that these animals (which are very delicate and must
be carefully tended, as they cannot be without food for 24 hours)
were absolutely neglected both in the stables at Manaar and on the
way.An animal of 5 or 6 cubits high is fed and attended there by only
one cooly, while each animal requires at least three coolies.They
are only fed on grass, if it is to be had, and at most 10, 12, or
15 olas or coconut leaves, whereas they require at least 50 or 60,
and it is very likely that those that are being transported get still
less, while the journey itself also does them a great deal of harm.How
little regard is paid to these matters I have seen myself in the lands
of Mantotte and elsewhere, and the Chief of Manaar, Willem de Ridder,
when questioned about it, had to admit that none of the keepers or
those who transported the animals, who are usually intemperate and
inexperienced toepas soldiers or Lascoreens, had ever been questioned
or even suspected in this matter.This is neglect of the Company's
interests, and in future only trustworthy persons should be employed,
and fines or corporal punishment ordered in case of failure, as the
death of such a large number of elephants causes considerable loss
to the Company.I think it would be best if the Chief of Manaar were
held mostly responsible for the supervision and after him the Adigar of
Mantotte.They must see that the animals are fed properly when kept in
the stalls during the rainy season; and these animals must always have
more than they eat, as they tread upon and waste part of it.During
the dry season the animals must be distributed over the different
villages in the Island, some also being sent to Carsel.Care must be
taken that besides the cornak [78] there are employed three parrias
[79] for each animal to provide its food, instead of one only as at
present, and besides the Chief and the Adigar a trustworthy man should
be appointed, either a Dutch sergeant or corporal or a reliable native,
to supervise the stalls.His duty will be to improve the stables,
and see that they are kept clean, and that the animals are properly
fed.The tank of Manaar, which is shallow and often polluted by
buffaloes, must be cleaned, deepened, and surrounded with a fence,
and in future only used for the elephants.The Adigar must supervise
the transport of the elephants from Mantotte and Manaar to the Castle,
and he must be given for his assistance all such men as he applies
for.At the boundary of the district of Mantotte he must give over his
charge to the Adigar of Pringaly, and the latter transporting them to
the boundary of Ponneryn must give them over to the Adigar of Ponneryn,
and he again at the Passes to the Ensign there, who will transport them
to the Castle.Experience will prove that in this way nearly all the
animals will arrive in good condition.The Dessave de Bitter is to see
that these orders are carried out, and he may suggest any improvements
he could think of, which will receive our consideration.This is
all I have to say on the subject.It seems that the Castle, &c.,
are mostly kept up on account of the elephants, and therefore the
sale of these animals must counterbalance the expenditure.The cultivation of dye-roots is dealt with under the heading of
the Moorish Trade.I approve the orders from Colombo of May 17, 1695, with regard
to the proposal by Perie Tamby, for I think that he would have looked
for pearl oysters more than for chanks.With regard to the pearl fishery, some changes will have to be
made.The orders will be sent in time from Colombo before the next
fishery.In my Memoir, left at Colombo, I have ordered with regard
to the proposal of the Committee that four buoys should be made as
beacons for the vessels, each having a chain of 12 fathoms long, with
the necessary adaptations in the links for turning.With regard to the
question as to the prohibition of the export of coconuts on account
of the large number of people that will collect there, I cannot see
that it would be necessary.When the time arrives, and it is sure
that a fishery will be held, Your Honours may consider the question
once more, and if you think it to be so, the issue of passports may
be discontinued for the time.Most likely a fishery will be held
in the beginning of next year, upon which we hope God will give His
blessing, the Company having made a profit of Fl.77,435.12 1/2 last
time, when only three-fourths of the work could be done on account
of the early south-west monsoon.All particulars having been stated here with regard to the
inhabited islets, I do not consider it necessary to make any remarks
about them.Horse breeding surely promises good results as stated in the
annexed Memoir.I visited the islands De Twee Gebroeders, and saw
about 200 foals of one, two, and three years old.I had some caught
with nooses, and they proved to be of good build and of fairly
good race.On the island of Delft there are no less than 400 or 500
foals.Many of those on the islands De Twee Gebroeders will soon be
large enough to be captured and trained, when 15 animals, or three
teams, must be sent to Colombo to serve for the carriages with four
horses in which it is customary to receive the Kandyan ambassadors
and courtiers.They must be good animals, and as much as possible
alike in colour.At present we have only ten of these horses, many
of which are too old and others very unruly, so that they are almost
useless.Besides these, 15 riding horses are required for the service
of the Company in Colombo and Galle, as not a single good saddle
horse is to be found in either of these Commandements.Besides these,
25 or 30 horses must be sent for sale to private persons by public
auction, which I trust will fetch a good deal more than Rds.25 or 35,
as they do in Coromandel.The latter prices are the very lowest at
which the animals are to be sold, and none must be sold in private,
but always by public auction.This, I am sure, will be decidedly in the
interest of the Company and the fairest way of dealing.I would further
recommend that, as soon as possible, a stable should be built on the
islands De Twee Gebroeders like that in Delft, or a little smaller,
where the animals could be kept when captured until they are a little
tamed, as they remain very wild for about two months.Next to this
stable a room or small house should be built for the Netherlander to
whom the supervision is entrusted.At present this person, who is
moreover married, lives in a kind of Hottentot's lodging, which is
very unseemly.The Dessave must see that the inhabitants of the island
Delft are forbidden to cultivate cotton, and that the cotton trees now
found there are destroyed; because the number of horses is increasing
rapidly.The Dessave noticed only lately that large tracts of land of
two, three, and more miles are thus cultivated, in direct opposition
to the Company's orders.It seems they are not satisfied to be allowed
to increase the number of their cattle by thousands, all of which have
to derive their food from the island as well as the Company's horses,
but they must also now cultivate cotton, which cannot be tolerated
and must be strictly prohibited.Once the horses perished for want of
water; on one occasion they were shot on account of crooked legs; and
it would be gross carelessness if now they had to perish by starvation.The Passes of Colomboture, Catsjay, Ponneryn, Pyl, Elephant, and
Beschutter; Point Pedro; the Water fortress, Kayts or Hammenhiel;
Aripo; Elipoecareve; and Palwerain-cattoe.No particular remarks
are necessary with regard to these Passes and stations, except that
I would recommend the Dessave, when he has an opportunity to visit
the redoubts Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter with an expert, to see in
what way they could be best connected.I think that out of all the
different proposals that of a strong and high wall would deserve
preference, if it be possible to collect the required materials,
as it would have to be two miles long.As to the other proposals,
such as that of making a fence of palmyra trees or thorns, or to
dig a moat, I think it would be labour in vain; but whatever is
done must be carried out without expense or trouble to the Company,
in compliance with the orders from the Supreme Government of India.The instructions with regard to the water tanks must be carried
out as far as possible.I agree with what is said here with regard to the public roads.That the elephant stalls and the churches should have been allowed
to fall into decay speaks badly for the way in which those concerned
have performed their duty; and it is a cause of dissatisfaction.The
orders for the stalls in Manaar must also be applied for here,
and repairs carried out as soon as possible.I have been informed
that there are many elephants scattered here and there far from each
other, while only one Vidana acts as chief overseer, so that he cannot
possibly attend to his duty properly.It has been observed that the
elephants should have more parias or men who provide their food.These
and other orders with regard to the animals should be carried out.No remarks are required with regard to this subject of thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Carret, and elephants' tusks.The General Paresse [80] has been held upon my orders on the last
of July.Three requests were made, two of which were so frivolous and
unimportant that I need not mention them here.The
third and more important one was that the duty on native cloth,
which at present is 25 per cent., might be reduced.It was agreed
that from the 31st December it would be only 20 per cent.I was in a
position to settle this matter at once, because orders had been already
received from Batavia that they could be reduced to 20 per cent.,
but no more.As shown in the annexed Memoir, the inhabitants are not
so badly off as they try to make us believe.The further instructions
in the annexed Memoir must be observed; and although I have verbally
ordered the Onderkoopman De Bitter to have the Pattangatyns appear
only twice instead of twelve times a year, as being an unbearable
inconvenience, the Dessave must see that this order is obeyed.He must
also make inquiries whether the work could be done by one Cannekappul,
and, if so, Jeronimus must be discharged.Conclusion.--The advice in this conclusion may be useful to Your
Honours.I confirm the list of members of the Political Council,
to whom the rule of this Commandement in the interest of the Company
is seriously recommended.Reports of all transactions must be sent
to Colombo.A.--No remarks are necessary in regard to the introduction.B.--In elucidation of the document sent by us with regard to the
opening of the harbours of the Kandyan King, as to how far the
instructions extend and how they are to be applied within the Company's
jurisdiction, nothing need be said here, as this will be sufficiently
clear from our successive letters from Colombo.We would only state
that it would seem as if Mr.Zwaardecroon had forgotten that the
prohibition against the clandestine export of cinnamon applies also
to the export of elephants, and that these may not be sold either
directly or indirectly by any one but the Company.C.--It is not apparent that our people would be allowed to
purchase areca-nut in Trincomalee on account of the opening of
the harbours.Zwaardecroon's plan has been submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia, who replied in their letters of December 12,
1695, and July 3, 1696, that some success might be obtained by getting
the nuts through the Wanny from the King's territory.An experiment
might be made (provided Their Excellencies approve) charging Rds.1/3
per ammunam, as is done in Colombo, Galle, Matura, &c. This toll could
be farmed out, and the farmers authorized to collect the duty at the
passes, no further duties being imposed whether the nuts are exported
or not.If the duty were levied only on the nuts that are exported,
the inhabitants who now buy them from the Company at Rds.6 per ammunam
would no longer do so, and this profit would be lost.Whether the
duty ought to be higher than Rds.The same
rule must be applied to pepper, cotton, &c., imported at the passes,
7 1/2 per cent.[81] This being paid,
the articles may be sold here, exported, or anything done as the
inhabitants please, without further liability to duty.D.--In the proclamation referred to here, in which free trade is
permitted at all harbours in Ceylon in the Company's territory,
it is clearly stated that the harbours may be freely entered with
merchandise, provided the customary duties are paid, and that only
the subjects of the Kandyan King are exempted from the payment of
these.It does not seem to me that this rule is in agreement with
the supposition that because of this free trade the duty on foreign
and native cloth would be abolished.Zwaardecroon had made
inquiries he would have been informed that, as far as the import of
foreign cloth is concerned, the duty is the same as that in Colombo and
Galle.The proposed change would apparently bring about an increase of
the alphandigo, but where then would be found the Rds.7,1 0 as duty
on the native and foreign cloths?I cannot see on what basis this
proposal is founded, and I therefore think that the Customs duty of
20 per cent.on the imported foreign cloths and the 20 per cent.for
the stamping of native cloths must be continued when, on the 31st
December next, the lease for the duty of 25 per cent.expires, the
more so as it has been pointed out in this Memoir wherever possible
that the inhabitants are increasing in prosperity.This agrees with
what was discussed at the general Paresse.With regard to the Moorish
merchants from Bengal, there would be no objection to the duty on the
cloths imported by them being fixed at 7 1/2 per cent., because they
have to make a much longer voyage than the merchants from Coromandel
and other places on the opposite coast; while we have to humour them
in order to induce them to provide us with rice.Moreover the Bengal
cloths are not very much in demand, and these people usually ask to
be paid in elephants, which do not cost the Company very much, rather
than in cash, as has been done again by the owner of the ship that is
here at present on behalf of the Bengal Nabob Caungaarekan.He also
complained of the duty of 20 per cent.and said he would pay no more
than the Company pays in Bengal.He said his master the Nabob would
be very angry, &c. We therefore considered whether the duty could not
be reduced to 7 1/2 per cent., as may be seen in the resolutions of
June 4 last.On December 12, 1695, a letter was received from Batavia
in answer to the difficulties raised by Mr.Zwaardecroon with regard
to these impositions, in which it is said that the Customs duty for
Bengal from the date of the license for free trade should be regulated
as it had been in olden times, with authority to remove difficulties
in their way and to give them redress where necessary.I found that
the duty paid by them formerly on these cloths was 7 1/2 per cent.,
both in Galle and here, and I therefore authorize Your Honours to
levy from them only that amount.This must be kept in mind at the
farming out of these revenues at the end of the year, in order to
prevent difficulties with the farmer, as happened only lately.I
trust, however, that the farming out will not yield less than other
years.Meantime, and before any other vessels from Bengal arrive, the
approbation of Their Excellencies at Batavia must be obtained with
regard to this matter, so that alterations may be made according to
their directions without any difficulty.E.--I must confess that I do not understand how the subject of
free trade can be brought forward again as being opposed to the
Company's interests, as is done again with regard to the 24 casks
of coconut oil which the inhabitants have to deliver to the Company,
which are properly paid for and are not required for the purpose of
sale but for the use of the Company's servants, or how any one dares
to maintain that the lawful sovereign who extends his graciousness
and favours over his subjects and neighbours would be tied down and
prejudiced by such rules.It is true that the coconut trees in Matura
are required for the elephants, but in Galle and Colombo it is not so;
but the largest number of trees there is utilized for the drawing of
surie [82] for arrack, &c. It is true that some nuts are exported,
but only a small quantity, while the purchasers or transporters have
to sell one-third of what they export to the Company at Rds.2 a
thousand, while they must cost them at least Rds.Out of these we
had the oil pressed ourselves, and this went largely to supplement
the requirements for local consumption, which are very large, since
the vessels also have to be supplied, because as a matter of economy
the native harpuis (resin) has been largely used for rubbing over
the ships, so as to save the Dutch resin as much as possible, and
for the manufacture of this native resin a large quantity of oil is
required.Your Honours must therefore continue to have all suitable
casks filled with oil, and send to Colombo all that can be spared
after the required quantity has been sent to Coromandel, Trincomalee,
and Batticaloa, reserving what is necessary for the next pearl fishery
and the use of the Commandement.In order to avoid difficulties, Your
Honours are required to send to Colombo yearly (until we send orders
to the contrary) 12 casks of coconut oil and 2 casks of margosa oil,
which are expected without failure.For the rest we refer to what is
said under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--This form for a passport was sent for no other purpose but that
it should be introduced according to instructions.G.--There is sufficient time yet for the opening of the road from
Putulang to Mantotte.I am well pleased with the work of the Dessave,
and approve of the orders given by him to the Toepas Adigar Rodrigo,
and the various reports submitted by him.In these he states that the
roads are now in good condition, while on June 5, when 34 elephants
arrived from Colombo, on this side of Putulang nothing had been done
yet, and even on July 16 and 17 when His Excellency the Governor
passed part of that road the work had advanced but very little.I
therefore sent on the 14th instant the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, who
had successfully transported the animals from Colombo to Putulang,
and is a man who can be depended upon, with two surveyors to see
that the roads, which were narrow and extraordinary crooked, were
widened to 2 roods and straightened somewhat in the forest, and to
cut roads leading to the water tanks.Sixty Wallias or wood-cutters,
150 coolies, and 25 Lascoreens were sent to complete this work, so
that in future there will be no difficulties of this kind, except
that the dry tanks must be deepened.Isaacsz on this
subject on my return.On account of his shameful neglect and lying
and for other well-known reasons I have dismissed the Adigar Domingo
Rodrigo as unworthy to serve the Company again anywhere or at any
time, and have appointed in his place Alexander Anamale, who has
been an Adigar for many years in the same place.In giving him this
appointment I as usual obtained the verbal and written opinions of
several of the Commandeurs, who stated that he had on the whole been
vigilant and diligent in his office, but was discharged last year
by the Commission from Colombo without any reasons being known here,
to make room for the said incapable Domingo Rodrigo, who was Adigar of
Ponneryn at the time.I suppose he was taken away from there to please
the Wannia chiefs Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarene,
whose eldest son Gaspar, junior, was appointed Master of the Hunt,
as stated under the heading of the Wanny and Ponneryn.With regard to
the instructions to compile various lists, this order must be carried
out in so far as they are now complete.With regard to the significant
statement that the Honourable Company does not possess any lands in
Jaffnapatam, and that there is not the smallest piece of land known
of which the Company does not receive taxes, and that it therefore
would be impossible to compile a list of lands belonging to or given
away on behalf of the Company, and in case of the latter by whom, to
whom, when, why, &c., I am at a loss to follow the reasoning, and it
seems to me that there is something wrong in it, because the protocols
at the Secretariate here show that during the years 1695, 1696, and
1697 five pieces of land were given away by Mr.Zwaardecroon himself,
and this without the least knowledge or consent of His Excellency the
Governor; while, on the other hand, I know that there are still many
fields in the Provinces which are lying waste and have never been
cultivated; so that they belong to the Company and no one else.At
present the inhabitants send their cattle to these lands to graze,
as the animals would otherwise destroy their cultivated fields,
but in the beginning all lands were thus lying waste.With a view
to find out how many more of these lands there are here, and where
they are situated, I have instructed the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho,
to draw up a list of them from the newly compiled Thombo, beginning
with the two Provinces Willigamme and Waddamoraatschie, the Thombo of
which is completed; the other three Provinces must be taken up later
on.Perhaps the whole thing could be done on one sheet of paper, and
it need not take two years, nor do we want the whole Thombo in several
reams of imperial paper.Bolscho
return from their work at the road to Putulang, this work must be
taken in hand and the list submitted as soon as possible.I also do
not see the difficulty of compiling a list of all the small pieces
of land which, in the compiling of the new Thombo, were discovered on
re-survey to have been unlawfully taken possession of.Since my arrival
here I had two such lists prepared for the Provinces Willigamme and
Waddamoraatschie covering two sheets of paper each.This work was well
worth the trouble, as the pieces of cultivated land in the Province
of Willigamme amounted to 299,977 1/2 and in Waddamoraatschie to
128,013 roods, making altogether 427,990 1/2 roods.These, it is
said, might be sold to the present owners for about Rds.I
think it would be best if these lands were publicly leased out, so
that the people could show their deeds.I think this would not be
unreasonable, and consider it would be sufficient favour to them,
since they have had the use of the lands for so many years without
ever paying taxes.When the new Thombo is compiled for the Provinces
of Patchelepalle and Timmeraatsche and the six inhabited islands,
some lands will surely be discovered there also.H.--It is in compliance with instructions, and with my approbation,
that the accounts with the purchasers of elephants in Golconda and
with the Brahmin Timmerza have been settled.For various reasons which
it is not necessary to state here he is never to be employed as the
Company's broker again, the more so as the old custom of selling the
elephants by public auction has been reintroduced this year, as has
been mentioned in detail under the heading of Trade.Your Honours must comply with our orders contained in the letter
of May 4 last from Colombo, as to how the cheques from Golconda are
to be drawn up and entered in the books.With regard to the special
request of the merchants that the amount due to them might be paid in
cash or elephants through the said Timmerza to their attorneys, this
does not appear in their letter of December 7, 1696, from Golconda,
but the principal purchasers of elephants request that the Company
may assist the people sent by them in the obtaining of vessels, and,
if necessary, give them an advance of 300 or 400 Pagodas, stating
that these had been the only reasons why they had consented to deal
with the said Timmerza.In our letter of May 4 Your Honours have been
informed that His Excellency Laurens Pit, Governor of Coromandel, has
consented at our request to communicate with you whenever necessary, as
the means of the Golconda merchants who desire to obtain advances from
the Company, and how much could be advanced to their attorneys.Such
cases must be carefully dealt with, but up to the present no such
request has been made, which is so much the better.I.--The 20,000 paras or 866 2/3 lasts of nely applied for from
Negapatam will come in useful here, although since the date of this
Memoir or the 6th of June the Council agreed to purchase on behalf
of the Company the 125 1/5 lasts of rice brought here in the Bengal
ship of the Nabob of Kateck Caim Caareham, because even this does
not bring the quantity in store to the 600 lasts which are considered
necessary for Jaffnapatam, as is shown under the heading of provisions
and ammunition.It will be necessary to encourage the people from
Bengal in this trade, as has been repeatedly stated.K.--The petition mentioned here, submitted by the bargemen of the
Company's pontons, stating that they have been made to pay all that
had been lost on various cargoes of rice above one per cent., that they
had not been fairly dealt with in the measuring, &c., deserves serious
investigation.It must be seen to that these people are not made to
refund any loss for which they are not responsible and which they could
not prevent, and the annexed recommendation should be followed as far
as reasonable.The point of the unfair measuring must be especially
attended to, since such conduct would deserve severe correction.L.--The instructions given here with regard to the receipt of Pagodas
must be carried out, but none but Negapatam or Palicatte Pagodas
must be received or circulated.Our instructions under the heading
of Golden Pagodas must be observed.M.--The Dessave de Bitter is to employ the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz
in the Public Works Department on his return from Putulang after the
transport of the elephants, being a capable man for this work.The most
necessary work must be carried out first.van Keulen and Petitfilz, presented the son of the deceased
Don Philip Sangerepulle with a horse and a sombreer [83] by order
of His Excellency the Governor, apparently because he was the chief
of the highest caste, or on account of his father's services.Much
has been said against the father, but nothing has been proved, and
indeed greater scoundrels might be found on investigation.Zwaardecroon, because no act of authority was shown
to him, has rejected this presentation and ordered the Political
Council here from the yacht "Bekenstyn" on March 29 of this year to
demand back from the youth this horse and sombreer.This having been
done without my knowledge and consent, I countermand this order, and
expect Your Honours to carry out the orders of His late Excellency the
Governor.[84] With regard to the administration of this Commandement,
I have stated what was necessary under the heading of the Form of
Government at the conclusion of the Memoir to which I herewith refer.I
will only add here that since then I have had reason to doubt whether
my instructions with regard to the Political Council and the manner
in which the administration is to be carried out has been properly
understood.I reiterate therefore that the Dessave de Bitter will be
looked upon and respected as the Chief in the Commandement during
the absence of the Commandeur, and that to him is entrusted the
duty of convening the meetings both of the Political Council and of
the Court of Justice.Also that he will pass and sign all orders,
such as those for the Warehouses, the Treasury, the Workshop, the
Arsenal, and other of the Company's effects.Further, that when he
stays over night in the Castle, he is to give out the watch-word and
see to the opening and the closing of the gates, which, in the event
of his absence, is deputed to the Captain.The Dessave will see that
order and discipline are maintained, especially among the military,
and also that they are regularly drilled.He is further to receive
the daily reports, not only of the military but also of all master
workmen, &c.; in short, he is to carry out all work just as if the
Commandeur were present.Recommending thus far and thus briefly these
instructions as a guidance to the Administrateur and the Political
Council, and praying God's blessing--


I remain, Sirs, etc.,

to explain the discrepancy in the total.[17] This is the pure Arabic word, from which the word Shroff in our
local vocabulary is derived.[20] A variation in spelling of chicos.[21] Commandeur Floris Blom died at Jaffna on July 3, 1694, and is

person employed in the transaction.[28] The juice of the palmyra fruit dried into cakes.[34] Bananas: the word is in use in Java.[36] This has been translated into English, and forms an Appendix to
the Memoir of Governor Ryckloff van Goens, junior, to be had at the

the course of time its local value appears to have depreciated, and as
a denomination of currency it came to represent only 48 stivers.Yet
to preserve a fictitious identity with the original rix-dollar, the
local mint turned out stivers of lower value, of which 60 were made
to correspond to 48 of the Dutch stivers.[38] In China a picol is equal to 133-1/3 lb.[39] Probably the Malay word bahar.The

a voyage from Ceylon to Surat.[61] The church was completed in 1706, during the administration of
Commandeur Adam van der Duyn.[62] "Van geen oude schoenen te verwerpen, voor dat men met nieuwe

destroyed or lost with the rest of the Jaffna records; and there is
no copy in the Archives at Colombo.But an older report of Commandeur
Blom dated 1690 will be translated for this series.[66] The figures are as given in the MS.It is difficult to reconcile
these equivalents with the rate of 3 guilders to the rix-dollar.The
denominations given under florins (guilders) are as follows:--16
abassis = 1 stiver; 20 stivers = 1 florin.[68] Hendrick Zwaardecroon.[71] A fanam, according to Valentyn's table, was equal to 5 stivers.[72] During the early years of the Dutch rule in Ceylon there was,

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again

her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,

oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,

thought they were going to marry somebody--that really doesn't want to
marry them?It might be all a mistake, you know.""I don't think it's a mistake.Margaret found the rest of her story harder to tell than she had
anticipated.Eleanor, wrapped in the formidable aloofness of the
sensitive young, was already suffering from the tale she had come to
tell,--why, it was not so easy to determine.It might be merely from
the pang of being shut out from confidences that she felt should have
been shared with her at once.She waited until they were both ready for bed (their rooms were
connecting)--Eleanor in the straight folds of her white dimity
nightgown, and her two golden braids making a picture that lingered in
Margaret's memory for many years."It would have been easier to tell
her in her street clothes," she thought."I wish her profile were not
so perfect, or her eyes were shallower.How can I hurt such a lovely
thing?""Are the ten Hutchinsons all right?""The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.They like me better now
that I have grown a nice hard Hutchinson shell that doesn't show my
feelings through.Haven't you noticed how much more like other people
I've grown, Eleanor?""You've grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter, but I don't think you're
very much like anybody else, Aunt Margaret.""I have though,--every one notices it.You haven't asked me anything
about Peter yet," she added suddenly.The lovely color glowed in Eleanor's cheeks for an instant."I haven't heard from him for a
long time.""Yes, he's well," Margaret said."He's looking better than he was for
a while.He had some news to tell us too, Eleanor."He
said that he hadn't the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.We're as much puzzled about him as we are about the other two.""It's Aunt Beulah," Eleanor said.She sat upright on the edge of the bed and stared straight ahead of
her.Margaret watched the light and life and youth die out of the face
and a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it."I don't think it's Beulah," Margaret said."Beulah knows who it is,
but I never thought of it's being Beulah herself.""If she knows--then she's the one.He wouldn't have told her first if
she hadn't been.""Don't let it hurt you too much, dear.Gertrude--and me, too, Eleanor.It's--it's pain to us all.""Do you mean--Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?""Yes, dear," Margaret smiled at her bravely."And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle Jimmie?""She has for a good many years, I think.""I didn't know that," she said.She
pushed Margaret's arm away from her gently, but her breath came hard."Don't touch me," she cried, "I can't bear it.You might not want
to--if you knew.As Margaret closed the door gently between them, she saw Eleanor throw
her head back, and push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,
as if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.*       *       *       *       *

The next morning Eleanor was gone.Margaret had listened for hours in
the night but had heard not so much as the rustle of a garment from
the room beyond.Toward morning she had fallen into the sleep of
exhaustion.It was then that the stricken child had made her escape."Miss Hamlin had found that she must take the early train," the clerk
said, "and left this note for Miss Hutchinson."It was like Eleanor to
do things decently and in order.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Aunt Margaret," her letter ran."My grandmother used to say that
some people were trouble breeders.On thinking it over I am afraid
that is just about what I am,--a trouble breeder."I've been a worry and bother and care to you all since the beginning,
and I have repaid all your kindness by bringing trouble upon you.I don't think I have any right to
tell you exactly in this letter.I can only pray that it will be found
to be all a mistake, and come out right in the end.Surely such
beautiful people as you and Uncle David can find the way to each
other, and can help Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Gertrude, who are a little
blinder about life.Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the
way, you four will walk together beautifully.Please try, Aunt
Margaret, to make things as right as if I had never helped them to go
wrong.I was so young, I didn't know how to manage.I shall never be
that kind of young again."You know the other reason why I am going.Please do not let any one
else know.If the others could think I had met with some accident,
don't you think that would be the wisest way?I would like to arrange
it so they wouldn't try to find me at all, but would just mourn for me
naturally for a little while.I thought of sticking my old cap in the
river, but I was afraid that would be too hard for you.There won't be
any use in trying to find me.I couldn't
ever bear seeing one of your faces again.Don't let Uncle Peter _know_, please, Aunt Margaret.I don't want him
to know,--I don't want to hurt him, and I don't want him to know.Good-by, my dears, my dearests.I
have taken all of my allowance money.CHAPTER XXII

THE SEARCH


Eleanor had not bought a ticket at the station, Margaret ascertained,
but the ticket agent had tried to persuade her to.She had thanked him
and told him that she preferred to buy it of the conductor.He was a
lank, saturnine individual and had been seriously smitten with
Eleanor's charms, it appeared, and the extreme solicitousness of his
attitude at the suggestion of any mystery connected with her departure
made Margaret realize the caution with which it would be politic to
proceed.She had very little hope of finding Eleanor back at the
school, but it was still rather a shock when she telephoned the school
office and found that there was no news of her there.She concocted a
somewhat lame story to account for Eleanor's absence and promised the
authorities that she would be sent back to them within the week,--a
promise she was subsequently obliged to acknowledge that she could not
keep.Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous news to the
others.She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the pitiful letter Eleanor
had left behind her, and together they wept over it.Also together,
they faced David and Jimmie."She went away," Margaret told them, "both because she felt she was
hurting those that she loved and because she herself was hurt.""I mean--that she belonged body and soul to Peter and to nobody else,"
Margaret answered deliberately."If that is true," he said, "then I am largely responsible for her
going.""It is I who am responsible," Jimmie groaned aloud."I asked her to
marry me and she refused me.""I asked her to marry me and didn't give her the chance to refuse,"
David said; "it is that she is running away from.""It was Peter's engagement that was the last straw," Margaret said."The poor baby withered and shrank like a flower in the blast when I
told her that.""The damned hound--" Jimmie said feelingly and without apology."Eleanor says it's Beulah, and the more I think of it the more I think
that she's probably right.""That would be a nice mess, wouldn't it?""Remember how frank we were with her about his probable lack of
judgment, Margaret?I don't covet the sweet job of breaking it to
either one of them."Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it to them both late that
same afternoon at Beulah's apartment."I'll find her," Peter said briefly.And in response to the halting
explanation of her disappearance that Margaret and Gertrude had done
their best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical nature, he
only said, "I don't see that it makes any difference why she's gone.She's gone, that's the thing that's important.No matter how hard we
try we can't really figure out her reason till we find her.""Are you sure it's going to be so easy?"She's a pretty determined little person when she
makes up her mind.Eleanor's threats are to be taken seriously."I'll find her if she's anywhere in the world," Peter said."I'll find
her and bring her back.""I believe that you will," she said."Find out the reason that she
went away, too, Peter."Beulah pulled Gertrude aside."She had some one else
on her mind, hadn't she?""She had something else on her mind," Gertrude answered gravely, "but
she had Peter on her mind, too.""She didn't--she couldn't have known about us--Peter and me.We--we
haven't told any one."It's
just one of God's most satirical mix-ups.""I was to blame," Beulah said slowly."I don't believe in shifting
responsibility.I got her here in the first place and I've been
instrumental in guiding her life ever since.Now, I've sacrificed her
to my own happiness.""It isn't so simple as that," Gertrude said; "the things we start
going soon pass out of our hands.Somebody a good deal higher up has
been directing Eleanor's affairs for a long time,--and ours too, for
that matter.""Don't worry, Beulah," Peter said, making his way to her side from the
other corner of the room where he had been talking to Margaret."You
mustn't let this worry you.We've all got to be--soldiers now,--but
we'll soon have her back again, I promise you.""And I promise you," Beulah said chokingly, "that if you'll get her
back again, I--I will be a soldier."*       *       *       *       *

Peter began by visiting the business schools in New York and finding
out the names of the pupils registered there.Eleanor had clung firmly
to her idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some magazine
office, no matter how hard he had worked to dissuade her.He felt
almost certain she would follow out that purpose now.There was a fund
in her name started some years before for the defraying of her college
expenses.She would use that, he argued, to get herself started, even
though she felt constrained to pay it back later on.He worked on this
theory for some time, even making a trip to Boston in search for her
in the stenography classes there, but nothing came of it.Among Eleanor's effects sent on from the school was a little red
address book containing the names and addresses of many of her former
schoolmates at Harmon.Peter wrote all the girls he remembered hearing
her speak affectionately of, but not one of them was able to give him
any news of her.He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina's aunt, who had
served in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor's grandfather in his
last days, and got in reply a pious letter from Albertina herself, who
intimated that she had always suspected that Eleanor would come to
some bad end, and that now she was highly soothed and gratified by the
apparent fulfillment of her sinister prognostications.Later he tried private detectives, and, not content with their
efforts, he followed them over the ground that they covered, searching
through boarding houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing
the editorial offices of the various magazines Eleanor had admired in
the hope of discovering that she had applied for some small position
there; following every clue that his imagination, and the acumen of
the professionals in his service, could supply;--but his patient
search was unrewarded.Eleanor had apparently vanished from the
surface of the earth.The quest which had seemed to him so simple a
matter when he first undertook it, now began to assume terrible and
abortive proportions.It was unthinkable that one little slip of a
girl untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently to elude
six determined and worldly adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax
their resources to the utmost in the effort to find her,--but the fact
remained that she was missing and continued to be missing, and the
cruel month went by and brought them no news of her.Apart from the emotions
that had been precipitated by her developing charms, they loved her
dearly as the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed all
their young enthusiasm and energy and tenderness upon.She was the
living clay, as Gertrude had said so many years before, that they had
molded as nearly as possible to their hearts' desire.They loved her
for herself, but one and all they loved her for what they had made of
her--an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease in a world that
might so easily have crushed her utterly if they had not intervened
for her.They kept up the search unremittingly, following false leads and
meeting with heartbreaking discouragements and disappointments.Only
Margaret had any sense of peace about her."I'm sure she's all right," she said; "I feel it.It's hard having her
gone, but I'm not afraid for her.She'll work it out better than we
could help her to.It's a beautiful thing to be young and strong and
free, and she'll get the beauty out of it.""I think perhaps you're right, Margaret," David said.It's the bread and butter end of the problem that worries
me.""He'll provide for our ewe lamb, I'm
sure.""You speak as if you had it on direct authority.""I think perhaps I have," she said gravely.Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as the weeks passed, and the
strain of their fruitless quest continued.One day Jimmie showed her
the letter that Eleanor had written him.he said, as Gertrude returned it to him, smiling
through her tears."She's a darling," Gertrude said fervently."Did she hurt you so much,
Jimmie dear?""I wanted her," Jimmie answered slowly, "but I think it was because I
thought she was mine,--that I could make her mine.When I found she
was Peter's,--had been Peter's all the time, the thought somehow cured
me.I made it up out of the stuff that
dreams are made of.God knows I love her, but--but that personal thing
has gone out of it.She's my little lost child,--or my sister.A man
wants his own to be his own, Gertrude.""My--my real trouble is that I'm at sea again.I thought that I
cared,--that I was anchored for good.It's the drifting that plays the
deuce with me.If the thought of that sweet child and the grief at her
loss can't hold me, what can?"I don't know," Gertrude laughed.You've always been on to me, Gertrude, too much so
to have any respect for me, I guess.You've got your work," he waved
his arm at the huge cast under the shadow of which they were sitting,
"and all this.You can put all your human longings into it.I'm a poor
rudderless creature without any hope or direction.""You don't know it," he said, with an effort to conceal
the fact that his shoulders were shaking, "but you see before you a
human soul in the actual process of dissolution."Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down beside him.She drew
the boyish head, rumpled into an irresistible state of curliness, to
her breast."Put it here where it belongs," she said softly."I snitched him," Gertrude confided to Margaret some days later,--her
whole being radiant and transfigured with happiness.CHAPTER XXIII

THE YOUNG NURSE


The local hospital of the village of Harmonville, which was ten miles
from Harmon proper, where the famous boarding-school for young ladies
was located, presented an aspect so far from institutional that but
for the sign board tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the
break in the hedge that constituted the main entrance, the gracious,
old colonial structure might have been taken for the private residence
for which it had served so many years.It was a crisp day in late September, and a pale yellow sun was spread
thin over the carpet of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was
covered.In the upper corridor of the west wing, grouped about the
window-seat with their embroidery or knitting, the young nurses were
talking together in low tones during the hour of the patients'
siestas.The two graduates, dark-eyed efficient girls, with skilled
delicate fingers taking precise stitches in the needlework before
them, were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered about
them, beginners for the most part, but a few months in training, were
dressed in the simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons, of
the probationary period.A light breeze blew in at
the window and stirred a straying lock or two that escaped the
starched band of a confining cap.Outside the stinging whistle of the
insect world was interrupted now and then by the cough of a passing
motor.From the doors opening on the corridor an occasional restless
moan indicated the inability of some sufferer to take his dose of
oblivion according to schedule.Presently a bell tinkled a summons to
the patient in the first room on the right--a gentle little old lady
who had just had her appendix removed."Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?"the nurse in charge of the case
asked the tallest and fairest of the young assistants.Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief as the most ravishing
of young Priscillas, rose obediently at the request."May I read to
her a little if she wants me to?""Yes, if you keep the door closed.I think most of the others are
sleeping."The little old lady who had just had her appendix out, smiled weakly
up at Eleanor."I hoped 'twould be you," she said, "and then after I'd rung I lay in
fear and trembling lest one o' them young flipperti-gibbets should
come, and get me all worked up while she was trying to shift me.I
want to be turned the least little mite on my left side."Eleanor asked, as she made the adjustment."I dunno whether that's better, or whether it just seems better to me,
because 'twas you that fixed me," the little old lady said."You
certainly have got a soothin' and comfortin' way with you.""I used to take care of my grandmother years ago, and the more
hospital work I do, the more it comes back to me,--and the better I
remember the things that she liked to have done for her.""There's nobody like your own kith and kin," the little old lady
sighed.That other nurse--that black
haired one--she said you was an orphan, alone in the world.Well, I
pity a young girl alone in the world.""It's all right to be alone in the world--if you just keep busy
enough," Eleanor said."But you mustn't talk any more.I'm going to
give you your medicine and then sit here and read to you."*       *       *       *       *

On the morning of her flight from the inn, after a night spent staring
motionless into the darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some
dozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old friend Bertha Stephens
lived.To "Stevie," to whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to
draw her very close in the ensuing year, she told a part of her story.Stephens, whose husband was on
the board of directors of the Harmonville hospital, that Eleanor had
been admitted there.She had resolutely put all her old life behind
her.The plan to take up a course in stenography and enter an
editorial office was to have been, as a matter of course, a part of
her life closely associated with Peter.Losing him, there was nothing
left of her dream of high adventure and conquest.There was merely the
hurt desire to hide herself where she need never trouble him again,
and where she could be independent and useful.Having no idea of her
own value to her guardians, or the integral tenderness in which she
was held, she sincerely believed that her disappearance must have
relieved them of much chagrin and embarrassment.She had the
temperament that finds a virtue in the day's work, and a balm in its
mere iterative quality.Her sympathy and intelligence made her a good
nurse and her adaptability, combined with her loveliness, a general
favorite.She spent her days off at the Stephens' home.Bertha Stephens had been
the one girl that Peter had failed to write to, when he began to
circulate his letters of inquiry.Her name had been set down in the
little red book, but he remembered the trouble that Maggie Lou had
precipitated, and arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing
between Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.Except that Carlo
Stephens persisted in trying to make love to her, and Mrs.Stephens
covertly encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the Stephens' home a
very comforting haven.Bertha had developed into a full breasted,
motherly looking girl, passionately interested in all vicarious
love-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the thought of having any
of her own.She was devoted to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for the relief and
solace of self-expression.*       *       *       *       *

"It is five months to-day," she wrote, "since I came to the hospital.I like it, but I feel like the little old
woman on the King's Highway.I doubt more every minute if this can be
I. Sometimes I wonder what 'being I' consists of, anyway.I used to
feel as if I were divided up into six parts as separate as
protoplasmic cells, and that each one was looked out for by a
different cooperative parent.I thought that I would truly be I when I
got them all together, and looked out for them myself, but I find I am
no more of an entity than I ever was.The puzzling question of 'what
am I?'still persists, and I am farther away from the right answer
than ever.Would a sound be a sound if there were no one to hear it?If the waves of vibration struck no human ear, would the sound be in
existence at all?This is the problem propounded by one of the nurses
yesterday."How much of us lives when we are entirely shut out of the
consciousness of those whom we love?If there is no one to _realize_
us day by day,--if all that love has made of us is taken away, what is
left?I look in the glass, and see
the same face,--Eleanor Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same bow
shaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge leading up from her nose to
her mouth, making her look still very babyish.I pinch myself, and
find that it hurts just the same as it used to six months ago, but
there the resemblance to what I used to be, stops.I'm a young nurse
now in hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I do say it as
shouldn't; but that's all I am.Otherwise, I'm not anybody _to_
anybody,--except a figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn't
count in this kind of reckoning.I take naturally to nursing they tell
me.A nurse is a kind of maternal automaton.I'm glad I'm that, but
there used to be a lot more of me than that.There ought to be some
heart and brain and soul left over, but there doesn't seem to be.Perhaps I am like the Princess in the fairy story whose heart was an
auk's egg.Nobody had power to make her feel unless they reached it
and squeezed it."I feel sometimes as if I were dead.I wish I could know whether Uncle
Peter and Aunt Beulah were married yet.There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor married some one else,
and she has nervous prostration, and melancholia.All she does all day
is to moan and wring her hands and call out his name.They seem to think that it is disgraceful to
love a man so much that your whole life stops as soon as he goes out
of it.What of Juliet and Ophelia and Francesca de Rimini?They loved
so they could not tear their love out of their hearts without
lacerating them forever.There is that kind of love in the
world,--bigger than life itself.All the big tragedies of literature
were made from it,--why haven't people more sympathy for it?Why isn't
there more dignity about it in the eyes of the world?"It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that which you cherish, but
it is unluckier still never to know the meaning of love, or to find
'Him whom your soul loveth.'I try to be kind to that poor forsaken
woman.I am sorry for his sake that she calls out his name, but she
seems to be in such torture of mind and body that she is unable to
help it."They are trying to cut down expenses here, so they have no regular
cook, the housekeeper and her helper are supposed to do it all.I said
I would make the desserts, so now I have got to go down-stairs and
make some fruit gelatin.It is best that I should not write any more
to-day, anyway."*       *       *       *       *

Later, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she wrote:

                  *       *       *       *       *

"I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall never forget it.It
is wicked to speak of Doctor Blake's clean cut work as butchery, but
when you actually see a child's leg severed from its body, what else
can you call it?"The reason that I am able to go through operations without fainting
or crying is just this: _other people do_.The first time I stood by
the operating table to pass the sterilized instruments to the
assisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors hung in rubber
standing there preparing to carve their way through the naked flesh of
the unconscious creature before them, I felt the kind of pang pass
through my heart that seems to kill as it comes.I thought I died, or
was dying,--and then I looked up and saw that every one else was ready
for their work.So I drew a deep breath and became ready too.I don't
think there is anything in the world too hard to do if you look at it
that way."The little boy loved me and I loved him.We had hoped against hope
that we would be able to save his poor little leg, but it had to go.I
held his hand while they gave him the chloroform.At his head sat
Doctor Hathaway with his Christlike face, draped in the robe of the
anesthetist.'Take long breaths, Benny,' I said, and he breathed in
bravely.To-morrow, when he is really out of the
ether, I have got to tell him what was done to him.Something happened
to me while that operation was going on.I think
the spirit of the one who was his mother passed into me, and I knew
what it would be like to be the mother of a son.Benny was not without
what his mother would have felt for him if she had been at his side.I can't explain it, but that is what I felt."To-night it is as black as ink outside.I feel as
if there should be no stars.If there were, there might be some
strange little bit of comfort in them that I could cling to.I do not
want any comfort from outside to shine upon me to-night.I have got to
draw all my strength from a source within, and I feel it welling up
within me even now."I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the people I love so long
without any word of me.I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt
Margaret all had a mother feeling for me.I am remembering to-night
how anxious they used to be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep
my feet dry, and not to work too hard at school.All those things that
I took as a matter of course, I realize now were very significant and
beautiful.If I had a child and did not know to-night where it would
lie down to sleep, or on what pillow it would put its head, I know my
own rest would be troubled.I wonder if I have caused any one of my
dear mothers to feel like that.If I have, it has been very wicked and
cruel of me."CHAPTER XXIV

CHRISTMAS AGAIN


The ten Hutchinsons having left the library entirely alone in the hour
before dinner, David and Margaret had appropriated it and were sitting
companionably together on the big couch drawn up before the fireplace,
where a log was trying to consume itself unscientifically head first."I would stay to dinner if urged," David suggested."You stay," Margaret agreed laconically.She moved away from him, relaxing rather limply in the corner of the
couch, with a hand dangling over the farther edge of it."You're an inconsistent being," David said."You buoy all the rest of
us up with your faith in the well-being of our child, and then you
pine yourself sick over her absence."We always had such a beautiful time on
Christmas.It isn't like
Christmas at all with her gone from us.""Do you remember how crazy she was over the ivory set?"David's eyes kindled at the
reminiscence.Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly, and clasped her hands
about her knees."I haven't seen you do that for years," he said."I was just wondering--" but she stopped
herself suddenly.David was watching her narrowly, and perceiving it,
she flushed."This is not my idea of an interesting conversation," she said; "it's
getting too personal.""I can remember the time when you told me that you didn't find things
interesting unless they were personal.'I like things very personal,'
you said--in those words.""The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most personal part of me is
frozen stiff.""I never saw a warmer creature in my life," David protested."On that
same occasion you said that being a woman was about like being a field
of clover in an insectless world.You don't feel that way nowadays,
surely,--at the rate the insects have been buzzing around you this
winter.I've counted at least seven, three bees, one or two beetles, a
butterfly and a worm.""I didn't know you paid that much attention to my poor affairs."If you hadn't put your foot down firmly on the worm, I
had every intention of doing so.""On that occasion to which you refer I remember I also said that I had
a queer hunch about Eleanor.""Margaret, are you deliberately changing the subject?""Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.""I said," Margaret ignored his interruption, "that I had the feeling
that she was going to be a storm center and bring some kind of queer
trouble upon us.""I'm not so sure that's the way to put it," David said gravely."We
brought queer trouble on her.""She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever had in its life," David
corrected her."Look here, Margaret, I want you to know the truth
about that.I--I stumbled into that, you know.She was so sweet, and
before I knew it I had--I found myself in the attitude of making love
to her.Well, there was nothing to do but go through with it.I felt like Pygmalion--but it was all potential,
unrealized--and ass that I was, I assumed that she would have no other
idea in the matter.I was going to marry her because I--I had started
things going, you know.I had no choice even if I had wanted one.It
never occurred to me that she might have a choice, and so I went on
trying to make things easy for her, and getting them more tangled at
every turn."With characteristic idiocy I was
keeping out of the picture until the time was ripe.She really ran
away to get away from the situation I created and she was quite right
too.If I weren't haunted by these continual pictures of our offspring
in the bread line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that she's
shaken us all till we get our breath back.Poor Peter is the one who
is smashed, though."You wouldn't smile if you were engaged to Beulah.""Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn't wear it often.""Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.""That leaves only us two," David suggested."Margaret, dear, do you
think the time will ever come when I shall get you back again?"Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his look steadily."The answer to that is 'yes,' as you very well know.Time was when we
were very close--you and I, then somehow we lost the way to each
other.I'm beginning to realize that it hasn't been the same world
since and isn't likely to be unless you come back to me.""It was I; but it was you who put the bars up and have kept them
there.""Was I to let the bars down and wait at the gate?"It should be that way between us, Margaret, shouldn't
it?""I don't know," Margaret said, "I don't know."She flashed a sudden
odd look at him."If--when I put the bars down, I shall run for my
life."Warning is all I want," David said contentedly.He could barely reach
her hand across the intervening expanse of leather couch, but he
accomplished it,--he was too wise to move closer to her."You're a
lovely, lovely being," he said reverently."God grant I may reach you
and hold you.""To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other day.I told her the
Eleanor story, and that rather brought her to her senses.She wouldn't
have liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds are plucked,
and she wants me to settle down.""Does she think I'm a settling kind of person?""She wouldn't if she knew the way you go to my head," David murmured."Oh, she thinks that you'll do."Maybe I'd like them better considered as connections of yours,"
Margaret said abstractedly.David lifted the warm little finger to his lips and kissed it
swiftly.he asked, as she slipped away from him and
stood poised in the doorway."I'm going to put on something appropriate to the occasion," she
answered.When she came back to him she was wearing the most delicate and
cobwebby of muslins with a design of pale purple passion flowers
trellised all over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment alone
with her all the rest of the evening.Sometime later she showed him Eleanor's parting letter, and he was
profoundly touched by the pathetic little document.As the holidays approached Eleanor's absence became an almost
unendurable distress to them all.The annual Christmas dinner party, a
function that had never been omitted since the acquisition of David's
studio, was decided on conditionally, given up, and again decided on."We do want to see one another on Christmas day,--we've got presents
for one another, and Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her
going away had settled that big a cloud on us.She slipped out of our
lives in order to bring us closer together.We'll get closer together
for her sake," Margaret decided.But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost more than they had
reckoned on.Every detail of traditional ceremony was observed even to
the mound of presents marked with each name piled on the same spot on
the couch, to be opened with the serving of the coffee."I got something for Eleanor," Jimmie remarked shamefacedly as he
added his contributions to the collection."Thought we could keep it
for her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something."I guess everybody else got her something, too," Margaret said."Of
course we will keep them for her.I got her a little French party
coat.It will be just as good next year as this.Anyhow as Jimmie
says, I had to get it.""I got her slipper buckles," Gertrude admitted."I got her the Temple _Shakespeare_," Beulah added."She was always
carrying around those big volumes.""You're looking better, Beulah," Margaret said."Jimmie says I'm looking more human.I guess perhaps that's it,--I'm
feeling more--human.I needed humanizing--even at the expense of
some--some heartbreak," she said bravely.Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on Beulah's chair-arm, and
slipped an arm around her."You're all right if you know that," she whispered softly."I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor herself," Peter said."I
got on the trail of a girl working in a candy shop out in Yonkers.My
faithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was ass enough to
believe he knew what he was talking about.When I got out there I
found a strawberry blonde with gold teeth.""Gosh, you don't think she's doing anything like that," Jimmie
exclaimed."I don't know," Peter said miserably.He was looking ill and unlike
himself.His deep set gray eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow
was too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his jaws."As a
de-tec-i-tive, I'm afraid I'm a failure.""We're all failures for that matter," David said.Eleanor's empty place, set with the liqueur glass she always drank her
thimbleful of champagne in, and the throne chair from the drawing-room
in which she presided over the feasts given in her honor, was almost
too much for them.Peter shaded
his eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie groped for each
other's hands under the shelter of the table-cloth."This--this won't do," David said.He turned to Beulah on his left,
sitting immovable, with her eyes staring unseeingly into the
centerpiece of holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly."We must either turn this into a kind of a wake, and kneel as we
feast, or we must try to rise above it somehow.""I don't see why," Jimmie argued."I'm in favor of each man howling
informally as he listeth.""Let's drink her health anyhow," David insisted."I cut out the
Sauterne and the claret, so we could begin on the wine at once in this
contingency.Here's to our beloved and dear absent daughter.""Long may she wave," Jimmie cried, stumbling to his feet an instant
after the others.While they were still standing with their glasses uplifted, the bell
rang."Don't let anybody in, Alphonse," David admonished him.They all turned in the direction of the hall, but there was no sound
of parley at the front door.Eleanor had put a warning finger to her
lips, as Alphonse opened it to find her standing there.She stripped
off her hat and her coat as she passed through the drawing-room, and
stood in her little blue cloth traveling dress between the portieres
that separated it from the dining-room.The six stood transfixed at
the sight of her, not believing the vision of their eyes."You're drinking my health," she cried, as she stretched out her arms
to them.my dears, and my dearests, will you forgive me for
running away from you?"CHAPTER XXV

THE LOVER


They left her alone with Peter in the drawing room in the interval
before the coffee, seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his
eyes had not left her face since the moment of her spectacular
appearance between the portieres."I'm not going to marry you, Peter," Beulah whispered, as she slipped
by him to the door, "don't think of me.But Peter was almost past coherent thought or speech as they stood
facing each other on the hearth-rug,--Eleanor's little head up and her
breath coming lightly between her sweet, parted lips."How could you, dear--how could
you,--how could you?""I'm back all safe, now, Uncle Peter."I'm sorry I made you all that trouble," Eleanor said, "but I thought
it would be the best thing to do.""Tell me why," Peter said, "tell me why, I've suffered so
much--wondering--wondering.""I thought it was only I who did the
suffering."She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter gripped her hard by the
shoulders.Then his lips met hers dumbly,
beseechingly.*       *       *       *       *

"It was all a mistake,--my going away," she wrote some days after."I
ought to have stayed at the school, and graduated, and then come down
to New York, and faced things.I have my lesson now about facing
things.If any other crisis comes into my life, I hope I shall be as
strong as Dante was, when he'showed himself more furnished with
breath than he was,' and said, 'Go on, for I am strong and resolute.'I think we always have more strength than we understand ourselves to
have."I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David and Aunt Margaret, and I
know Uncle Jimmie needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.Did
my going away help those things to their fruition?"I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I know that I must bear
to think of her, and face the pain of having hurt her as I must face
every other thing that comes into my life from this hour.I would give
her back Peter, if I could,--but I can not.He is mine, and I am his,
and we have been that way from the beginning.I have thought of him
always as stronger and wiser than any one in the world, but I don't
think he is.He has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to do
right, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his life like any man, just
the way Uncle Jimmie and Uncle David did."Don't men know who it is they love?They seem so often to be
struggling hungrily after the wrong thing, trying to get, or to make
themselves take, some woman that they do not really want.When women
love it is not like that with them.I think I have loved Peter from the first minute I
saw him, so beautiful and dear and sweet, with that _anxious_ look in
his eyes,--that look of consideration for the other person that is
always so much a part of him.He had it the first night I saw him,
when Uncle David brought me to show me to my foster parents for the
first time.It was the thing I grew up by, and measured men and their
attitude to women by--just that look in his eyes, that tender warm
look of consideration."It means a good many things, I think,--a gentle generous nature, and
a tender chivalrous heart.It means being a
good man, and one who _protects_ by sheer unselfish instinct.I don't
know how I shall ever heal him of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah.Aunt Margaret tells me that Aunt Beulah's experience with him has been
the thing that has made her whole, that she needed to live through the
human cycle of emotion--of love and possession and renunciation before
she could be quite real and sound.This may be true, but it is not the
kind of reasoning for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.If a
surgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards does more good than
harm, he must not let that result absolve him from his mistake.Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter and I must go on
feeling that way about it."I want to write something down about my love before I close this book
to-night.Something that I can turn to some day and read, or show to
my children when love comes to them.'This is the way I felt,' I want
to say to them, 'the first week of my love--this is what it meant to
me.'"It means being a greater, graver, and more beautiful person than you
ever thought you could be.It means knowing what you are, and what you
were meant to be all at once, and I think it means your chance to be
purified for the life you are to live, and the things you are to do in
it.Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and points the way,
and shows you what you can be.Even if the light it sheds should grow
dim after a while, the path it has shown you should be clear to your
inner eye forever and ever.Having been in a great temple is a thing
to be better for all your life."It means that the soul and the things of the soul are
everlasting,--that they have got to be everlasting if love is like
this.Love between two people is more than the simple fact of their
being drawn together and standing hand in hand.It is the holy truth
about the universe.It is the rainbow of God's promise set over the
land.There comes with it the soul's certainty of living on and on
through time and space."Just my loving Peter and Peter's loving me isn't the important
thing,--the important thing is the way it has started the truth going;
my knowing and understanding mysterious laws that were sealed to me
before; Peter taking my life in his hands and making it consecrated
and true,--so true that I will not falter or suffer from any
misunderstandings or mistaken pain."It means warmth and light and tenderness, our love does, and all the
poetry in the world, and all the motherliness, (I feel so much like
his mother).When I say that he is not stronger or
wiser than any one in the world I mean--in living.I mean in the way
he behaves like a little bewildered boy sometimes.In loving he is
stronger and wiser than any living being.He takes my two hands in his
and gives me all the strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is
in the world."I haven't written down anything, after all, that any one could read.My children can't look over my shoulder on to this page, for they
would not understand it.It means nothing to any one in the world but
me.I shall have to translate for them or I shall have to say to them,
'Children, on looking into this book, I find I can't tell you what
love meant to me, because the words I have put down would mean nothing
to you.They were only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn back
to them, of the great glory and holiness that fell upon me like a
garment when love came.'"And if there should be any doubt in my heart as to the reality of the
feeling that has come to them in their turn, I should only have to
turn their faces up to the light, and look into their eyes and
_know_."I shall not die as my own mother did.I know that Peter
will be by my side until we both are old.These facts are established
in my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know that they are
there,--but if such a thing could be that I should die and leave my
little children, I would not be afraid to leave them alone in a world
that has been so good to me, under the protection of a Power that
provided me with the best and kindest guardians that a little orphan
ever had.God bless and keep them all, and make them happy."and I thank
you for your kindness, which has been more than I deserve.If I have at
times seemed less than thankful, it was the fault of circumstances, and
not of my will.Catharine--" He cast upon the maiden a look of strong
emotion, in which various feelings were blended.He hesitated, as if
to say something, and at length turned away with the single word
"farewell."Five minutes afterwards, with Highland buskins on his feet and a small
bundle in his hand, he passed through the north gate of Perth, and
directed his course to the Highlands."There goes enough of beggary and of pride for a whole Highland clan,"
said Henry."He talks as familiarly of gold pieces as I would of silver
pennies, and yet I will be sworn that the thumb of his mother's worsted
glove might hold the treasure of the whole clan.""Like enough," said the glover, laughing at the idea; "his mother was a
large boned woman, especially in the fingers and wrist.""And as for cattle," continued Henry, "I reckon his father and brothers
steal sheep by one at a time.""The less we say of them the better," said the glover, becoming again
grave."Brothers he hath none; his father is a powerful man--hath long
hands--reaches as far as he can, and hears farther than it is necessary
to talk of him.""And yet he hath bound his only son apprentice to a glover in Perth?""Why, I should have thought the gentle craft, as it is
called, of St.Crispin would have suited him best; and that, if the son
of some great Mac or O was to become an artisan, it could only be in the
craft where princes set him the example."This remark, though ironical, seemed to awaken our friend Simon's sense
of professional dignity, which was a prevailing feeling that marked the
manners of the artisans of the time."You err, son Henry," he replied, with much gravity: "the glovers' are
the more honourable craft of the two, in regard they provide for the
accommodation of the hands, whereas the shoemakers and cordwainers do
but work for the feet.""Both equally necessary members of the body corporate," said Henry,
whose father had been a cordwainer."It may be so, my son," said the glover; "but not both alike honourable.Bethink you, that we employ the hands as pledges of friendship and good
faith, and the feet have no such privilege.Brave men fight with their
hands; cowards employ their feet in flight.A glove is borne aloft; a
shoe is trampled in the mire.A man greets a friend with his open
hand; he spurns a dog, or one whom he holds as mean as a dog, with his
advanced foot.A glove on the point of a spear is a sign and pledge of
faith all the wide world over, as a gauntlet flung down is a gage of
knightly battle; while I know no other emblem belonging to an old shoe,
except that some crones will fling them after a man by way of good luck,
in which practice I avow myself to entertain no confidence.""Nay," said the smith, amused with his friend's eloquent pleading for
the dignity of the art he practised, "I am not the man, I promise you,
to disparage the glover's mystery.Bethink you, I am myself a maker of
gauntlets.But the dignity of your ancient craft removes not my wonder,
that the father of this Conachar suffered his son to learn a trade of
any kind from a Lowland craftsman, holding us, as they do, altogether
beneath their magnificent degree, and a race of contemptible drudges,
unworthy of any other fate than to be ill used and plundered, as often
as these bare breeched dunnie wassals see safety and convenience for
doing so.""Ay," answered the glover, "but there were powerful reasons for--for--"
he withheld something which seemed upon his lips, and went on: "for
Conachar's father acting as he did.Well, I have played fair with him,
and I do not doubt but he will act honourably by me.But Conachar's
sudden leave taking has put me to some inconvenience.said Henry Gow, deceived by the earnestness of
his manner."You!--no," said Simon, with a dryness which made Henry so sensible of
the simplicity of his proposal, that he blushed to the eyes at his own
dulness of comprehension, in a matter where love ought to have induced
him to take his cue easily up."You, Catharine," said the glover, as he left the room, "entertain your
Valentine for five minutes, and see he departs not till my return.Come
hither with me, old Dorothy, and bestir thy limbs in my behalf."He left the room, followed by the old woman; and Henry Smith remained
with Catharine, almost for the first time in his life, entirely alone.There was embarrassment on the maiden's part, and awkwardness on that
of the lover, for about a minute; when Henry, calling up his courage,
pulled the gloves out of his pocket with which Simon had supplied him,
and asked her to permit one who had been so highly graced that morning
to pay the usual penalty for being asleep at the moment when he would
have given the slumbers of a whole twelvemonth to be awake for a single
minute."Nay, but," said Catharine, "the fulfilment of my homage to St.Valentine infers no such penalty as you desire to pay, and I cannot
therefore think of accepting them.""These gloves," said Henry, advancing his seat insidiously towards
Catharine as he spoke, "were wrought by the hands that are dearest to
you; and see--they are shaped for your own."He extended them as he spoke, and taking her arm in his robust hand,
spread the gloves beside it to show how well they fitted."Look at that taper arm," he said, "look at these small fingers; think
who sewed these seams of silk and gold, and think whether the glove and
the arm which alone the glove can fit ought to remain separate, because
the poor glove has had the misfortune to be for a passing minute in the
keeping of a hand so swart and rough as mine.""They are welcome as coming from my father," said Catharine; "and surely
not less so as coming from my friend (and there was an emphasis on the
word), as well as my Valentine and preserver.""Let me aid to do them on," said the smith, bringing himself yet closer
to her side; "they may seem a little over tight at first, and you may
require some assistance.""You are skilful in such service, good Henry Gow," said the maiden,
smiling, but at the same time drawing farther from her lover."In good faith, no," said Henry, shaking his head: "my experience has
been in donning steel gauntlets on mailed knights, more than in fitting
embroidered gloves upon maidens.""I will trouble you then no further, and Dorothy shall aid me, though
there needs no assistance; my father's eye and fingers are faithful to
his craft: what work he puts through his hands is always true to the
measure.""Let me be convinced of it," said the smith--"let me see that these
slender gloves actually match the hands they were made for.""Some other time, good Henry," answered the maiden, "I will wear the
gloves in honour of St.Valentine, and the mate he has sent me for
the season.I would to Heaven I could pleasure my father as well in
weightier matters; at present the perfume of the leather harms the
headache I have had since morning.""If you call it heartache, you will not misname it," said Catharine,
with a sigh, and proceeded to speak in a very serious tone."Henry," she said, "I am going perhaps to be as bold as I gave you
reason to think me this morning; for I am about to speak the first upon
a subject on which, it may well be, I ought to wait till I had to answer
you.But I cannot, after what has happened this morning, suffer my
feelings towards you to remain unexplained, without the possibility of
my being greatly misconceived.Nay, do not answer till you have heard me
out.You are brave, Henry, beyond most men, honest and true as the steel
you work upon--"

"Stop--stop, Catharine, for mercy's sake!You never said so much that
was good concerning me, save to introduce some bitter censure, of which
your praises were the harbingers.I am honest, and so forth, you would
say, but a hot brained brawler, and common sworder or stabber.""I should injure both myself and you in calling you such.No, Henry, to
no common stabber, had he worn a plume in his bonnet and gold spurs on
his heels, would Catharine Glover have offered the little grace she has
this day voluntarily done to you.If I have at times dwelt severely upon
the proneness of your spirit to anger, and of your hand to strife, it is
because I would have you, if I could so persuade you, hate in yourself
the sins of vanity and wrath by which you are most easily beset.I have
spoken on the topic more to alarm your own conscience than to express
my opinion.I know as well as my father that, in these forlorn and
desperate days, the whole customs of our nation, nay, of every Christian
nation, may be quoted in favour of bloody quarrels for trifling causes,
of the taking deadly and deep revenge for slight offences, and the
slaughter of each other for emulation of honour, or often in mere sport.But I knew that for all these things we shall one day be called into
judgment; and fain would I convince thee, my brave and generous friend,
to listen oftener to the dictates of thy good heart, and take less pride
in the strength and dexterity of thy unsparing arm.""I am--I am convinced, Catharine" exclaimed Henry: "thy words shall
henceforward be a law to me.I have done enough, far too much, indeed,
for proof of my bodily strength and courage; but it is only from you,
Catharine, that I can learn a better way of thinking.Remember, my
fair Valentine, that my ambition of distinction in arms, and my love
of strife, if it can be called such, do not fight even handed with my
reason and my milder dispositions, but have their patrons and sticklers
to egg them on.Is there a quarrel, and suppose that I, thinking on your
counsels, am something loth to engage in it, believe you I am left to
decide between peace or war at my own choosing?there are a hundred round me to stir me on.'Why, how now, Smith, is thy
mainspring rusted?''Jolly Henry is deaf on the quarrelling
ear this morning!''Stand to it, for the honour of Perth,'
says my lord the Provost.'Harry against them for a gold noble,' cries
your father, perhaps.Now, what can a poor fellow do, Catharine, when
all are hallooing him on in the devil's name, and not a soul putting in
a word on the other side?""Nay, I know the devil has factors enough to utter his wares," said
Catharine; "but it is our duty to despise such idle arguments, though
they may be pleaded even by those to whom we owe much love and honour.""Then there are the minstrels, with their romaunts and ballads, which
place all a man's praise in receiving and repaying hard blows.It is sad
to tell, Catharine, how many of my sins that Blind Harry the Minstrel
hath to answer for.When I hit a downright blow, it is not--so save
me--to do any man injury, but only to strike as William Wallace struck."The minstrel's namesake spoke this in such a tone of rueful seriousness,
that Catharine could scarce forbear smiling; but nevertheless she
assured him that the danger of his own and other men's lives ought not
for a moment to be weighed against such simple toys."Ay, but," replied Henry, emboldened by her smiles, "methinks now
the good cause of peace would thrive all the better for an advocate.Suppose, for example, that, when I am pressed and urged to lay hand on
my weapon, I could have cause to recollect that there was a gentle and
guardian angel at home, whose image would seem to whisper, 'Henry, do no
violence; it is my hand which you crimson with blood.Henry, rush
upon no idle danger; it is my breast which you expose to injury;' such
thoughts would do more to restrain my mood than if every monk in Perth
should cry, 'Hold thy hand, on pain of bell, book, and candle.'""If such a warning as could be given by the voice of sisterly affection
can have weight in the debate," said Catharine, "do think that, in
striking, you empurple this hand, that in receiving wounds you harm this
heart."The smith took courage at the sincerely affectionate tone in which these
words were delivered."And wherefore not stretch your regard a degree beyond these cold
limits?Why, since you are so kind and generous as to own some interest
in the poor ignorant sinner before you, should you not at once adopt
him as your scholar and your husband?Your father desires it, the town
expects it, glovers and smiths are preparing their rejoicings, and you,
only you, whose words are so fair and so kind, you will not give your
consent.""Henry," said Catharine, in a low and tremulous voice, "believe me I
should hold it my duty to comply with my father's commands, were there
not obstacles invincible to the match which he proposes.""Yet think--think but for a moment.I have little to say for myself in
comparison of you, who can both read and write.But then I wish to hear
reading, and could listen to your sweet voice for ever.You love music,
and I have been taught to play and sing as well as some minstrels.You
love to be charitable, I have enough to give, and enough to keep, as
large a daily alms as a deacon gives would never be missed by me.Your
father gets old for daily toil; he would live with us, as I should truly
hold him for my father also.I would be as chary of mixing in causeless
strife as of thrusting my hand into my own furnace; and if there came
on us unlawful violence, its wares would be brought to an ill chosen
market.""May you experience all the domestic happiness which you can conceive,
Henry, but with some one more happy than I am!"So spoke, or rather so sobbed, the Fair Maiden of Perth, who seemed
choking in the attempt to restrain her tears."It is cruel to ask what it cannot avail you to know."Yon wildcat, Conachar, perhaps?""I have marked his
looks--"

"You avail yourself of this painful situation to insult me, Henry,
though I have little deserved it.Conachar is nothing to me, more than
the trying to tame his wild spirit by instruction might lead me to
take some interest in a mind abandoned to prejudices and passions, and
therein, Henry, not unlike your own.""It must then be some of these flaunting silkworm sirs about the
court," said the armourer, his natural heat of temper kindling from
disappointment and vexation--"some of those who think they carry it
off through the height of their plumed bonnets and the jingle of their
spurs.I would I knew which it was that, leaving his natural mates, the
painted and perfumed dames of the court, comes to take his prey among
the simple maidens of the burgher craft.I would I knew but his name and
surname!""Henry Smith," said Catharine, shaking off the weakness which seemed to
threaten to overpower her a moment before, "this is the language of an
ungrateful fool, or rather of a frantic madman.I have told you already,
there was no one who stood, at the beginning of this conference, more
high in my opinion than he who is now losing ground with every word he
utters in the tone of unjust suspicion and senseless anger.You had no
title to know even what I have told you, which, I pray you to observe,
implies no preference to you over others, though it disowns any
preference of another to you.It is enough you should be aware that
there is as insuperable an objection to what you desire as if an
enchanter had a spell over my destiny.""Spells may be broken by true men," said, the smith."I would it were
come to that.Thorbiorn, the Danish armourer, spoke of a spell he had
for making breastplates, by singing a certain song while the iron was
heating.I told him that his runic rhymes were no proof against the
weapons which fought at Loncarty--what farther came of it it is needless
to tell, but the corselet and the wearer, and the leech who salved his
wound, know if Henry Gow can break a spell or no."Catharine looked at him as if about to return an answer little approving
of the exploit he had vaunted, which the downright smith had not
recollected was of a kind that exposed him to her frequent censure.But
ere she had given words to her thoughts, her father thrust his head in
at the door."Henry," he said, "I must interrupt your more pleasing affairs, and
request you to come into my working room in all speed, to consult about
certain matters deeply affecting the weal of the burgh."Henry, making his obeisance to Catharine, left the apartment upon her
father's summons.Indeed, it was probably in favour of their future
friendly intercourse, that they were parted on this occasion at the
turn which the conversation seemed likely to take.For, as the wooer
had begun to hold the refusal of the damsel as somewhat capricious and
inexplicable after the degree of encouragement which, in his opinion,
she had afforded; Catharine, on the other hand, considered him rather
as an encroacher upon the grace which she had shown him than one whose
delicacy rendered him deserving of such favour.But there was living
in their bosoms towards each other a reciprocal kindness, which, on the
termination of the dispute, was sure to revive, inducing the maiden
to forget her offended delicacy, and the lover his slighted warmth of
passion.Part I.


The conclave of citizens appointed to meet for investigating the affray
of the preceding evening had now assembled.The workroom of Simon Glover
was filled to crowding by personages of no little consequence, some of
whom wore black velvet cloaks, and gold chains around their necks.They were, indeed, the fathers of the city; and there were bailies and
deacons in the honoured number.There was an ireful and offended air of
importance upon every brow as they conversed together, rather in whisper
than aloud or in detail.Busiest among the busy, the little important
assistant of the previous night, Oliver Proudfute by name, and bonnet
maker by profession, was bustling among the crowd, much after the
manner of the seagull, which flutters, screams, and sputters most at the
commencement of a gale of wind, though one can hardly conceive what the
bird has better to do than to fly to its nest and remain quiet till the
gale is over.Be that as it may, Master Proudfute was in the midst of the crowd,
his fingers upon every one's button and his mouth in every man's ear,
embracing such as were near to his own stature, that he might more
closely and mysteriously utter his sentiments; and standing on tiptoe,
and supporting himself by the cloak collars of tall men, that he might
dole out to them also the same share of information.He felt himself one
of the heroes of the affair, being conscious of the dignity of superior
information on the subject as an eyewitness, and much disposed to push
his connexion with the scuffle a few points beyond the modesty of truth.It cannot be said that his communications were in especial curious and
important, consisting chiefly of such assertions as these:

"It is all true, by St.I was there and saw it myself--was the
first to run to the fray; and if it had not been for me and another
stout fellow, who came in about the same time, they had broken into
Simon Glover's house, cut his throat, and carried his daughter off
to the mountains.It is too evil usage--not to be suffered, neighbour
Crookshank; not to be endured, neighbour Glass; not to be borne,
neighbours Balneaves, Rollock, and Chrysteson.It was a mercy that I
and that stout fellow came in, was it not, neighbour and worthy Bailie
Craigdallie?"These speeches were dispersed by the busy bonnet maker into sundry ears.Bailie Craigdallie, a portly guild brother, the same who had advised the
prorogation of their civic council to the present place and hour, a big,
burly, good looking man, shook the deacon from his cloak with pretty
much the grace with which a large horse shrugs off the importunate
fly that has beset him for ten minutes, and exclaimed, "Silence, good
citizens; here comes Simon Glover, in whom no man ever saw falsehood.We
will hear the outrage from his own mouth."Simon being called upon to tell his tale, did so with obvious
embarrassment, which he imputed to a reluctance that the burgh should
be put in deadly feud with any one upon his account.It was, he dared to
say, a masking or revel on the part of the young gallants about court;
and the worst that might come of it would be, that he would put iron
stanchions on his daughter's window, in case of such another frolic."Why, then, if this was a mere masking or mummery," said Craigdallie,
"our townsman, Harry of the Wind, did far wrong to cut off a gentleman's
hand for such a harmless pleasantry, and the town may be brought to a
heavy fine for it, unless we secure the person of the mutilator.""Did you know what I do, you would
be as much afraid of handling this matter as if it were glowing iron.But, since you will needs put your fingers in the fire, truth must be
spoken.And come what will, I must say, that the matter might have ended
ill for me and mine, but for the opportune assistance of Henry Gow, the
armourer, well known to you all.""And mine also was not awanting," said Oliver Proudfute, "though I do
not profess to be utterly so good a swordsman as our neighbour Henry
Gow.You saw me, neighbour Glover, at the beginning of the fray?""I saw you after the end of it, neighbour," answered the glover, drily."True--true; I had forgot you were in your house while the blows were
going, and could not survey who were dealing them.""Peace, neighbour Proudfute--I prithee, peace," said Craigdallie, who
was obviously tired of the tuneless screeching of the worthy deacon."There is something mysterious here," said the bailie; "but I think I
spy the secret.Our friend Simon is, as you all know, a peaceful man,
and one that will rather sit down with wrong than put a friend, or say a
neighbourhood, in danger to seek his redress.Thou, Henry, who art never
wanting where the burgh needs a defender, tell us what thou knowest of
this matter."Our smith told his story to the same purpose which we have already
related; and the meddling maker of bonnets added as before, "And thou
sawest me there, honest smith, didst thou not?""Not I, in good faith, neighbour," answered Henry; "but you are a little
man, you know, and I might overlook you."This reply produced a laugh at Oliver's expense, who laughed for
company, but added doggedly, "I was one of the foremost to the rescue
for all that.""Why, where wert thou, then, neighbour?"said the smith; "for I saw you
not, and I would have given the worth of the best suit of armour I ever
wrought to have seen as stout a fellow as thou at my elbow.""I was no farther off, however, honest smith; and whilst thou wert
laying on blows as if on an anvil, I was parrying those that the rest of
the villains aimed at thee behind thy back; and that is the cause thou
sawest me not.""I have heard of smiths of old time who had but one eye," said Henry; "I
have two, but they are both set in my forehead, and so I could not see
behind my back, neighbour.""The truth is, however," persevered Master Oliver, "there I was, and I
will give Master Bailie my account of the matter; for the smith and I
were first up to the fray.""Enough at present," said the bailie, waving to Master Proudfute an
injunction of silence."The precognition of Simon Glover and Henry Gow
would bear out a matter less worthy of belief.And now, my masters,
your opinion what should be done.Here are all our burgher rights broken
through and insulted, and you may well fancy that it is by some man of
power, since no less dared have attempted such an outrage.My masters,
it is hard on flesh and blood to submit to this.The laws have framed us
of lower rank than the princes and nobles, yet it is against reason to
suppose that we will suffer our houses to be broken into, and the honour
of our women insulted, without some redress."Here Simon Glover interfered with a very anxious and ominous
countenance."I hope still that all was not meant so ill as it seemed
to us, my worthy neighbours; and I for one would cheerfully forgive the
alarm and disturbance to my poor house, providing the Fair City were not
brought into jeopardy for me.I beseech you to consider who are to be
our judges that are to hear the case, and give or refuse redress.I
speak among neighbours and friends, and therefore I speak openly.is so broken in mind and body, that he will but
turn us over to some great man amongst his counsellors who shall be in
favour for the time.Perchance he will refer us to his brother the Duke
of Albany, who will make our petition for righting of our wrongs the
pretence for squeezing money out of us.""We will none of Albany for our judge!"answered the meeting with the
same unanimity as before."Or perhaps," added Simon, "he will bid the Duke of Rothsay take charge
of it; and the wild young prince will regard the outrage as something
for his gay companions to scoff at, and his minstrels to turn into
song."he is too gay to be our judge," again exclaimed the
citizens.Simon, emboldened by seeing he was reaching the point he aimed at, yet
pronouncing the dreaded name with a half whisper, next added, "Would you
like the Black Douglas better to deal with?"They looked on each other with fallen
countenances and blanched lips.But Henry Smith spoke out boldly, and in a decided voice, the sentiments
which all felt, but none else dared give words to: "The Black Douglas to
judge betwixt a burgher and a gentleman, nay, a nobleman, for all I know
or care!You are mad, father Simon, so
much as to name so wild a proposal."There was again a silence of fear and uncertainty, which was at length
broken by Bailie Craigdallie, who, looking very significantly to the
speaker, replied, "You are confident in a stout doublet, neighbour
Smith, or you would not talk so boldly.""I am confident of a good heart under my doublet, such as it is,
bailie," answered the undaunted Henry; "and though I speak but little,
my mouth shall never be padlocked by any noble of them all.""Wear a thick doublet, good Henry, or do not speak so loud," reiterated
the bailie in the same significant tone."There are Border men in the
town who wear the bloody heart on their shoulder."Short rede, good rede," said the smith."Let us to our provost, and
demand his countenance and assistance."A murmur of applause went through the party, and Oliver Proudfute
exclaimed, "That is what I have been saying for this half hour, and not
one of ye would listen to me.'Let us go to our provost,' said I.'He is
a gentleman himself, and ought to come between the burgh and the nobles
in all matters.""Hush, neighbours--hush; be wary what you say or do," said a thin meagre
figure of a man, whose diminutive person seemed still more reduced in
size, and more assimilated to a shadow, by his efforts to assume an
extreme degree of humility, and make himself, to suit his argument, look
meaner yet, and yet more insignificant, than nature had made him."Pardon me," said he; "I am but a poor pottingar.Nevertheless, I have
been bred in Paris, and learned my humanities and my cursus medendi as
well as some that call themselves learned leeches.Methinks I can tent
this wound, and treat it with emollients.Here is our friend Simon
Glover, who is, as you all know, a man of worship.Think you he would
not be the most willing of us all to pursue harsh courses here, since
his family honour is so nearly concerned?And since he blenches away
from the charge against these same revellers, consider if he may not
have some good reason more than he cares to utter for letting the matter
sleep.It is not for me to put my finger on the sore; but, alack!we all
know that young maidens are what I call fugitive essences.Suppose now,
an honest maiden--I mean in all innocence--leaves her window unlatched
on St.Valentine's morn, that some gallant cavalier may--in all honesty,
I mean--become her Valentine for the season, and suppose the gallant
be discovered, may she not scream out as if the visit were unexpected,
and--and--bray all this in a mortar, and then consider, will it be a
matter to place the town in feud for?"The pottingar delivered his opinion in a most insinuating manner; but
he seemed to shrink into something less than his natural tenuity when he
saw the blood rise in the old cheek of Simon Glover, and inflame to the
temples the complexion of the redoubted smith.The last, stepping forward, and turning a stern look on the alarmed
pottingar, broke out as follows: "Thou walking skeleton!thou asthmatic
gallipot!if I thought that the puff of
vile breath thou hast left could blight for the tenth part of a minute
the fair fame of Catharine Glover, I would pound thee, quacksalver!in thine own mortar, and beat up thy wretched carrion with flower of
brimstone, the only real medicine in thy booth, to make a salve to rub
mangy hounds with!"cried the glover, in a tone of authority,
"no man has title to speak of this matter but me.Worshipful Bailie
Craigdallie, since such is the construction that is put upon my
patience, I am willing to pursue this riot to the uttermost; and though
the issue may prove that we had better have been patient, you will
all see that my Catharine hath not by any lightness or folly of hers
afforded grounds for this great scandal.""Neighbour Henry," said he, "we came here to
consult, and not to quarrel.As one of the fathers of the Fair City, I
command thee to forego all evil will and maltalent you may have against
Master Pottingar Dwining.""He is too poor a creature, bailie," said Henry Gow, "for me to harbour
feud with--I that could destroy him and his booth with one blow of my
forehammer.""Peace, then, and hear me," said the official."We all are as much
believers in the honour of the Fair Maiden of Perth as in that of our
Blessed Lady.""But touching our
appeal to our provost, are you agreed, neighbours, to put matter like
this into our provost's hand, being against a powerful noble, as is to
be feared?""The provost being himself a nobleman," squeaked the pottingar, in some
measure released from his terror by the intervention of the bailie."God knows, I speak not to the disparagement of an honourable gentleman,
whose forebears have held the office he now holds for many years--"

"By free choice of the citizens of Perth," said the smith, interrupting
the speaker with the tones of his deep and decisive voice."Ay, surely," said the disconcerted orator, "by the voice of the
citizens.I pray you, friend Smith, interrupt me not.I speak
to our worthy and eldest bailie, Craigdallie, according to my poor
mind.I say that, come amongst us how he will, still this Sir Patrick
Charteris is a nobleman, and hawks will not pick hawks' eyes out.He may
well bear us out in a feud with the Highlandmen, and do the part of our
provost and leader against them; but whether he that himself wears silk
will take our part against broidered cloak and cloth of gold, though
he may do so against tartan and Irish frieze, is something to be
questioned.We have saved our Maiden, of whom
I never meant to speak harm, as truly I knew none.They have lost one
man's hand, at least, thanks to Harry Smith--"

"And to me," added the little important bonnet maker."And to Oliver Proudfute, as he tells us," continued the pottingar, who
contested no man's claim to glory provided he was not himself compelled
to tread the perilous paths which lead to it."I say, neighbours, since
they have left a hand as a pledge they will never come in Couvrefew
Street again, why, in my simple mind, we were best to thank our stout
townsman, and the town having the honour and these rakehells the loss,
that we should hush the matter up and say no more about it."These pacific counsels had their effect with some of the citizens,
who began to nod and look exceedingly wise upon the advocate of
acquiescence, with whom, notwithstanding the offence so lately given,
Simon Glover seemed also to agree in opinion.But not so Henry Smith,
who, seeing the consultation at a stand, took up the speech in his usual
downright manner."I am neither the oldest nor the richest among you, neighbours, and I am
not sorry for it.Years will come, if one lives to see them; and I can
win and spend my penny like another, by the blaze of the furnace and the
wind of the bellows.But no man ever saw me sit down with wrong done
in word or deed to our fair town, if man's tongue and man's hand could
right it.Neither will I sit down with this outrage, if I can help it.I will go to the provost myself, if no one will go with me; he is a
knight, it is true, and a gentleman of free and true born blood, as we
all know, since Wallace's time, who settled his great grandsire amongst
us.But if he were the proudest nobleman in the land, he is the Provost
of Perth, and for his own honour must see the freedoms and immunities of
the burgh preserved--ay, and I know he will.I have made a steel doublet
for him, and have a good guess at the kind of heart that it was meant to
cover.""Surely," said Bailie Craigdallie, "it would be to no purpose to stir
at court without Sir Patrick Charteris's countenance: the ready answer
would be, 'Go to your provost, you borrel loons.'So, neighbours and
townsmen, if you will stand by my side, I and our pottingar Dwining
will repair presently to Kinfauns, with Sim Glover, the jolly smith, and
gallant Oliver Proudfute, for witnesses to the onslaught, and speak with
Sir Patrick Charteris, in name of the fair town.""Nay," said the peaceful man of medicine, "leave me behind, I pray you:
I lack audacity to speak before a belted knight.""Never regard that, neighbour, you must go," said Bailie Craigdallie."The town hold me a hot headed carle for a man of threescore; Sim Glover
is the offended party; we all know that Harry Gow spoils more harness
with his sword than he makes with his hammer and our neighbour
Proudfute, who, take his own word, is at the beginning and end of every
fray in Perth, is of course a man of action.We must have at least one
advocate amongst us for peace and quietness; and thou, pottingar, must
be the man.Away with you, sirs, get your boots and your beasts--horse
and hattock, I say, and let us meet at the East Port; that is, if it is
your pleasure, neighbours, to trust us with the matter.""There can be no better rede, and we will all avouch it," said the
citizens."If the provost take our part, as the Fair Town hath a right
to expect, we may bell the cat with the best of them.""It is well, then, neighbours," answered the bailie; "so said, so shall
be done.Meanwhile, I have called the whole town council together about
this hour, and I have little doubt," looking around the company, "that,
as so many of them who are in this place have resolved to consult with
our provost, the rest will be compliant to the same resolution.And,
therefore, neighbours, and good burghers of the Fair City of Perth,
horse and hattock, as I said before, and meet me at the East Port."A general acclamation concluded the sitting of this species of privy
council, or Lords of the Articles; and they dispersed, the deputation to
prepare for the journey, and the rest to tell their impatient wives and
daughters of the measures they had taken to render their chambers safe
in future against the intrusion of gallants at unseasonable hours.While nags are saddling, and the town council debating, or rather
putting in form what the leading members of their body had already
adopted, it may be necessary, for the information of some readers,
to state in distinct terms what is more circuitously intimated in the
course of the former discussion.It was the custom at this period, when the strength of the feudal
aristocracy controlled the rights, and frequently insulted the
privileges, of the royal burghs of Scotland, that the latter, where it
was practicable, often chose their provost, or chief magistrate, not out
of the order of the merchants, shopkeepers, and citizens, who inhabited
the town itself, and filled up the roll of the ordinary magistracy, but
elected to that preeminent state some powerful nobleman, or baron, in
the neighbourhood of the burgh, who was expected to stand their friend
at court in such matters as concerned their common weal, and to lead
their civil militia to fight, whether in general battle or in private
feud, reinforcing them with his own feudal retainers.The provosts sometimes availed themselves of
their situation to an unjustifiable degree, and obtained grants of lands
and tenements belonging to the common good, or public property of the
burgh, and thus made the citizens pay dear for the countenance which
they afforded.Others were satisfied to receive the powerful aid of the
townsmen in their own feudal quarrels, with such other marks of respect
and benevolence as the burgh over which they presided were willing to
gratify them with, in order to secure their active services in case of
necessity.The baron, who was the regular protector of a royal burgh,
accepted such freewill offerings without scruple, and repaid them by
defending the rights of the town by arguments in the council and by bold
deeds in the field.The citizens of the town, or, as they loved better to call it, the
Fair City, of Perth, had for several generations found a protector
and provost of this kind in the knightly family of Charteris, Lords of
Kinfauns, in the neighbourhood of the burgh.It was scarce a century (in
the time of Robert III) since the first of this distinguished family
had settled in the strong castle which now belonged to them, with the
picturesque and fertile scenes adjoining to it.But the history of the
first settler, chivalrous and romantic in itself, was calculated to
facilitate the settlement of an alien in the land in which his lot was
cast.We relate it as it is given by an ancient and uniform tradition,
which carries in it great indications of truth, and is warrant enough,
perhaps, for it insertion in graver histories than the present.During the brief career of the celebrated patriot Sir William Wallace,
and when his arms had for a time expelled the English invaders from his
native country, he is said to have undertaken a voyage to France, with
a small band of trusty friends, to try what his presence (for he was
respected through all countries for his prowess) might do to induce the
French monarch to send to Scotland a body of auxiliary forces, or other
assistance, to aid the Scots in regaining their independence.The Scottish Champion was on board a small vessel, and steering for the
port of Dieppe, when a sail appeared in the distance, which the mariners
regarded, first with doubt and apprehension, and at last with confusion
and dismay.Wallace demanded to know what was the cause of their alarm.The captain of the ship informed him that the tall vessel which was
bearing down, with the purpose of boarding that which he commanded, was
the ship of a celebrated rover, equally famed for his courage, strength
of body, and successful piracies.It was commanded by a gentleman named
Thomas de Longueville, a Frenchman by birth, but by practice one of
those pirates who called themselves friends to the sea and enemies to
all who sailed upon that element.He attacked and plundered vessels
of all nations, like one of the ancient Norse sea kings, as they were
termed, whose dominion was upon the mountain waves.The master added
that no vessel could escape the rover by flight, so speedy was the bark
he commanded; and that no crew, however hardy, could hope to resist him,
when, as was his usual mode of combat, he threw himself on board at the
head of his followers.Wallace smiled sternly, while the master of the ship, with alarm in his
countenance and tears in his eyes, described to him the certainty of
their being captured by the Red Rover, a name given to De Longueville,
because he usually displayed the blood red flag, which he had now
hoisted."I will clear the narrow seas of this rover," said Wallace.Then calling together some ten or twelve of his own followers, Boyd,
Kerlie, Seton, and others, to whom the dust of the most desperate battle
was like the breath of life, he commanded them to arm themselves,
and lie flat upon the deck, so as to be out of sight.He ordered the
mariners below, excepting such as were absolutely necessary to manage
the vessel; and he gave the master instructions, upon pain of death, so
to steer as that, while the vessel had an appearance of attempting to
fly, he should in fact permit the Red Rover to come up with them and do
his worst.Wallace himself then lay down on the deck, that nothing might
be seen which could intimate any purpose of resistance.In a quarter of
an hour De Longueville's vessel ran on board that of the Champion, and
the Red Rover, casting out grappling irons to make sure of his prize,
jumped on the deck in complete armour, followed by his men, who gave a
terrible shout, as if victory had been already secured.But the armed
Scots started up at once, and the rover found himself unexpectedly
engaged with men accustomed to consider victory as secure when they
were only opposed as one to two or three.Wallace himself rushed on the
pirate captain, and a dreadful strife began betwixt them with such fury
that the others suspended their own battle to look on, and seemed by
common consent to refer the issue of the strife to the fate of the
combat between the two chiefs.The pirate fought as well as man could
do; but Wallace's strength was beyond that of ordinary mortals.He
dashed the sword from the rover's hand, and placed him in such peril
that, to avoid being cut down, he was fain to close with the Scottish
Champion in hopes of overpowering him in the grapple.They fell on the deck, locked in each other's arms, but the
Frenchman fell undermost; and Wallace, fixing his grasp upon his gorget,
compressed it so closely, notwithstanding it was made of the finest
steel, that the blood gushed from his eyes, nose, and month, and he was
only able to ask for quarter by signs.His men threw down their weapons
and begged for mercy when they saw their leader thus severely handled.The victor granted them all their lives, but took possession of their
vessel, and detained them prisoners.When he came in sight of the French harbour, Wallace alarmed the place
by displaying the rover's colours, as if De Longueville was coming to
pillage the town.The bells were rung backward, horns were blown, and
the citizens were hurrying to arms, when the scene changed.The Scottish
Lion on his shield of gold was raised above the piratical flag, and
announced that the Champion of Scotland was approaching, like a falcon
with his prey in his clutch.He landed with his prisoner, and carried
him to the court of France, where, at Wallace's request, the robberies
which the pirate had committed were forgiven, and the king even
conferred the honour of knighthood on Sir Thomas de Longueville, and
offered to take him into his service.But the rover had contracted such
a friendship for his generous victor, that he insisted on uniting his
fortunes with those of Wallace, with whom he returned to Scotland, and
fought by his side in many a bloody battle, where the prowess of Sir
Thomas de Longueville was remarked as inferior to that of none, save of
his heroic conqueror.His fate also was more fortunate than that of his
patron.Being distinguished by the beauty as well as strength of his
person, he rendered himself so acceptable to a young lady, heiress of
the ancient family of Charteris, that she chose him for her husband,
bestowing on him with her hand the fair baronial Castle of Kinfauns, and
the domains annexed to it.Their descendants took the name of Charteris,
as connecting themselves with their maternal ancestors, the ancient
proprietors of the property, though the name of Thomas de Longueville
was equally honoured amongst them; and the large two handed sword with
which he mowed the ranks of war was, and is still, preserved among
the family muniments.Another account is, that the family name of De
Longueville himself was Charteris.The estate afterwards passed to a
family of Blairs, and is now the property of Lord Gray.These barons of Kinfauns, from father to son, held, for several
generations, the office of Provost of Perth, the vicinity of the castle
and town rendering it a very convenient arrangement for mutual support.The Sir Patrick of this history had more than once led out the men of
Perth to battles and skirmishes with the restless Highland depredators,
and with other enemies, foreign and domestic.True it is, he
used sometimes to be weary of the slight and frivolous complaints
unnecessarily brought before him, and in which he was requested to
interest himself.Hence he had sometimes incurred the charge of being
too proud as a nobleman, or too indolent as a man of wealth, and one who
was too much addicted to the pleasures of the field and the exercise of
feudal hospitality, to bestir himself upon all and every occasion
when the Fair Town would have desired his active interference.But,
notwithstanding that this occasioned some slight murmuring, the
citizens, upon any serious cause of alarm, were wont to rally around
their provost, and were warmly supported by him both in council and
action.Within the bounds of Annandale
     The gentle Johnstones ride;
     They have been there a thousand years,
     A thousand more they'll bide.The character and quality of Sir Patrick Charteris, the Provost of
Perth, being such as we have sketched in the last chapter, let us now
return to the deputation which was in the act of rendezvousing at the
East Port, in order to wait upon that dignitary with their complaints at
Kinfauns.And first appeared Simon Glover, on a pacing palfrey, which had
sometimes enjoyed the honour of bearing the fairer person as well as the
lighter weight of his beautiful daughter.His cloak was muffled round
the lower part of his face, as a sign to his friends not to interrupt
him by any questions while he passed through the streets, and partly,
perhaps, on account of the coldness of the weather.The deepest anxiety
was seated on his brow, as if the more he meditated on the matter he was
engaged in, the more difficult and perilous it appeared.He only greeted
by silent gestures his friends as they came to the rendezvous.A strong black horse, of the old Galloway breed, of an under size, and
not exceeding fourteen hands, but high shouldered, strong limbed, well
coupled, and round barrelled, bore to the East Port the gallant smith.A
judge of the animal might see in his eye a spark of that vicious temper
which is frequently the accompaniment of the form that is most vigorous
and enduring; but the weight, the hand, and the seat of the rider,
added to the late regular exercise of a long journey, had subdued his
stubbornness for the present.He was accompanied by the honest bonnet
maker, who being, as the reader is aware, a little round man, and
what is vulgarly called duck legged, had planted himself like a red
pincushion (for he was wrapped in a scarlet cloak, over which he had
slung a hawking pouch), on the top of a great saddle, which he might be
said rather to be perched upon than to bestride.The saddle and the man
were girthed on the ridge bone of a great trampling Flemish mare, with
a nose turned up in the air like a camel, a huge fleece of hair at each
foot, and every hoof full as large in circumference as a frying pan.The
contrast between the beast and the rider was so extremely extraordinary,
that, whilst chance passengers contented themselves with wondering how
he got up, his friends were anticipating with sorrow the perils which
must attend his coming down again; for the high seated horseman's
feet did not by any means come beneath the laps of the saddle.He had
associated himself to the smith, whose motions he had watched for the
purpose of joining him; for it was Oliver Proudfute's opinion that men
of action showed to most advantage when beside each other; and he was
delighted when some wag of the lower class had gravity enough to cry
out, without laughing outright: "There goes the pride of Perth--there go
the slashing craftsmen, the jolly Smith of the Wynd and the bold bonnet
maker!"It is true, the fellow who gave this all hail thrust his tongue in his
cheek to some scapegraces like himself; but as the bonnet maker did not
see this byplay, he generously threw him a silver penny to encourage
his respect for martialists.This munificence occasioned their being
followed by a crowd of boys, laughing and hallooing, until Henry Smith,
turning back, threatened to switch the foremost of them--a resolution
which they did not wait to see put in execution."Here are we the witnesses," said the little man on the large horse,
as they joined Simon Glover at the East Port; "but where are they that
should back us?authority is a load for an ass rather
than a spirited horse: it would but clog the motions of such young
fellows as you and me.""I could well wish to see you bear ever so little of that same weight,
worthy Master Proudfute," replied Henry Gow, "were it but to keep you
firm in the saddle; for you bounce aloft as if you were dancing a jig on
your seat, without any help from your legs.""Ay--ay; I raise myself in my stirrups to avoid the jolting.She is
cruelly hard set this mare of mine; but she has carried me in field
and forest, and through some passages that were something perilous,
so Jezabel and I part not.I call her Jezabel, after the Princess of
Castile.""Isabel, I suppose you mean," answered the smith."Ay--Isabel, or Jezabel--all the same, you know.But here comes Bailie
Craigdallie at last, with that poor, creeping, cowardly creature the
pottingar.They have brought two town officers with their partizans, to
guard their fair persons, I suppose.If there is one thing I hate more
than another, it is such a sneaking varlet as that Dwining.""Have a care he does not hear you say so," said the smith, "I tell thee,
bonnet maker, that there is more danger in yonder slight wasted anatomy
than in twenty stout fellows like yourself."Bully Smith, you are but jesting with me," said Oliver,
softening his voice, however, and looking towards the pottingar, as if
to discover in what limb or lineament of his wasted face and form lay
any appearance of the menaced danger; and his examination reassuring
him, he answered boldly: "Blades and bucklers, man, I would stand the
feud of a dozen such as Dwining.What could he do to any man with blood
in his veins?""He could give him a dose of physic," answered the smith drily.They had no time for further colloquy, for Bailie Craigdallie called to
them to take the road to Kinfauns, and himself showed the example.As
they advanced at a leisurely pace, the discourse turned on the reception
which they were to expect from their provost, and the interest which
he was likely to take in the aggression which they complained of.The
glover seemed particularly desponding, and talked more than once in
a manner which implied a wish that they would yet consent to let the
matter rest.He did not speak out very plainly, however, fearful,
perhaps, of the malignant interpretation which might be derived from
any appearance of his flinching from the assertion of his daughter's
reputation.Dwining seemed to agree with him in opinion, but spoke more
cautiously than in the morning."After all," said the bailie, "when I think of all the propines and
good gifts which have passed from the good town to my Lord Provost's,
I cannot think he will be backward to show himself.More than one lusty
boat, laden with Bordeaux wine, has left the South Shore to discharge
its burden under the Castle of Kinfauns.I have some right to speak of
that, who was the merchant importer.""And," said Dwining, with his squeaking voice, "I could speak of
delicate confections, curious comfits, loaves of wastel bread, and even
cakes of that rare and delicious condiment which men call sugar, that
have gone thither to help out a bridal banquet, or a kirstening feast,
or suchlike.But, alack, Bailie Craigdallie, wine is drunk, comfits are
eaten, and the gift is forgotten when the flavour is past away.neighbour, the banquet of last Christmas is gone like the last year's
snow.""But there have been gloves full of gold pieces," said the magistrate."I should know that who wrought them," said Simon, whose professional
recollections still mingled with whatever else might occupy his mind."One was a hawking glove for my lady.Her
ladyship found no fault, in consideration of the intended lining.""Well, go to," said Bailie Craigdallie, "the less I lie; and if these
are not to the fore, it is the provost's fault, and not the town's: they
could neither be eat nor drunk in the shape in which he got them.""I could speak of a brave armour too," said the smith; "but, cogan na
schie!as John Highlandman says--I think the
knight of Kinfauns will do his devoir by the burgh in peace or war; and
it is needless to be reckoning the town's good deeds till we see him
thankless for them.""So say I," cried our friend Proudfute, from the top of his mare."We
roystering blades never bear so base a mind as to count for wine and
walnuts with a friend like Sir Patrick Charteris.Nay, trust me, a good
woodsman like Sir Patrick will prize the right of hunting and sporting
over the lands of the burgh as an high privilege, and one which, his
Majesty the King's Grace excepted, is neither granted to lord nor loon
save to our provost alone."As the bonnet maker spoke, there was heard on the left hand the cry of,
"So so--waw waw--haw," being the shout of a falconer to his hawk."Methinks yonder is a fellow using the privilege you mention, who, from
his appearance, is neither king nor provost," said the smith."Ay, marry, I see him," said the bonnet maker, who imagined the occasion
presented a prime opportunity to win honour."Thou and I, jolly smith,
will prick towards him and put him to the question.""Have with you, then," cried the smith; and his companion spurred his
mare and went off, never doubting that Gow was at his heels.But Craigdallie caught Henry's horse by the reins."Stand fast by the
standard," he said; "let us see the luck of our light horseman.If he
procures himself a broken pate he will be quieter for the rest of the
day.""From what I already see," said the smith, "he may easily come by such
a boon.Yonder fellow, who stops so impudently to look at us, as if he
were engaged in the most lawful sport in the world--I guess him, by his
trotting hobbler, his rusty head piece with the cock's feather, and long
two handed sword, to be the follower of some of the southland lords--men
who live so near the Southron, that the black jack is never off their
backs, and who are as free of their blows as they are light in their
fingers."Whilst they were thus speculating on the issue of the rencounter the
valiant bonnet maker began to pull up Jezabel, in order that the smith,
who he still concluded was close behind, might overtake him, and either
advance first or at least abreast of himself.But when he saw him at a
hundred yards distance, standing composedly with the rest of the group,
the flesh of the champion, like that of the old Spanish general, began
to tremble, in anticipation of the dangers into which his own venturous
spirit was about to involve it.Yet the consciousness of being
countenanced by the neighbourhood of so many friends, the hopes that
the appearance of such odds must intimidate the single intruder, and the
shame of abandoning an enterprise in which he had volunteered, and
when so many persons must witness his disgrace, surmounted the strong
inclination which prompted him to wheel Jezabel to the right about, and
return to the friends whose protection he had quitted, as fast as her
legs could carry them.He accordingly continued his direction towards
the stranger, who increased his alarm considerably by putting his little
nag in motion, and riding to meet him at a brisk trot.On observing this
apparently offensive movement, our hero looked over his left shoulder
more than once, as if reconnoitring the ground for a retreat, and in the
mean while came to a decided halt.But the Philistine was upon him
ere the bonnet maker could decide whether to fight or fly, and a very
ominous looking Philistine he was.His figure was gaunt and lathy, his
visage marked by two or three ill favoured scars, and the whole man had
much the air of one accustomed to say, "Stand and deliver," to a true
man.This individual began the discourse by exclaiming, in tones as sinister
as his looks, "The devil catch you for a cuckoo, why do you ride across
the moor to spoil my sport?""Worthy stranger," said our friend, in the tone of pacific remonstrance,
"I am Oliver Proudfute, a burgess of Perth, and a man of substance;
and yonder is the worshipful Adam Craigdallie, the oldest bailie of the
burgh, with the fighting Smith of the Wynd, and three or four armed
men more, who desire to know your name, and how you come to take your
pleasure over these lands belonging to the burgh of Perth; although,
natheless, I will answer for them, it is not their wish to quarrel with
a gentleman, or stranger for any accidental trespass; only it is
their use and wont not to grant such leave, unless it is duly asked;
and--and--therefore I desire to know your name, worthy sir."The grim and loathly aspect with which the falconer had regarded
Oliver Proudfute during his harangue had greatly disconcerted him, and
altogether altered the character of the inquiry which, with Henry Gow to
back him, he would probably have thought most fitting for the occasion.The stranger replied to it, modified as it was, with a most inauspicious
grin, which the scars of his visage made appear still more repulsive.My name is the Devil's Dick of Hellgarth,
well known in Annandale for a gentle Johnstone.I follow the stout Laird
of Wamphray, who rides with his kinsman the redoubted Lord of Johnstone,
who is banded with the doughty Earl of Douglas; and the earl and the
lord, and the laird and I, the esquire, fly our hawks where we find our
game, and ask no man whose ground we ride over.""I will do your message, sir," replied Oliver Proudfute, meekly enough;
for he began to be very desirous to get free of the embassy which he had
so rashly undertaken, and was in the act of turning his horse's head,
when the Annandale man added:

"And take you this to boot, to keep you in mind that you met the Devil's
Dick, and to teach you another time to beware how you spoil the sport of
any one who wears the flying spur on his shoulder."With these words he applied two or three smart blows of his riding rod
upon the luckless bonnet maker's head and person.Some of them lighted
upon Jezabel, who, turning sharply round, laid her rider upon the moor,
and galloped back towards the party of citizens.Proudfute, thus overthrown, began to cry for assistance in no very
manly voice, and almost in the same breath to whimper for mercy; for his
antagonist, dismounting almost as soon as he fell, offered a whinger,
or large wood knife, to his throat, while he rifled the pockets of the
unlucky citizen, and even examined his hawking bag, swearing two or
three grisly oaths, that he would have what it contained, since the
wearer had interrupted his sport.He pulled the belt rudely off,
terrifying the prostrate bonnet maker still more by the regardless
violence which he used, as, instead of taking the pains to unbuckle the
strap, he drew till the fastening gave way.But apparently it contained
nothing to his mind.He threw it carelessly from him, and at the
same time suffered the dismounted cavalier to rise, while he himself
remounted his hobbler, and looked towards the rest of Oliver's party,
who were now advancing.When they had seen their delegate overthrown, there was some laughter;
so much had the vaunting humor of the bonnet maker prepared his friends
to rejoice when, as Henry Smith termed it, they saw the Oliver meet with
a Rowland.But when the bonnet maker's adversary was seen to bestride
him, and handle him in the manner described, the armourer could hold out
no longer."Please you, good Master Bailie, I cannot endure to see our townsman
beaten and rifled, and like to be murdered before us all.It reflects
upon the Fair Town, and if it is neighbour Proudfute's misfortune, it is
our shame."We will all go to his rescue," answered Bailie Craigdallie; "but let no
man strike without order from me.We have more feuds on our hands, it is
to be feared, than we have strength to bring to good end.And therefore
I charge you all, more especially you, Henry of the Wynd, in the name of
the Fair City, that you make no stroke but in self defence."They all advanced, therefore, in a body; and the appearance of such a
number drove the plunderer from his booty.He stood at gaze, however, at
some distance, like the wolf, which, though it retreats before the dogs,
cannot be brought to absolute flight.Henry, seeing this state of things, spurred his horse and advanced far
before the rest of the party, up towards the scene of Oliver Proudfute's
misfortune.His first task was to catch Jezabel by the flowing rein, and
his next to lead her to meet her discomfited master, who was crippling
towards him, his clothes much soiled with his fall, his eyes streaming
with tears, from pain as well as mortification, and altogether
exhibiting an aspect so unlike the spruce and dapper importance of
his ordinary appearance, that the honest smith felt compassion for
the little man, and some remorse at having left him exposed to such
disgrace.All men, I believe, enjoy an ill natured joke.The difference
is, that an ill natured person can drink out to the very dregs the
amusement which it affords, while the better moulded mind soon loses the
sense of the ridiculous in sympathy for the pain of the sufferer."Let me pitch you up to your saddle again, neighbour," said the smith,
dismounting at the same time, and assisting Oliver to scramble into his
war saddle, as a monkey might have done."May God forgive you, neighbour Smith, for not backing of me!I would
not have believed in it, though fifty credible witnesses had sworn it of
you."Such were the first words, spoken in sorrow more than anger, by which
the dismayed Oliver vented his feelings."The bailie kept hold of my horse by the bridle; and besides," Henry
continued, with a smile, which even his compassion could not suppress,
"I thought you would have accused me of diminishing your honour, if I
brought you aid against a single man.the villain took
foul odds of you, your horse not being well at command.""That is true--that is true," said Oliver, eagerly catching at the
apology."And yonder stands the faitour, rejoicing at the mischief he has done,
and triumphing in your overthrow, like the king in the romance, who
played upon the fiddle whilst a city was burning.Come thou with me, and
thou shalt see how we will handle him.Nay, fear not that I will desert
thee this time."So saying, he caught Jezabel by the rein, and galloping alongside of
her, without giving Oliver time to express a negative, he rushed towards
the Devil's Dick, who had halted on the top of a rising ground at some
distance.The gentle Johnstone, however, either that he thought the
contest unequal, or that he had fought enough for the day, snapping his
fingers and throwing his hand out with an air of defiance, spurred his
horse into a neighbouring bog, through which he seemed to flutter like
a wild duck, swinging his lure round his head, and whistling to his hawk
all the while, though any other horse and rider must have been instantly
bogged up to the saddle girths."There goes a thoroughbred moss trooper," said the smith."That fellow
will fight or flee as suits his humor, and there is no use to pursue
him, any more than to hunt a wild goose.He has got your purse, I doubt
me, for they seldom leave off till they are full handed.""Ye--ye--yes," said Proudfute, in a melancholy tone, "he has got my
purse; but there is less matter since he hath left the hawking bag.""Nay, the hawking bag had been an emblem of personal victory, to be
sure--a trophy, as the minstrels call it.""There is more in it than that, friend," said Oliver, significantly."Why, that is well, neighbour: I love to hear you speak in your own
scholarly tone again.Cheer up, you have seen the villain's back, and
regained the trophies you had lost when taken at advantage.""Ah, Henry Gow--Henry Gow--" said the bonnet maker, and stopped short
with a deep sigh, nearly amounting to a groan.asked his friend--"what is it you vex yourself
about now?""I have some suspicion, my dearest friend, Henry Smith, that the villain
fled for fear of you, not of me.""Do not think so," replied the armourer: "he saw two men and fled, and
who can tell whether he fled for one or the other?Besides, he knows
by experience your strength and activity: we all saw how you kicked and
struggled when you were on the ground.""I do not remember it, but I know it is my
best point: I am a strong dog in the loins."All as much as I," said the smith, smothering an inclination to
laughter."But thou wilt remind them of it?""Be assured I will," answered Henry, "and of thy desperate rally even
now.Mark what I say to Bailie Craigdallie, and make the best of it.""It is not that I require any evidence in thy favour, for I am as brave
by nature as most men in Perth; but only--" Here the man of valour
paused."But only I am afraid of being killed.To leave my pretty wife and my
young family, you know, would be a sad change, Smith.You will know this
when it is your own case, and will feel abated in courage.""It is like that I may," said the armourer, musing."Then I am so accustomed to the use of arms, and so well breathed, that
few men can match me.It's all here," said the little man, expanding his
breast like a trussed fowl, and patting himself with his hands--"here is
room for all the wind machinery.""I dare say you are long breathed--long winded; at least your speech
bewrays--"

"My speech!You are a wag--But I have got the stern post of a dromond
brought up the river from Dundee."exclaimed the armourer; "conscience,
man, it will put you in feud with the whole clan--not the least wrathful
in the country, as I take it."I mean a dromond--that is, a large
ship.I have fixed this post in my yard, and had it painted and carved
something like a soldan or Saracen, and with him I breathe myself, and
will wield my two handed sword against him, thrust or point, for an hour
together.""That must make you familiar with the use of your weapon," said the
smith."Ay, marry does it; and sometimes I will place you a bonnet--an old one,
most likely--on my soldan's head, and cleave it with such a downright
blow that in troth, the infidel has but little of his skull remaining to
hit at.""That is unlucky, for you will lose your practice," said Henry."But how
say you, bonnet maker?I will put on my head piece and corselet one
day, and you shall hew at me, allowing me my broadsword to parry and pay
back?"By no manner of means, my dear friend.I should do you too much evil;
besides, to tell you the truth, I strike far more freely at a helmet or
bonnet when it is set on my wooden soldan; then I am sure to fetch it
down.But when there is a plume of feathers in it that nod, and two eyes
gleaming fiercely from under the shadow of the visor, and when the whole
is dancing about here and there, I acknowledge it puts out my hand of
fence.""So, if men would but stand stock still like your soldan, you would play
the tyrant with them, Master Proudfute?""In time, and with practice, I conclude I might," answered Oliver."But
here we come up with the rest of them.Bailie Craigdallie looks angry,
but it is not his kind of anger that frightens me."You are to recollect, gentle reader, that as soon as the bailie and
those who attended him saw that the smith had come up to the forlorn
bonnet maker, and that the stranger had retreated, they gave themselves
no trouble about advancing further to his assistance, which they
regarded as quite ensured by the presence of the redoubted Henry Gow.They had resumed their straight road to Kinfauns, desirous that nothing
should delay the execution of their mission.As some time had
elapsed ere the bonnet maker and the smith rejoined the party, Bailie
Craigdallie asked them, and Henry Smith in particular, what they meant
by dallying away precious time by riding uphill after the falconer."By the mass, it was not my fault, Master Bailie," replied the smith."If ye will couple up an ordinary Low Country greyhound with a Highland
wolf dog, you must not blame the first of them for taking the direction
in which it pleases the last to drag him on.It was so, and not
otherwise, with my neighbour Oliver Proudfute.He no sooner got up from
the ground, but he mounted his mare like a flash of lightning, and,
enraged at the unknightly advantage which yonder rascal had taken of
his stumbling horse, he flew after him like a dromedary.I could not but
follow, both to prevent a second stumble and secure our over bold friend
and champion from the chance of some ambush at the top of the hill.But
the villain, who is a follower of some Lord of the Marches, and wears a
winged spur for his cognizance, fled from our neighbour like fire from
flint."The senior bailie of Perth listened with surprise to the legend which
it had pleased Gow to circulate; for, though not much caring for the
matter, he had always doubted the bonnet maker's romancing account
of his own exploits, which hereafter he must hold as in some degree
orthodox.The shrewd old glover looked closer into the matter."You will drive the
poor bonnet maker mad," he whispered to Henry, "and set him a-ringing
his clapper as if he were a town bell on a rejoicing day, when for order
and decency it were better he were silent.""Oh, by Our Lady, father," replied the smith, "I love the poor little
braggadocio, and could not think of his sitting rueful and silent in
the provost's hall, while all the rest of them, and in especial that
venomous pottingar, were telling their mind.""Thou art even too good natured a fellow, Henry," answered Simon."But
mark the difference betwixt these two men.The harmless little bonnet
maker assumes the airs of a dragon, to disguise his natural cowardice;
while the pottingar wilfully desires to show himself timid, poor
spirited, and humble, to conceal the danger of his temper.The adder
is not the less deadly that he creeps under a stone.I tell thee, son
Henry, that, for all his sneaking looks and timorous talking, this
wretched anatomy loves mischief more than he fears danger.But here we
stand in front of the provost's castle; and a lordly place is Kinfauns,
and a credit to the city it is, to have the owner of such a gallant
castle for its chief magistrate.""A goodly fortalice, indeed," said the smith, looking at the broad
winding Tay, as it swept under the bank on which the castle stood, like
its modern successor, and seemed the queen of the valley, although, on
the opposite side of the river, the strong walls of Elcho appeared to
dispute the pre-eminence.Elcho, however, was in that age a peaceful
nunnery, and the walls with which it was surrounded were the barriers of
secluded vestals, not the bulwarks of an armed garrison."'Tis a brave castle," said the armourer, again looking at the towers
of Kinfauns, "and the breastplate and target of the bonny course of the
Tay.It were worth lipping a good blade, before wrong were offered to
it."The porter of Kinfauns, who knew from a distance the persons and
characters of the party, had already opened the courtyard gate for
their entrance, and sent notice to Sir Patrick Charteris that the eldest
bailie of Perth, with some other good citizens, were approaching the
castle.The good knight, who was getting ready for a hawking party,
heard the intimation with pretty much the same feelings that the modern
representative of a burgh hears of the menaced visitation of a party of
his worthy electors, at a time rather unseasonable for their reception.That is, he internally devoted the intruders to Mahound and Termagaunt,
and outwardly gave orders to receive them with all decorum and civility;
commanded the sewers to bring hot venison steaks and cold baked meats
into the knightly hall with all despatch, and the butler to broach his
casks, and do his duty; for if the Fair City of Perth sometimes filled
his cellar, her citizens were always equally ready to assist at emptying
his flagons.The good burghers were reverently marshalled into the hall, where the
knight, who was in a riding habit, and booted up to the middle of
his thighs, received them with a mixture of courtesy and patronising
condescension; wishing them all the while at the bottom of the Tay, on
account of the interruption their arrival gave to his proposed amusement
of the morning.He met them in the midst of the hall, with bare head and
bonnet in hand, and some such salutation as the following:

"Ha, my Master Eldest Bailie, and you, worthy Simon Glover, fathers of
the Fair City, and you, my learned pottingar, and you, stout smith, and
my slashing bonnet maker too, who cracks more skulls than he covers, how
come I to have the pleasure of seeing so many friends so early?I was
thinking to see my hawks fly, and your company will make the sport more
pleasant--(Aside, I trust in Our Lady they may break their necks!)--that
is, always, unless the city have any commands to lay on me.Butler
Gilbert, despatch, thou knave.But I hope you have no more grave errand
than to try if the malvoisie holds its flavour?"The city delegates answered to their provost's civilities by
inclinations and congees, more or less characteristic, of which the
pottingar's bow was the lowest and the smith's the least ceremonious.Probably he knew his own value as a fighting man upon occasion.To the
general compliment the elder bailie replied."Sir Patrick Charteris, and our noble Lord Provost," said Craigdallie,
gravely, "had our errand been to enjoy the hospitality with which we
have been often regaled here, our manners would have taught us to tarry
till your lordship had invited us, as on other occasions.And as to
hawking, we have had enough on't for one morning; since a wild fellow,
who was flying a falcon hard by on the moor, unhorsed and cudgelled our
worthy friend Oliver Bonnet Maker, or Proudfute, as some men call him,
merely because he questioned him, in your honour's name, and the town of
Perth's, who or what he was that took so much upon him."I
will teach him to forestall my sport!""So please your lordship," said the bonnet maker, "he did take me at
disadvantage.But I got on horseback again afterwards, and pricked after
him gallantly.he that the rhymes and romances are made on?""I thought that smaik's name had been Robert.""I trow they be different, my lord.I only graced this fellow with the
full title, for indeed he called himself the Devil's Dick, and said he
was a Johnstone, and a follower of the lord of that name.But I put him
back into the bog, and recovered my hawking bag, which he had taken when
I was at disadvantage.""We have heard," said he, "of the
Lord of Johnstone, and of his followers.Little is to be had by meddling
with them.Smith, tell me, did you endure this?""Ay, faith did I, Sir Patrick, having command from my betters not to
help.""Well, if thou satst down with it," said the provost, "I see not why we
should rise up; especially as Master Oliver Proudfute, though taken at
advantage at first, has, as he has told us; recovered his reputation and
that of the burgh.Fill round to my
good friends and guests till the wine leap over the cup.Johnston, and a merry welcome to you all, my honest friends!And
now sit you to eat a morsel, for the sun is high up, and it must be long
since you thrifty men have broken your fast.""Before we eat, my Lord Provost," said the bailie, "let us tell you the
pressing cause of our coming, which as yet we have not touched upon.""Nay, prithee, bailie," said the provost, "put it off till thou hast
eaten.Some complaint against the rascally jackmen and retainers of the
nobles, for playing at football on the streets of the burgh, or some
such goodly matter.""No, my lord," said Craigdallie, stoutly and firmly."It is the
jackmen's masters of whom we complain, for playing at football with the
honour of our families, and using as little ceremony with our daughters'
sleeping chambers as if they were in a bordel at Paris.A party of
reiving night walkers--courtiers and men of rank, as there is but too
much reason to believe--attempted to scale the windows of Simon Glover's
house last night; they stood in their defence with drawn weapons when
they were interrupted by Henry Smith, and fought till they were driven
off by the rising of the citizens."said Sir Patrick, setting down the cup which he was about to
raise to his head."Cock's body, make that manifest to me, and, by
the soul of Thomas of Longueville, I will see you righted with my best
power, were it to cost me life and land.Simon Glover,
you are held an honest and a cautious man--do you take the truth of this
charge upon your conscience?""My lord," said Simon, "understand I am no willing complainer in this
weighty matter.No damage has arisen, save to the breakers of the peace
themselves.I fear only great power could have encouraged such lawless
audacity; and I were unwilling to put feud between my native town and
some powerful nobleman on my account.But it has been said that, if I
hang back in prosecuting this complaint, it will be as much as admitting
that my daughter expected such a visit, which is a direct falsehood.Therefore, my lord, I will tell your lordship what happened, so far as I
know, and leave further proceeding to your wisdom."He then told, from point to point, all that he had seen of the attack.Sir Patrick Charteris, listening with much attention, seemed
particularly struck with the escape of the man who had been made
prisoner."Strange," he said, "that you did not secure him when you had him.Did
you not look at him so as to know him again?""I had but the light of a lantern, my Lord Provost; and as to suffering
him to escape, I was alone," said the glover, "and old.But yet I might
have kept him, had I not heard my daughter shriek in the upper room;
and ere I had returned from her chamber the man had escaped through the
garden.""Now, armourer, as a true man and a good soldier," said Sir Patrick,
"tell me what you know of this matter."Henry Gow, in his own decided style, gave a brief but clear narrative of
the whole affair.Honest Proudfute being next called upon, began his statement with an air
of more importance."Touching this awful and astounding tumult within
the burgh, I cannot altogether, it is true, say with Henry Gow that I
saw the very beginning.But it will not be denied that I beheld a great
part of the latter end, and especially that I procured the evidence most
effectual to convict the knaves.""Never lose time
fumbling and prating about it."I have brought your lordship, in this pouch, what one of the rogues
left behind him," said the little man."It is a trophy which, in good
faith and honest truth, I do confess I won not by the blade, but I
claim the credit of securing it with that presence of mind which few men
possess amidst flashing torches and clashing weapons.I secured it, my
lord, and here it is."So saying, he produced, from the hawking pouch already mentioned, the
stiffened hand which had been found on the scene of the skirmish."Nay, bonnet maker," said the provost, "I'll warrant thee man enough to
secure a rogue's hand after it is cut from the body.What do you look so
busily for in your bag?""There should have been--there was--a ring, my lord, which was on the
knave's finger.I fear I have been forgetful, and left it at home, for
I took it off to show to my wife, as she cared not to look upon the dead
hand, as women love not such sights.But yet I thought I had put it on
the finger again.Nevertheless, it must, I bethink me, be at home.I
will ride back for it, and Henry Smith will trot along with me.""We will all trot with thee," said Sir Patrick Charteris, "since I
am for Perth myself.Look you, honest burghers and good neighbours of
Perth; you may have thought me unapt to be moved by light complaints and
trivial breaches of your privileges, such as small trespasses on
your game, the barons' followers playing football in the street, and
suchlike.But, by the soul of Thomas of Longueville, you shall not find
Patrick Charteris slothful in a matter of this importance.This hand,"
he continued, holding up the severed joint, "belongs to one who hath
worked no drudgery.We will put it in a way to be known and claimed of
the owner, if his comrades of the revel have but one spark of honour in
them.Hark you, Gerard; get me some half score of good men instantly to
horse, and let them take jack and spear.Meanwhile, neighbours, if
feud arise out of this, as is most likely, we must come to each other's
support.If my poor house be attacked, how many men will you bring to my
support?"The burghers looked at Henry Gow, to whom they instinctively turned when
such matters were discussed."I will answer," said he, "for fifty good fellows to be assembled ere
the common bell has rung ten minutes; for a thousand, in the space of an
hour.""It is well," answered the gallant provost; "and in the case of need,
I will come to aid the Fair City with such men as I can make.And now,
good friends, let us to horse."If I know how to manage these affairs,
     Thus thrust disorderly upon my hands,
     Never believe me--

     Richard II.Valentine's Day that the prior of
the Dominicans was engaged in discharge of his duties as confessor to
a penitent of no small importance.This was an elderly man, of a goodly
presence, a florid and healthful cheek, the under part of which was
shaded by a venerable white beard, which descended over his bosom.The
large and clear blue eyes, with the broad expanse of brow, expressed
dignity; but it was of a character which seemed more accustomed to
receive honours voluntarily paid than to enforce them when they were
refused.The good nature of the expression was so great as to approach
to defenceless simplicity or weakness of character, unfit, it might
be inferred, to repel intrusion or subdue resistance.Amongst the grey
locks of this personage was placed a small circlet or coronet of gold,
upon a blue fillet.His beads, which were large and conspicuous, were of
native gold, rudely enough wrought, but ornamented with Scottish pearls
of rare size and beauty.These were his only ornaments; and a long
crimson robe of silk, tied by a sash of the same colour, formed his
attire.His shrift being finished, he arose heavily from the embroidered
cushion upon which he kneeled during his confession, and, by the
assistance of a crutch headed staff of ebony, moved, lame and
ungracefully, and with apparent pain, to a chair of state, which,
surmounted by a canopy, was placed for his accommodation by the chimney
of the lofty and large apartment.This was Robert, third of that name, and the second of the ill fated
family of Stuart who filled the throne of Scotland.He had many virtues,
and was not without talent; but it was his great misfortune that, like
others of his devoted line, his merits were not of a kind suited to the
part which he was called upon to perform in life.The king of so fierce
a people as the Scots then were ought to have been warlike, prompt, and
active, liberal in rewarding services, strict in punishing crimes, one
whose conduct should make him feared as well as beloved.The qualities
of Robert the Third were the reverse of all these.In youth he had
indeed seen battles; but, without incurring disgrace, he had never
manifested the chivalrous love of war and peril, or the eager desire to
distinguish himself by dangerous achievements, which that age expected
from all who were of noble birth and had claims to authority.Amidst the tumult of a
tournament, the young Earl of Carrick, such was then his title, received
a kick from the horse of Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith, in consequence
of which he was lame for the rest of his life, and absolutely disabled
from taking share either in warfare or in the military sports and
tournaments which were its image.As Robert had never testified much
predilection for violent exertion, he did not probably much regret
the incapacities which exempted him from these active scenes.But his
misfortune, or rather its consequences, lowered him in the eyes of
a fierce nobility and warlike people.He was obliged to repose the
principal charge of his affairs now in one member, now in another, of
his family, sometimes with the actual rank, and always with the power,
of lieutenant general of the kingdom.His paternal affection would have
induced him to use the assistance of his eldest son, a young man of
spirit and talent, whom in fondness he had created Duke of Rothsay, in
order to give him the present possession of a dignity next to that of
the throne.But the young prince's head was too giddy, and his hand
too feeble to wield with dignity the delegated sceptre.However fond of
power, pleasure was the Prince's favourite pursuit; and the court was
disturbed, and the country scandalised, by the number of fugitive amours
and extravagant revels practised by him who should have set an example
of order and regularity to the youth of the kingdom.The license and impropriety of the Duke of Rothsay's conduct was the
more reprehensible in the public view, that he was a married person;
although some, over whom his youth, gaiety, grace, and good temper had
obtained influence, were of opinion that an excuse for his libertinism
might be found in the circumstances of the marriage itself.They
reminded each other that his nuptials were entirely conducted by his
uncle, the Duke of Albany, by whose counsels the infirm and timid King
was much governed at the time, and who had the character of managing the
temper of his brother and sovereign, so as might be most injurious to
the interests and prospects of the young heir.By Albany's machinations
the hand of the heir apparent was in a manner put up to sale, as it was
understood publicly that the nobleman in Scotland who should give the
largest dower to his daughter might aspire to raise her to the bed of
the Duke of Rothsay.In the contest for preference which ensued, George Earl of Dunbar and
March, who possessed, by himself or his vassals, a great part of the
eastern frontier, was preferred to other competitors; and his daughter
was, with the mutual goodwill of the young couple, actually contracted
to the Duke of Rothsay.But there remained a third party to be consulted, and that was no other
than the tremendous Archibald Earl of Douglas, terrible alike from the
extent of his lands, from the numerous offices and jurisdictions with
which he was invested, and from his personal qualities of wisdom and
valour, mingled with indomitable pride, and more than the feudal love
of vengeance.The Earl was also nearly related to the throne, having
married the eldest daughter of the reigning monarch.After the espousals of the Duke of Rothsay with the Earl of March's
daughter, Douglas, as if he had postponed his share in the negotiation
to show that it could not be concluded with any one but himself, entered
the lists to break off the contract.He tendered a larger dower with his
daughter Marjory than the Earl of March had proffered; and, secured by
his own cupidity and fear of the Douglas, Albany exerted his influence
with the timid monarch till he was prevailed upon to break the contract
with the Earl of March, and wed his son to Marjory Douglas, a woman whom
Rothsay could not love.No apology was offered to the Earl of March,
excepting that the espousals betwixt the Prince and Elizabeth of Dunbar
had not been approved by the States of Parliament, and that till such
ratification the contract was liable to be broken off.The Earl deeply
resented the wrong done to himself and his daughter, and was generally
understood to study revenge, which his great influence on the English
frontier was likely to place within his power.In the mean time, the Duke of Rothsay, incensed at the sacrifice of his
hand and his inclinations to this state intrigue, took his own mode
of venting his displeasure, by neglecting his wife, contemning his
formidable and dangerous father in law, and showing little respect
to the authority of the King himself, and none whatever to the
remonstrances of Albany, his uncle, whom he looked upon as his confirmed
enemy.Amid these internal dissensions of his family, which extended themselves
through his councils and administration, introducing everywhere the
baneful effects of uncertainty and disunion, the feeble monarch had
for some time been supported by the counsels of his queen, Annabella, a
daughter of the noble house of Drummond, gifted with a depth of sagacity
and firmness of mind which exercised some restraint over the levities
of a son who respected her, and sustained on many occasions the wavering
resolution of her royal husband.But after her death the imbecile
sovereign resembled nothing so much as a vessel drifted from her
anchors, and tossed about amidst contending currents.Abstractedly
considered, Robert might be said to doat upon his son, to entertain
respect and awe for the character of his brother Albany, so much more
decisive than his own, to fear the Douglas with a terror which was
almost instinctive; and to suspect the constancy of the bold but fickle
Earl of March.But his feelings towards these various characters were
so mixed and complicated, that from time to time they showed entirely
different from what they really were; and according to the interest
which had been last exerted over his flexible mind, the King would
change from an indulgent to a strict and even cruel father, from a
confiding to a jealous brother, or from a benignant and bountiful to a
grasping and encroaching sovereign.Like the chameleon, his feeble mind
reflected the colour of that firmer character upon which at the time he
reposed for counsel and assistance.And when he disused the advice
of one of his family, and employed the counsel of another, it was no
unwonted thing to see a total change of measures, equally disrespectable
to the character of the King and dangerous to the safety of the state.It followed as a matter of course that the clergy of the Catholic Church
acquired influence over a man whose intentions were so excellent, but
whose resolutions were so infirm.Robert was haunted, not only with a
due sense of the errors he had really committed, but with the tormenting
apprehensions of those peccadilloes which beset a superstitious
and timid mind.It is scarce necessary, therefore, to add, that the
churchmen of various descriptions had no small influence over this
easy tempered prince, though, indeed, theirs was, at that period, an
influence from which few or none escaped, however resolute and firm of
purpose in affairs of a temporal character.We now return from this long
digression, without which what we have to relate could not perhaps have
been well understood.The King had moved with ungraceful difficulty to the cushioned chair
which, under a state or canopy, stood prepared for his accommodation,
and upon which he sank down with enjoyment, like an indolent man, who
had been for some time confined to a constrained position.When seated,
the gentle and venerable looks of the good old man showed benevolence.The prior, who now remained standing opposite to the royal seat, with
an air of deep deference which cloaked the natural haughtiness of his
carriage, was a man betwixt forty and fifty years of age, but every one
of whose hairs still retained their natural dark colour.Acute features
and a penetrating look attested the talents by which the venerable
father had acquired his high station in the community over which he
presided; and, we may add, in the councils of the kingdom, in whose
service they were often exercised.The chief objects which his education
and habits taught him to keep in view were the extension of the dominion
and the wealth of the church, and the suppression of heresy, both of
which he endeavoured to accomplish by all the means which his situation
afforded him.But he honoured his religion by the sincerity of his own
belief, and by the morality which guided his conduct in all ordinary
situations.The faults of the Prior Anselm, though they led him into
grievous error, and even cruelty, were perhaps rather those of his age
and profession; his virtues were his own."These things done," said the King, "and the lands I have mentioned
secured by my gift to this monastery, you are of opinion, father, that
I stand as much in the good graces of our Holy Mother Church as to term
myself her dutiful son?""Surely, my liege," said the prior; "would to God that all her children
brought to the efficacious sacrament of confession as deep a sense of
their errors, and as much will to make amends for them.But I speak
these comforting words, my liege, not to Robert King of Scotland, but
only to my humble and devout penitent, Robert Stuart of Carrick.""You surprise me, father," answered the King: "I have little check on my
conscience for aught that I have done in my kingly office, seeing that
I use therein less mine own opinion than the advice of the most wise
counsellors.""Even therein lieth the danger, my liege," replied the prior."The Holy
Father recognises in your Grace, in every thought, word, and action, an
obedient vassal of the Holy Church.But there are perverse counsellors,
who obey the instinct of their wicked hearts, while they abuse the good
nature and ductility of their monarch, and, under colour of serving his
temporal interests, take steps which are prejudicial to those that last
to eternity."King Robert raised himself upright in his chair, and assumed an air of
authority, which, though it well became him, he did not usually display."Prior Anselm," he said, "if you have discovered anything in my conduct,
whether as a king or a private individual, which may call down such
censures as your words intimate, it is your duty to speak plainly, and I
command you to do so.""My liege, you shall be obeyed," answered the prior, with an inclination
of the body.Then raising himself up, and assuming the dignity of his
rank in the church, he said, "Hear from me the words of our Holy Father
the Pope, the successor of St.Peter, to whom have descended the keys,
both to bind and to unloose.'Wherefore, O Robert of Scotland, hast
thou not received into the see of St.Andrews Henry of Wardlaw, whom the
Pontiff hath recommended to fill that see?Why dost thou make profession
with thy lips of dutiful service to the Church, when thy actions
proclaim the depravity and disobedience of thy inward soul?"Sir prior," said the monarch, bearing himself in a manner not
unbecoming his lofty rank, "we may well dispense with answering you upon
this subject, being a matter which concerns us and the estates of our
kingdom, but does not affect our private conscience.""Alas," said the prior, "and whose conscience will it concern at the
last day?Which of your belted lords or wealthy burgesses will then step
between their king and the penalty which he has incurred by following of
their secular policy in matters ecclesiastical?Know, mighty king, that,
were all the chivalry of thy realm drawn up to shield thee from the red
levin bolt, they would be consumed like scorched parchment before the
blaze of a furnace.""Good father prior," said the King, on whose timorous conscience this
kind of language seldom failed to make an impression, "you surely argue
over rigidly in this matter.It was during my last indisposition, while
the Earl of Douglas held, as lieutenant general, the regal authority in
Scotland, that the obstruction to the reception of the Primate unhappily
arose.Do not, therefore, tax me with what happened when I was unable to
conduct the affairs of the kingdom, and compelled to delegate my power
to another.""To your subject, sire, you have said enough," replied the prior."But,
if the impediment arose during the lieutenancy of the Earl of Douglas,
the legate of his Holiness will demand wherefore it has not been
instantly removed, when the King resumed in his royal hands the reins
of authority?The Black Douglas can do much--more perhaps than a subject
should have power to do in the kingdom of his sovereign; but he cannot
stand betwixt your Grace and your own conscience, or release you from
the duties to the Holy Church which your situation as a king imposes
upon you.""Father," said Robert, somewhat impatiently, "you are over peremptory
in this matter, and ought at least to wait a reasonable season, until
we have time to consider of some remedy.Such disputes have happened
repeatedly in the reigns of our predecessors; and our royal and blessed
ancestor, St.David, did not resign his privileges as a monarch
without making a stand in their defence, even though he was involved in
arguments with the Holy Father himself.""And therein was that great and good king neither holy nor saintly,"
said the prior "and therefore was he given to be a rout and a spoil to
his enemies, when he raised his sword against the banners of St.John of Beverley, in the war, as it is still
called, of the Standard.Well was it for him that, like his namesake,
the son of Jesse, his sin was punished upon earth, and not entered
against him at the long and dire day of accounting.""Well, good prior--well--enough of this for the present.The Holy See
shall, God willing, have no reason to complain of me.I take Our Lady
to witness, I would not for the crown I wear take the burden of wronging
our Mother Church.We have ever feared that the Earl of Douglas kept his
eyes too much fixed on the fame and the temporalities of this frail and
passing life to feel altogether as he ought the claims that refer to a
future world.""It is but lately," said the prior, "that he hath taken up forcible
quarters in the monastery of Aberbrothock, with his retinue of a
thousand followers; and the abbot is compelled to furnish him with
all he needs for horse and man, which the Earl calls exercising the
hospitality which he hath a right to expect from the foundation to which
his ancestors were contributors.Certain, it were better to return
to the Douglas his lands than to submit to such exaction, which more
resembles the masterful license of Highland thiggers and sorners [sturdy
beggars], than the demeanour of a Christian baron.""The Black Douglasses," said the King, with a sigh, "are a race which
will not be said nay.But, father prior, I am myself, it may be, an
intruder of this kind; for my sojourning hath been long among you, and
my retinue, though far fewer than the Douglas's, are nevertheless enough
to cumber you for their daily maintenance; and though our order is to
send out purveyors to lessen your charge as much as may be, yet if there
be inconvenience, it were fitting we should remove in time."said the prior, who, if desirous of power, had
nothing meanly covetous in his temper, but was even magnificent in his
generous kindness; "certainly the Dominican convent can afford to her
sovereign the hospitality which the house offers to every wanderer of
whatever condition who will receive it at the hands of the poor servants
of our patron.No, my royal liege; come with ten times your present
train, they shall neither want a grain of oats, a pile of straw, a
morsel of bread, nor an ounce of food which our convent can supply them.It is one thing to employ the revenues of the church, which are so much
larger than monks ought to need or wish for, in the suitable and dutiful
reception of your royal Majesty, and another to have it wrenched from
us by the hands of rude and violent men, whose love of rapine is only
limited by the extent of their power.""It is well, good prior," said the King; "and now to turn our thoughts
for an instant from state affairs, can thy reverence inform us how the
good citizens of Perth have begun their Valentine's Day?Gallantly, and
merrily, and peacefully; I hope.""For gallantly, my liege, I know little of such qualities.For
peacefully, there were three or four men, two cruelly wounded, came this
morning before daylight to ask the privilege of girth and sanctuary,
pursued by a hue and cry of citizens in their shirts, with clubs, bills,
Lochaber axes, and two handed swords, crying 'Kill and slay,' each
louder than another.Nay, they were not satisfied when our porter and
watch told them that those they pursued had taken refuge in the galilee
of the church, but continued for some minutes clamouring and striking
upon the postern door, demanding that the men who had offended should
be delivered up to them.I was afraid their rude noise might have broken
your Majesty's rest, and raised some surprise.""My rest might have been broken," said the monarch; "but that sounds of
violence should have occasioned surprise--Alas!reverend father, there
is in Scotland only one place where the shriek of the victim and threats
of the oppressor are not heard, and that, father, is--the grave."The prior stood in respectful silence, sympathising with the feelings of
a monarch whose tenderness of heart suited so ill with the condition and
manners of his people.asked Robert, after a minute's
pause."Surely, sire," said the prior, "they were dismissed, as they desired
to be, before daylight; and after we had sent out to be assured that no
ambush of their enemies watched them in the vicinity, they went their
way in peace.""You know nothing," inquired the King, "who the men were, or the cause
of their taking refuge with you?""The cause," said the prior, "was a riot with the townsmen; but how
arising is not known to us.The custom of our house is to afford
twenty-four hours of uninterrupted refuge in the sanctuary of St.Dominic, without asking any question at the poor unfortunates who have
sought relief there.If they desire to remain for a longer space, the
cause of their resorting to sanctuary must be put upon the register of
the convent; and, praised be our holy saint, many persons escape the
weight of the law by this temporary protection, whom, did we know the
character of their crimes, we might have found ourselves obliged to
render up to their pursuers and persecutors."As the prior spoke, a dim idea occurred to the monarch, that the
privilege of sanctuary thus peremptorily executed must prove a severe
interruption to the course of justice through his realm.But he repelled
the feeling, as if it had been a suggestion of Satan, and took care that
not a single word should escape to betray to the churchman that such a
profane thought had ever occupied his bosom; on the contrary, he hasted
to change the subject."The sun," he said, "moves slowly on the index.After the painful
information you have given me, I expected the Lords of my Council ere
now, to take order with the ravelled affairs of this unhappy riot.Evil
was the fortune which gave me rule over a people among whom it seems
to me I am in my own person the only man who desires rest and
tranquillity!""The church always desires peace and tranquillity," added the prior,
not suffering even so general a proposition to escape the poor king's
oppressed mind without insisting on a saving clause for the church's
honour."But, father prior, you will
allow that the church, in quelling strife, as is doubtless her purpose,
resembles the busy housewife, who puts in motion the dust which she
means to sweep away."To this remark the prior would have made some reply, but the door of
the apartment was opened, and a gentleman usher announced the Duke of
Albany.CHAPTER X.

     Gentle friend,
     Chide not her mirth, who was sad yesterday,
     And may be so tomorrow.The Duke of Albany was, like his royal brother, named Robert.The
Christian name of the latter had been John until he was called to the
throne; when the superstition of the times observed that the name
had been connected with misfortune in the lives and reigns of John of
England, John of France, and John Baliol of Scotland.It was therefore
agreed that, to elude the bad omen, the new king should assume the name
of Robert, rendered dear to Scotland by the recollections of Robert
Bruce.We mention this to account for the existence of two brothers of
the same Christian name in one family, which was not certainly an usual
occurrence, more than at the present day.Albany, also an aged man, was not supposed to be much more disposed for
warlike enterprise than the King himself.But if he had not courage, he
had wisdom to conceal and cloak over his want of that quality, which,
once suspected, would have ruined all the plans which his ambition had
formed.He had also pride enough to supply, in extremity, the want
of real valour, and command enough over his nerves to conceal their
agitation.In other respects, he was experienced in the ways of courts,
calm, cool, and crafty, fixing upon the points which he desired to
attain, while they were yet far removed, and never losing sight of them,
though the winding paths in which he trode might occasionally seem to
point to a different direction.In his person he resembled the King, for
he was noble and majestic both in stature and countenance.But he had
the advantage of his elder brother, in being unencumbered with any
infirmity, and in every respect lighter and more active.His dress was
rich and grave, as became his age and rank, and, like his royal brother,
he wore no arms of any kind, a case of small knives supplying at his
girdle the place usually occupied by a dagger in absence of a sword.At the Duke's entrance the prior, after making an obeisance,
respectfully withdrew to a recess in the apartment, at some distance
from the royal seat, in order to leave the conversation of the brothers
uncontrolled by the presence of a third person.It is necessary to
mention, that the recess was formed by a window; placed in the inner
front of the monastic buildings, called the palace, from its being the
frequent residence of the Kings of Scotland, but which was, unless on
such occasions, the residence of the prior or abbot.The window
was placed over the principal entrance to the royal apartments, and
commanded a view of the internal quadrangle of the convent, formed on
the right hand by the length of the magnificent church, on the left by
a building containing the range of cellars, with the refectory, chapter
house, and other conventual apartments rising above them, for such
existed altogether independent of the space occupied by King Robert and
his attendants; while a fourth row of buildings, showing a noble
outward front to the rising sun, consisted of a large hospitium, for
the reception of strangers and pilgrims, and many subordinate offices,
warehouses, and places of accommodation, for the ample stores which
supplied the magnificent hospitality of the Dominican fathers.A lofty
vaulted entrance led through this eastern front into the quadrangle,
and was precisely opposite to the window at which Prior Anselm stood, so
that he could see underneath the dark arch, and observe the light which
gleamed beneath it from the eastern and open portal; but, owing to the
height to which he was raised, and the depth of the vaulted archway, his
eye could but indistinctly reach the opposite and extended portal.It is
necessary to notice these localities.We return to the conversation between the princely relatives."My dear brother," said the King, raising the Duke of Albany, as
he stooped to kiss his hand--"my dear, dear brother, wherefore this
ceremonial?Are we not both sons of the same Stuart of Scotland and of
the same Elizabeth More?""I have not forgot that it is so," said Albany, arising; "but I must not
omit, in the familiarity of the brother, the respect that is due to the
king.""Oh, true--most true, Robin," answered the King."The throne is like a
lofty and barren rock, upon which flower or shrub can never take root.All kindly feelings, all tender affections, are denied to a monarch.A king must not fold a brother to his heart--he dare not give way to
fondness for a son.""Such, in some respects, is the doom of greatness, sire," answered
Albany; "but Heaven, who removed to some distance from your Majesty's
sphere the members of your own family, has given you a whole people to
be your children."Robert," answered the monarch, "your heart is better framed for
the duties of a sovereign than mine.I see from the height at which fate
has placed me that multitude whom you call my children.I love them, I
wish them well; but they are many, and they are distant from me.even the meanest of them has some beloved being whom he can clasp to
his heart, and upon whom he can lavish the fondness of a father.But all
that a king can give to a people is a smile, such as the sun bestows
on the snowy peaks of the Grampian mountains, as distant and as
ineffectual.our father used to caress us, and if he chid
us it was with a tone of kindness; yet he was a monarch as well as I,
and wherefore should not I be permitted, like him, to reclaim my poor
prodigal by affection as well as severity?""Had affection never been tried, my liege," replied Albany, in the tone
of one who delivers sentiments which he grieves to utter, "means of
gentleness ought assuredly to be first made use of.Your Grace is best
judge whether they have been long enough persevered in, and whether
those of discouragement and restraint may not prove a more effectual
corrective.It is exclusively in your royal power to take what measures
with the Duke of Rothsay you think will be most available to his
ultimate benefit, and that of the kingdom.""This is unkind, brother," said the King: "you indicate the painful path
which you would have me pursue, yet you offer me not your support in
treading it.""My support your Grace may ever command," replied Albany; "but would it
become me, of all men on earth, to prompt to your Grace severe measures
against your son and heir?Me, on whom, in case of failure--which Heaven
forefend!--of your Grace's family, this fatal crown might descend?Would
it not be thought and said by the fiery March and the haughty Douglas,
that Albany had sown dissension between his royal brother and the heir
to the Scottish throne, perhaps to clear the way for the succession of
his own family?No, my liege, I can sacrifice my life to your service,
but I must not place my honour in danger.""You say true, Robin.--you say very true," replied the King, hastening
to put his own interpretation upon his brother's words."We must not
suffer these powerful and dangerous lords to perceive that there is
aught like discord in the royal family.That must be avoided of all
things: and therefore we will still try indulgent measures, in hopes
of correcting the follies of Rothsay.I behold sparks of hope in
him, Robin, from time to time, that are well worth cherishing.He is
young--very young--a prince, and in the heyday of his blood.We will
have patience with him, like a good rider with a hot tempered horse.Let
him exhaust this idle humor, and no one will be better pleased with
him than yourself.You have censured me in your kindness for being too
gentle, too retired; Rothsay has no such defects.""I will pawn my life he has not," replied Albany, drily."And he wants not reflection as well as spirit," continued the poor
king, pleading the cause of his son to his brother."I have sent for him
to attend council today, and we shall see how he acquits himself of
his devoir.You yourself allow, Robin, that the Prince wants neither
shrewdness nor capacity for affairs, when he is in the humor to consider
them.""Doubtless, he wants neither, my liege," replied Albany, "when he is in
the humor to consider them.""I say so," answered the King; "and am heartily glad that you agree with
me, Robin, in giving this poor hapless young man another trial.He has
no mother now to plead his cause with an incensed father.That must be
remembered, Albany.""I trust," said Albany, "the course which is most agreeable to your
Grace's feelings will also prove the wisest and the best."The Duke well saw the simple stratagem by which the King was
endeavouring to escape from the conclusions of his reasoning, and
to adopt, under pretence of his sanction, a course of proceeding the
reverse of what it best suited him to recommend.But though he saw he
could not guide his brother to the line of conduct he desired, he would
not abandon the reins, but resolved to watch for a fitter opportunity of
obtaining the sinister advantages to which new quarrels betwixt the King
and Prince were soon, he thought, likely to give rise.In the mean time, King Robert, afraid lest his brother should resume
the painful subject from which he had just escaped, called aloud to the
prior of the Dominicans, "I hear the trampling of horse.Your station
commands the courtyard, reverend father.Look from the window, and tell
us who alights."The noble Earl of March, with his followers," said the prior."Do his people enter the
inner gate?"At the same moment, Albany whispered the King, "Fear nothing, the
Brandanes of your household are under arms."The King nodded thanks, while the prior from the window answered the
question he had put."The Earl is attended by two pages, two gentlemen,
and four grooms.One page follows him up the main staircase, bearing his
lordship's sword.The others halt in the court, and--Benedicite, how is
this?Here is a strolling glee woman, with her viol, preparing to sing
beneath the royal windows, and in the cloister of the Dominicans, as
she might in the yard of an hostelrie!"Not so, father," said the King."Let me implore grace for the poor
wanderer.The joyous science, as they call it, which they profess,
mingles sadly with the distresses to which want and calamity condemn a
strolling race; and in that they resemble a king, to whom all men cry,
'All hail!'while he lacks the homage and obedient affection which
the poorest yeoman receives from his family.Let the wanderer remain
undisturbed, father; and let her sing if she will to the yeomen and
troopers in the court; it will keep them from quarrelling with each
other, belonging, as they do, to such unruly and hostile masters."So spoke the well meaning and feeble minded prince, and the prior bowed
in acquiescence.As he spoke, the Earl of March entered the hall of
audience, dressed in the ordinary riding garb of the time, and wearing
his poniard.He had left in the anteroom the page of honour who carried
his sword.The Earl was a well built, handsome man, fair complexioned,
with a considerable profusion of light  hair, and bright
blue eyes, which gleamed like those of a falcon.He exhibited in his
countenance, otherwise pleasing, the marks of a hasty and irritable
temper, which his situation as a high and powerful feudal lord had given
him but too many opportunities of indulging."I am glad to see you, my Lord of March," said the King, with a
gracious inclination of his person."You have been long absent from our
councils.""My liege," answered March with a deep reverence to the King, and a
haughty and formal inclination to the Duke of Albany, "if I have been
absent from your Grace's councils, it is because my place has been
supplied by more acceptable, and, I doubt not, abler, counsellors.And
now I come but to say to your Highness, that the news from the English
frontier make it necessary that I should return without delay to my
own estates.Your Grace has your wise and politic brother, my Lord of
Albany, with whom to consult, and the mighty and warlike Earl of Douglas
to carry your counsels into effect.I am of no use save in my own
country; and thither, with your Highness's permission, I am purposed
instantly to return, to attend my charge, as Warden of the Eastern
Marches.""You will not deal so unkindly with us, cousin," replied the gentle
monarch."Here are evil tidings on the wind.These unhappy Highland
clans are again breaking into general commotion, and the tranquillity
even of our own court requires the wisest of our council to advise, and
the bravest of our barons to execute, what may be resolved upon.The
descendant of Thomas Randolph will not surely abandon the grandson of
Robert Bruce at such a period as this?""I leave with him the descendant of the far famed James of Douglas,"
answered March."It is his lordship's boast that he never puts foot in
stirrup but a thousand horse mount with him as his daily lifeguard, and
I believe the monks of Aberbrothock will swear to the fact.Surely, with
all the Douglas's chivalry, they are fitter to restrain a disorderly
swarm of Highland kerne than I can be to withstand the archery of
England and power of Henry Hotspur?And then, here is his Grace of
Albany, so jealous in his care of your Highness's person, that he
calls your Brandanes to take arms when a dutiful subject like myself
approaches the court with a poor half score of horse, the retinue of
the meanest of the petty barons who own a tower and a thousand acres
of barren heath.When such precautions are taken where there is not the
slightest chance of peril--since I trust none was to be apprehended from
me--your royal person will surely be suitably guarded in real danger.""My Lord of March," said the Duke of Albany, "the meanest of the barons
of whom you speak put their followers in arms even when they receive
their dearest and nearest friends within the iron gate of their castle;
and, if it please Our Lady, I will not care less for the King's person
than they do for their own.The Brandanes are the King's immediate
retainers and household servants, and an hundred of them is but a small
guard round his Grace, when yourself, my lord, as well as the Earl of
Douglas, often ride with ten times the number.""My Lord Duke," replied March, "when the service of the King requires
it, I can ride with ten times as many horse as your Grace has named;
but I have never done so either traitorously to entrap the King nor
boastfully to overawe other nobles.""Brother Robert," said the King, ever anxious to be a peacemaker, "you
do wrong even to intimate a suspicion of my Lord of March.And you,
cousin of March, misconstrue my brother's caution.But hark--to divert
this angry parley--I hear no unpleasing touch of minstrelsy.You know
the gay science, my Lord of March, and love it well.Step to yonder
window, beside the holy prior, at whom we make no question touching
secular pleasures, and you will tell us if the music and play be worth
listening to.My brother of Albany's
judgment is not worth a cockle shell in such matters, so you, cousin,
must report your opinion whether the poor glee maiden deserves
recompense.Our son and the Douglas will presently be here, and then,
when our council is assembled, we will treat of graver matters."With something like a smile on his proud brow, March withdrew into the
recess of the window, and stood there in silence beside the prior, like
one who, while he obeyed the King's command, saw through and despised
the timid precaution which it implied, as an attempt to prevent the
dispute betwixt Albany and himself.The tune, which was played upon a
viol, was gay and sprightly in the commencement, with a touch of the
wildness of the troubadour music.But, as it proceeded, the faltering
tones of the instrument, and of the female voice which accompanied it,
became plaintive and interrupted, as if choked by the painful feelings
of the minstrel.The offended earl, whatever might be his judgment in such matters on
which the King had complimented him, paid, it may be supposed, little
attention to the music of the female minstrel.His proud heart was
struggling between the allegiance he owed his sovereign, as well as
the love he still found lurking in his bosom for the person of his well
natured king, and a desire of vengeance arising out of his disappointed
ambition, and the disgrace done to him by the substitution of Marjory
Douglas to be bride of the heir apparent, instead of his betrothed
daughter.March had the vices and virtues of a hasty and uncertain
character, and even now, when he came to bid the King adieu, with the
purpose of renouncing his allegiance as soon as he reached his own
feudal territories, he felt unwilling, and almost unable, to resolve
upon a step so criminal and so full of peril.It was with such dangerous
cogitations that he was occupied during the beginning of the glee
maiden's lay; but objects which called his attention powerfully, as the
songstress proceeded, affected the current of his thoughts, and riveted
them on what was passing in the courtyard of the monastery.The song was
in the Provencal dialect, well understood as the language of poetry
in all the courts of Europe, and particularly in Scotland.It was more
simply turned, however, than was the general cast of the sirventes,
and rather resembled the lai of a Norman minstrel.It may be translated
thus:

     The Lay of Poor Louise.The livelong day
     She roams from cot to castle gay;
     And still her voice and viol say,
     Ah, maids, beware the woodland way;
     Think on Louise.The sun was high;
     It smirch'd her cheek, it dimm'd her eye.The woodland walk was cool and nigh,
     Where birds with chiming streamlets vie
     To cheer Louise.The savage bear
     Made ne'er that lovely grove his lair;
     The wolves molest not paths so fair.But better far had such been there
     For poor Louise.In woody wold
     She met a huntsman fair and bold;
     His baldrick was of silk and gold,
     And many a witching tale he told
     To poor Louise.Small cause to pine
     Hadst thou for treasures of the mine;
     For peace of mind, that gift divine,
     And spotless innocence, were thine.I know not if by force or theft,
     Or part by violence, part by gift;
     But misery is all that's left
     To poor Louise,

     Let poor Louise some succour have!She will not long your bounty crave,
     Or tire the gay with warning stave;
     For Heaven has grace, and earth a grave
     For poor Louise.The song was no sooner finished than, anxious lest the dispute should be
revived betwixt his brother and the Earl of March, King Robert called to
the latter, "What think you of the minstrelsy, my lord?Methinks, as I
heard it even at this distance, it was a wild and pleasing lay.""My judgment is not deep my lord; but the singer may dispense with
my approbation, since she seems to have received that of his Grace of
Rothsay, the best judge in Scotland."said the King in alarm; "is my son below?""He is sitting on horseback by the glee maiden," said March, with a
malicious smile on his cheek, "apparently as much interested by her
conversation as her music."But the prior drew back from the lattice."I have no will to see, my
lord, things which it would pain me to repeat."said the King, who  deeply, and seemed about
to rise from his chair; but changed his mind, as if unwilling, perhaps,
to look upon some unbecoming prank of the wild young prince, which he
might not have had heart to punish with necessary severity.The Earl
of March seemed to have a pleasure in informing him of that of which
doubtless he desired to remain ignorant."My liege," he cried, "this is better and better.The glee maiden has
not only engaged the ear of the Prince of Scotland, as well as of every
groom and trooper in the courtyard, but she has riveted the attention of
the Black Douglas, whom we have not known as a passionate admirer of
the gay science.But truly, I do not wonder at his astonishment, for the
Prince has honoured the fair professor of song and viol with a kiss of
approbation."cried the King, "is David of Rothsay trifling with a glee maiden,
and his wife's father in presence?Go, my good father abbot, call the
Prince here instantly.Go, my dearest brother--" And when they had both
left the room, the King continued, "Go, good cousin of March; there will
be mischief, I am assured of it.I pray you go, cousin, and second my
lord prior's prayers with my commands.""You forget, my liege," said March, with the voice of a deeply offended
person, "the father of Elizabeth of Dunbar were but an unfit intercessor
between the Douglas and his royal son in law.""I crave your pardon, cousin," said the gentle old man."I own you have
had some wrong; but my Rothsay will be murdered--I must go myself."But, as he arose precipitately from his chair, the poor king missed a
footstep, stumbled, and fell heavily to the ground, in such a manner
that, his head striking the corner of the seat from which he had risen,
he became for a minute insensible.The sight of the accident at once
overcame March's resentment and melted his heart.He ran to the fallen
monarch, and replaced him in his seat, using, in the tenderest and most
respectful manner, such means as seemed most fit to recall animation.Robert opened his eyes, and gazed around with uncertainty."What has
happened?--are we alone?--who is with us?""Your dutiful subject, March," replied the Earl.repeated the King, his still disturbed
intellect receiving some alarm from the name of a powerful chief whom he
had reason to believe he had mortally offended."Yes, my gracious liege, with poor George of Dunbar, of whom many have
wished your Majesty to think ill, though he will be found truer to your
royal person at the last than they will.""Indeed, cousin, you have had too much wrong; and believe me, we shall
strive to redress--"

"If your Grace thinks so, it may yet be righted," interrupted the Earl,
catching at the hopes which his ambition suggested: "the Prince and
Marjory Douglas are nearly related--the dispensation from Rome was
informally granted--their marriage cannot be lawful--the Pope, who will
do much for so godly a prince, can set aside this unchristian union, in
respect of the pre-contract.Bethink you well, my liege," continued
the Earl, kindling with a new train of ambitious thoughts, to which
the unexpected opportunity of pleading his cause personally had given
rise--"bethink you how you choose betwixt the Douglas and me.He is
powerful and mighty, I grant.But George of Dunbar wears the keys of
Scotland at his belt, and could bring an English army to the gates of
Edinburgh ere Douglas could leave the skirts of Carintable to oppose
them.Your royal son loves my poor deserted girl, and hates the haughty
Marjory of Douglas.Your Grace may judge the small account in which he
holds her by his toying with a common glee maiden even in the presence
of her father."The King had hitherto listened to the Earl's argument with the
bewildered feelings of a timid horseman, borne away by an impetuous
steed, whose course he can neither arrest nor direct.But the last words
awakened in his recollection the sense of his son's immediate danger."Oh, ay, most true--my son--the Douglas!Oh, my dear cousin, prevent
blood, and all shall be as you will.Hark, there is a tumult--that was
the clash of arms!""By my coronet, by my knightly faith, it is true!"said the Earl,
looking from the window upon the inner square of the convent, now filled
with armed men and brandished weapons, and resounding with the clash
of armour.The deep vaulted entrance was crowded with warriors at its
farthest extremity, and blows seemed to be in the act of being exchanged
betwixt some who were endeavouring to shut the gate and others who
contended to press in."I will go instantly," said the Earl of March, "and soon quell this
sudden broil.Humbly I pray your Majesty to think on what I have had the
boldness to propose.""I will--I will, fair cousin," said the King, scarce knowing to what he
pledged himself; "do but prevent tumult and bloodshed!"CHAPTER XI

     Fair is the damsel, passing fair;
     Sunny at distance gleams her smile;
     Approach--the cloud of woful care
     Hangs trembling in her eye the while.We must here trace a little more correctly the events which had been
indistinctly seen from the window of the royal apartments, and yet more
indistinctly reported by those who witnessed them.The glee maiden,
already mentioned, had planted herself where a rise of two large broad
steps, giving access to the main gateway of the royal apartments, gained
her an advantage of a foot and a half in height over those in the
court, of whom she hoped to form an audience.She wore the dress of her
calling, which was more gaudy than rich, and showed the person more than
did the garb of other females.She had laid aside an upper mantle, and
a small basket which contained her slender stock of necessaries; and a
little French spaniel dog sat beside them, as their protector.An azure
blue jacket, embroidered with silver, and sitting close to the person,
was open in front, and showed several waistcoats of different 
silks, calculated to set off the symmetry of the shoulders and bosom,
and remaining open at the throat.A small silver chain worn around her
neck involved itself amongst these brilliant  waistcoats, and
was again produced from them; to display a medal of the same metal,
which intimated, in the name of some court or guild of minstrels,
the degree she had taken in the gay or joyous science.A small scrip,
suspended over her shoulders by a blue silk riband; hung on her left
side.Her sunny complexion, snow white teeth, brilliant black eyes, and raven
locks marked her country lying far in the south of France, and the arch
smile and dimpled chin bore the same character.Her luxuriant raven
locks, twisted around a small gold bodkin, were kept in their position
by a net of silk and gold.Short petticoats, deep laced with silver, to
correspond with the jacket, red stockings which were visible so high as
near the calf of the leg, and buskins of Spanish leather, completed her
adjustment, which, though far from new, had been saved as an untarnished
holiday suit, which much care had kept in good order.She seemed about
twenty-five years old; but perhaps fatigue and wandering had anticipated
the touch of time in obliterating the freshness of early youth.We have said the glee maiden's manner was lively, and we may add that
her smile and repartee were ready.But her gaiety was assumed, as a
quality essentially necessary to her trade, of which it was one of the
miseries, that the professors were obliged frequently to cover an aching
heart with a compelled smile.This seemed to be the case with Louise,
who, whether she was actually the heroine of her own song, or whatever
other cause she might have for sadness, showed at times a strain of deep
melancholy thought, which interfered with and controlled the natural
flow of lively spirits which the practice of the joyous science
especially required.She lacked also, even in her gayest sallies, the
decided boldness and effrontery of her sisterhood, who were seldom at
a loss to retort a saucy jest, or turn the laugh against any who
interrupted or interfered with them.It may be here remarked, that it was impossible that this class of
women, very numerous in that age, could bear a character generally
respectable.They were, however, protected by the manners of the time;
and such were the immunities they possessed by the rights of chivalry,
that nothing was more rare than to hear of such errant damsels
sustaining injury or wrong, and they passed and repassed safely, where
armed travellers would probably have encountered a bloody opposition.But though licensed and protected in honour of their tuneful art, the
wandering minstrels, male or female, like similar ministers to the
public amusement, the itinerant musicians, for instance, and strolling
comedians of our own day, led a life too irregular and precarious to
be accounted a creditable part of society.Indeed, among the stricter
Catholics, the profession was considered as unlawful.Such was the damsel who, with viol in hand, and stationed on the slight
elevation we have mentioned, stepped forward to the bystanders and
announced herself as a mistress of the gay science, duly qualified by a
brief from a Court of Love and Music held at Aix, in Provence, under the
countenance of the flower of chivalry, the gallant Count Aymer; who now
prayed that the cavaliers of merry Scotland, who were known over the
wide world for bravery and courtesy, would permit a poor stranger to try
whether she could afford them any amusement by her art.The love of song
was like the love of fight, a common passion of the age, which all
at least affected, whether they were actually possessed by it or no;
therefore the acquiescence in Louise's proposal was universal.At
the same time, an aged, dark browed monk who was among the bystanders
thought it necessary to remind the glee maiden that, since she was
tolerated within these precincts, which was an unusual grace, he trusted
nothing would be sung or said inconsistent with the holy character of
the place.The glee maiden bent her head low, shook her sable locks, and crossed
herself reverentially, as if she disclaimed the possibility of such a
transgression, and then began the song of "Poor Louise."which we gave
at length in the last chapter.Just as she commenced, she was stopped by a cry of "Room--room--place
for the Duke of Rothsay!""Nay, hurry no man on my score," said a gallant young cavalier, who
entered on a noble Arabian horse, which he managed with exquisite grace,
though by such slight handling of the reins, such imperceptible pressure
of the limbs and sway of the body, that to any eye save that of an
experienced horseman the animal seemed to be putting forth his paces for
his own amusement, and thus gracefully bearing forward a rider who was
too indolent to give himself any trouble about the matter.The Prince's apparel, which was very rich, was put on with slovenly
carelessness.His form, though his stature was low, and his limbs
extremely slight, was elegant in the extreme; and his features no less
handsome.But there was on his brow a haggard paleness, which seemed
the effect of care or of dissipation, or of both these wasting causes
combined.His eyes were sunk and dim, as from late indulgence in revelry
on the preceding evening, while his cheek was inflamed with unnatural
red, as if either the effect of the Bacchanalian orgies had not passed
away from the constitution, or a morning draught had been resorted to,
in order to remove the effects of the night's debauchery.Such was the Duke of Rothsay, and heir of the Scottish crown, a sight
at once of interest and compassion.All unbonneted and made way for him,
while he kept repeating carelessly, "No haste--no haste: I shall arrive
soon enough at the place I am bound for.How's this--a damsel of the
joyous science?Stand
still, my merry men; never was minstrelsy marred for me.Louise did not know the person who addressed her; but the general
respect paid by all around, and the easy and indifferent manner in which
it was received, showed her she was addressed by a man of the highest
quality.She recommenced her lay, and sung her best accordingly; while
the young duke seemed thoughtful and rather affected towards the close
of the ditty.But it was not his habit to cherish such melancholy
affections."This is a plaintive ditty, my nut brown maid," said he, chucking the
retreating glee maiden under the chin, and detaining her by the collar
of her dress, which was not difficult, as he sat on horseback so close
to the steps on which she stood."But I warrant me you have livelier
notes at will, ma bella tenebrosa; ay, and canst sing in bower as well
as wold, and by night as well as day.""I am no nightingale, my lord," said Louise, endeavouring to escape a
species of gallantry which ill suited the place and circumstances--a
discrepancy to which he who addressed it to her seemed contemptuously
indifferent.he added, removing his hold from her
collar to the scrip which she carried.Glad was Louise to escape his grasp, by slipping the knot of the riband,
and leaving the little bag in the Prince's hand, as, retiring back
beyond his reach, she answered, "Nuts, my lord, of the last season."The Prince pulled out a handful of nuts accordingly.they
will break thine ivory teeth, hurt thy pretty voice," said Rothsay,
cracking one with his teeth, like a village schoolboy."They are not the walnuts of my own sunny clime, my lord," said Louise;
"but they hang low, and are within the reach of the poor.""You shall have something to afford you better fare, poor wandering
ape," said the Duke, in a tone in which feeling predominated more than
in the affected and contemptuous gallantry of his first address to the
glee maiden.At this moment, as he turned to ask an attendant for his purse, the
Prince encountered the stern and piercing look of a tall black man,
seated on a powerful iron grey horse, who had entered the court with
attendants while the Duke of Rothsay was engaged with Louise, and now
remained stupefied and almost turned to stone by his surprise and anger
at this unseemly spectacle.Even one who had never seen Archibald
Earl of Douglas, called the Grim, must have known him by his swart
complexion, his gigantic frame, his buff coat of bull's hide, and his
air of courage, firmness, and sagacity, mixed with indomitable pride.The loss of an eye in battle, though not perceptible at first sight, as
the ball of the injured organ remained similar to the other, gave yet a
stern, immovable glare to the whole aspect.The meeting of the royal son in law with his terrible stepfather
[father in law] was in circumstances which arrested the attention of all
present; and the bystanders waited the issue with silence and suppressed
breath, lest they should lose any part of what was to ensue.When the Duke of Rothsay saw the expression which occupied the stern
features of Douglas, and remarked that the Earl did not make the
least motion towards respectful, or even civil, salutation, he seemed
determined to show him how little respect he was disposed to pay to his
displeased looks."Here, pretty one," he said, "I give thee one gold piece for the song
thou hast sung me, another for the nuts I have stolen from thee, and a
third for the kiss thou art about to give me.For know, my pretty one,
that when fair lips, and thine for fault of better may be called so,
make sweet music for my pleasure, I am sworn to St.Valentine to press
them to mine.""My song is recompensed nobly," said Louise, shrinking back; "my nuts
are sold to a good market; farther traffic, my lord, were neither
befitting you nor beseeming me."you coy it, my nymph of the highway?""Know damsel, that one asks you a grace who is unused to
denial.""It is the Prince of Scotland--the Duke of Rothsay," said the courtiers
around, to the terrified Louise, pressing forward the trembling young
woman; "you must not thwart his humor.""But I cannot reach your lordship," she said, timidly, "you sit so high
on horseback.""If I must alight," said Rothsay, "there shall be the heavier penalty.Place thy foot on the toe of my boot,
give me hold of thy hand.He kissed her as she stood
thus suspended in the air, perched upon his foot and supported by his
hand; saying, "There is thy kiss, and there is my purse to pay it; and
to grace thee farther, Rothsay will wear thy scrip for the day."He suffered the frightened girl to spring to the ground, and turned his
looks from her to bend them contemptuously on the Earl of Douglas, as
if he had said, "All this I do in despite of you and of your daughter's
claims."said the Earl, pressing towards the Prince,
"this is too much, unmannered boy, as void of sense as honour!You know
what considerations restrain the hand of Douglas, else had you never
dared--"

"Can you play at spang cockle, my lord?"said the Prince, placing a nut
on the second joint of his forefinger, and spinning it off by a smart
application of the thumb.The nut struck on Douglas's broad breast,
who burst out into a dreadful exclamation of wrath, inarticulate, but
resembling the growl of a lion in depth and sternness of expression."I cry your pardon, most mighty lord," said the Duke of Rothsay,
scornfully, while all around trembled; "I did not conceive my pellet
could have wounded you, seeing you wear a buff coat.Surely, I trust, it
did not hit your eye?"The prior, despatched by the King, as we have seen in the last chapter,
had by this time made way through the crowd, and laying hold on
Douglas's rein, in a manner that made it impossible for him to advance,
reminded him that the Prince was the son of his sovereign; and the
husband of his daughter."Fear not, sir prior," said Douglas."I despise the childish boy too
much to raise a finger against him.Here, any of you who love the Douglas, spurn me this quean from the
monastery gates; and let her be so scourged that she may bitterly
remember to the last day of her life how she gave means to an
unrespective boy to affront the Douglas."Four or five retainers instantly stepped forth to execute commands which
were seldom uttered in vain, and heavily would Louise have atoned for an
offence of which she was alike the innocent, unconscious, and unwilling
instrument, had not the Duke of Rothsay interfered.he said, in high indignation; "scourge
her for obeying my commands!Spurn thine own oppressed vassals, rude
earl--scourge thine own faulty hounds; but beware how you touch so much
as a dog that Rothsay hath patted on the head, far less a female whose
lips he hath kissed!"Before Douglas could give an answer, which would certainly have been
in defiance, there arose that great tumult at the outward gate of the
monastery, already noticed, and men both on horseback and on foot
began to rush headlong in, not actually fighting with each other, but
certainly in no peaceable manner.One of the contending parties, seemingly, were partizans of Douglas,
known by the cognizance of the bloody heart; the other were composed of
citizens of the town of Perth.It appeared they had been skirmishing in
earnest when without the gates, but, out of respect to the sanctified
ground, they lowered their weapons when they entered, and confined their
strife to a war of words and mutual abuse.The tumult had this good effect, that it forced asunder, by the weight
and press of numbers, the Prince and Douglas, at a moment when the
levity of the former and the pride of the latter were urging both to the
utmost extremity.But now peacemakers interfered on all sides.The prior
and the monks threw themselves among the multitude, and commanded
peace in the name of Heaven, and reverence to their sacred walls,
under penalty of excommunication; and their expostulations began to
be listened to.Albany, who was despatched by his royal brother at the
beginning of the fray, had not arrived till now on the scene of action.He instantly applied himself to Douglas, and in his ear conjured him to
temper his passion.Bride of Douglas, I will be avenged!""No man
shall brook life after he has passed an affront on Douglas.""Why, so you may be avenged in fitting time," said Albany; "but let it
not be said that, like a peevish woman, the Great Douglas could choose
neither time nor place for his vengeance.Bethink you, all that we have
laboured at is like to be upset by an accident.George of Dunbar hath
had the advantage of an audience with the old man; and though it lasted
but five minutes, I fear it may endanger the dissolution of your family
match, which we brought about with so much difficulty.The authority
from Rome has not yet been obtained."answered Douglas, haughtily; "they dare not dissolve it.""Not while Douglas is at large, and in possession of his power,"
answered Albany."But, noble earl, come with me, and I will show you at
what disadvantage you stand."Douglas dismounted, and followed his wily accomplice in silence.In a
lower hall they saw the ranks of the Brandanes drawn up, well armed in
caps of steel and shirts of mail.Their captain, making an obeisance to
Albany, seemed to desire to address him."We are informed the Duke of Rothsay has been insulted, and I can scarce
keep the Brandanes within door.""Gallant MacLouis," said Albany, "and you, my trusty Brandanes, the Duke
of Rothsay, my princely nephew, is as well as a hopeful gentleman can
be.Some scuffle there has been, but all is appeased."He continued to draw the Earl of Douglas forward."You see, my lord," he
said in his ear, "that, if the word 'arrest' was to be once spoken,
it would be soon obeyed, and you are aware your attendants are few for
resistance."Douglas seemed to acquiesce in the necessity of patience for the time."If my teeth," he said, "should bite through my lips, I will be silent
till it is the hour to speak out."George of March, in the meanwhile, had a more easy task of pacifying
the Prince."My Lord of Rothsay," he said, approaching him with grave
ceremony, "I need not tell you that you owe me something for reparation
of honour, though I blame not you personally for the breach of contract
which has destroyed the peace of my family.Let me conjure you, by
what observance your Highness may owe an injured man, to forego for the
present this scandalous dispute.""My lord, I owe you much," replied Rothsay; "but this haughty and all
controlling lord has wounded mine honour.""My lord, I can but add, your royal father is ill--hath swooned with
terror for your Highness's safety."replied the Prince--"the kind, good old man swooned, said you, my
Lord of March?The Duke of Rothsay sprung from his saddle to the ground, and was
dashing into the palace like a greyhound, when a feeble grasp was
laid on his cloak, and the faint voice of a kneeling female exclaimed,
"Protection, my noble prince!--protection for a helpless stranger!"said the Earl of March, thrusting the suppliant
glee maiden aside."It is true," he said, "I have brought
the vengeance of an unforgiving devil upon this helpless creature.what a life, is mine, so fatal to all who approach me!And all my men are
such born reprobates.thou at mine elbow, honest Harry Smith?"There has been something of a fight, my lord," answered our
acquaintance the smith, "between the townsmen and the Southland loons
who ride with the Douglas; and we have swinged them as far as the abbey
gate.""I am glad of it--I am glad of it."Fairly, does your Highness ask?"We were stronger
in numbers, to be sure; but no men ride better armed than those who
follow the Bloody Heart.And so in a sense we beat them fairly; for, as
your Highness knows, it is the smith who makes the man at arms, and men
with good weapons are a match for great odds."While they thus talked, the Earl of March, who had spoken with some one
near the palace gate, returned in anxious haste."My Lord Duke!--my Lord
Duke!your father is recovered, and if you haste not speedily, my Lord
of Albany and the Douglas will have possession of his royal ear.""And if my royal father is recovered," said the thoughtless Prince, "and
is holding, or about to hold, counsel with my gracious uncle and the
Earl of Douglas, it befits neither your lordship nor me to intrude till
we are summoned.So there is time for me to speak of my little business
with mine honest armourer here."said the Earl, whose sanguine hopes of
a change of favour at court had been too hastily excited, and were as
speedily checked."Then so let it be for George of Dunbar."He glided away with a gloomy and displeased aspect; and thus out of the
two most powerful noblemen in Scotland, at a time when the aristocracy
so closely controlled the throne, the reckless heir apparent had made
two enemies--the one by scornful defiance and the other by careless
neglect.He heeded not the Earl of March's departure, however, or rather
he felt relieved from his importunity.The Prince went on in indolent conversation with our armourer, whose
skill in his art had made him personally known to many of the great
lords about the court."I had something to say to thee, Smith.Canst thou take up a fallen link
in my Milan hauberk?""As well, please your Highness, as my mother could take up a stitch in
the nets she wove.The Milaner shall not know my work from his own.""Well, but that was not what I wished of thee just now," said the
Prince, recollecting himself: "this poor glee woman, good Smith,
she must be placed in safety.Thou art man enough to be any woman's
champion, and thou must conduct her to some place of safety."Henry Smith was, as we have seen, sufficiently rash and daring when
weapons were in question.But he had also the pride of a decent burgher,
and was unwilling to place himself in what might be thought equivocal
circumstances by the sober part of his fellow citizens."May it please your Highness," he said, "I am but a poor craftsman.But,
though my arm and sword are at the King's service and your Highness's,
I am, with reverence, no squire of dames.Your Highness will find, among
your own retinue, knights and lords willing enough to play Sir Pandarus
of Troy; it is too knightly a part for poor Hal of the Wynd.""True--true, I gave it to the poor wench.I know enough
of your craft, sir smith, and of craftsmen in general, to be aware that
men lure not hawks with empty hands; but I suppose my word may pass for
the price of a good armour, and I will pay it thee, with thanks to boot,
for this slight service.""Your Highness may know other craftsmen," said the smith; "but, with
reverence, you know not Henry Gow.He will obey you in making a weapon,
or in wielding one, but he knows nothing of this petticoat service.""Hark thee, thou Perthshire mule," said the Prince, yet smiling, while
he spoke, at the sturdy punctilio of the honest burgher; "the wench is
as little to me as she is to thee.But in an idle moment, as you may
learn from those about thee, if thou sawest it not thyself, I did her a
passing grace, which is likely to cost the poor wretch her life.There
is no one here whom I can trust to protect her against the discipline of
belt and bowstring, with which the Border brutes who follow Douglas will
beat her to death, since such is his pleasure.""If such be the case, my liege, she has a right to every honest man's
protection; and since she wears a petticoat--though I would it were
longer and of a less fanciful fashion--I will answer for her protection
as well as a single man may."Good faith, I cannot tell," said the Prince."Take her to Sir John
Ramorny's lodging.But, no--no--he is ill at ease, and besides, there
are reasons; take her to the devil if thou wilt, but place her in
safety, and oblige David of Rothsay.""My noble Prince," said the smith, "I think, always with reverence, that
I would rather give a defenceless woman to the care of the devil than of
Sir John Ramorny.But though the devil be a worker in fire like myself,
yet I know not his haunts, and with aid of Holy Church hope to keep him
on terms of defiance.And, moreover, how I am to convey her out of this
crowd, or through the streets, in such a mumming habit may be well made
a question.""For the leaving the convent," said the Prince, "this good monk"
(seizing upon the nearest by his cowl)--"Father Nicholas or Boniface--"

"Poor brother Cyprian, at your Highness's command," said the father."Ay--ay, brother Cyprian," continued the Prince--"yes.Brother Cyprian
shall let you out at some secret passage which he knows of, and I will
see him again to pay a prince's thanks for it."The churchman bowed in acquiescence, and poor Louise, who, during this
debate, had looked from the one speaker to the other, hastily said, "I
will not scandalise this good man with my foolish garb: I have a mantle
for ordinary wear.""Why, there, Smith, thou hast a friar's hood and a woman's mantle to
shroud thee under.I would all my frailties were as well shrouded.Farewell, honest fellow; I will thank thee hereafter."Then, as if afraid of farther objection on the smith's part, he hastened
into the palace.Henry Gow remained stupefied at what had passed, and at finding himself
involved in a charge at once inferring much danger and an equal risk
of scandal, both which, joined to a principal share which he had taken,
with his usual forwardness, in the fray, might, he saw, do him no small
injury in the suit he pursued most anxiously.At the same time, to leave
a defenceless creature to the ill usage of the barbarous Galwegians and
licentious followers of the Douglas was a thought which his manly heart
could not brook for an instant.He was roused from his reverie by the voice of the monk, who, sliding
out his words with the indifference which the holy fathers entertained,
or affected, towards all temporal matters, desired them to follow him.The smith put himself in motion, with a sigh much resembling a groan,
and, without appearing exactly connected with the monk's motions, he
followed him into a cloister, and through a postern door, which, after
looking once behind him, the priest left ajar.Behind them followed
Louise, who had hastily assumed her small bundle, and, calling her
little four legged companion, had eagerly followed in the path which
opened an escape from what had shortly before seemed a great and
inevitable danger.Then up and spak the auld gudewife,
     And wow!but she was grim:
     "Had e'er your father done the like,
     It had been ill for him."The party were now, by a secret passage, admitted within the church, the
outward doors of which, usually left open, had been closed against
every one in consequence of the recent tumult, when the rioters of both
parties had endeavoured to rush into it for other purposes than those of
devotion.They traversed the gloomy aisles, whose arched roof resounded
to the heavy tread of the armourer, but was silent under the sandalled
foot of the monk, and the light step of poor Louise, who trembled
excessively, as much from fear as cold.She saw that neither her
spiritual nor temporal conductor looked kindly upon her.The former was
an austere man, whose aspect seemed to hold the luckless wanderer in
some degree of horror, as well as contempt; while the latter, though, as
we have seen, one of the best natured men living, was at present grave
to the pitch of sternness, and not a little displeased with having the
part he was playing forced upon him, without, as he was constrained to
feel, a possibility of his declining it.His dislike at his task extended itself to the innocent object of
his protection, and he internally said to himself, as he surveyed her
scornfully: "A proper queen of beggars to walk the streets of Perth
with, and I a decent burgher!This tawdry minion must have as ragged
a reputation as the rest of her sisterhood, and I am finely sped if
my chivalry in her behalf comes to Catharine's ears.I had better have
slain a man, were he the best in Perth; and, by hammer and nails, I
would have done it on provocation, rather than convoy this baggage
through the city."Perhaps Louise suspected the cause of her conductor's anxiety, for she
said, timidly and with hesitation: "Worthy sir, were it not better I
should stop one instant in that chapel and don my mantle?""Umph, sweetheart, well proposed," said the armourer; but the monk
interfered, raising at the same time the finger of interdiction.Madox is no tiring room for jugglers and
strollers to shift their trappings in.I will presently show thee a
vestiary more suited to thy condition."The poor young woman hung down her humbled head, and turned from
the chapel door which she had approached with the deep sense of self
abasement.Her little spaniel seemed to gather from his mistress's looks
and manner that they were unauthorised intruders on the holy ground
which they trode, and hung his ears, and swept the pavement with his
tail, as he trotted slowly and close to Louise's heels.They descended a broad flight of
steps, and proceeded through a labyrinth of subterranean passages, dimly
lighted.As they passed a low arched door, the monk turned and said
to Louise, with the same stern voice as before: "There, daughter of
folly--there is a robing room, where many before you have deposited
their vestments."Obeying the least signal with ready and timorous acquiescence, she
pushed the door open, but instantly recoiled with terror.It was a
charnel house, half filled with dry skulls and bones."I fear to change my dress there, and alone.But, if you, father,
command it, be it as you will.""Why, thou child of vanity, the remains on which thou lookest are but
the earthly attire of those who, in their day, led or followed in the
pursuit of worldly pleasure.And such shalt thou be, for all thy mincing
and ambling, thy piping and thy harping--thou, and all such ministers of
frivolous and worldly pleasure, must become like these poor bones, whom
thy idle nicety fears and loathes to look upon.""Say not with idle nicety, reverend father," answered the glee maiden,
"for, Heaven knows, I covet the repose of these poor bleached relics;
and if, by stretching my body upon them, I could, without sin, bring my
state to theirs, I would choose that charnel heap for my place of rest
beyond the fairest and softest couch in Scotland.""Be patient, and come on," said the monk, in a milder tone, "the reaper
must not leave the harvest work till sunset gives the signal that the
day's toil is over."Brother Cyprian, at the end of a long gallery,
opened the door of a small apartment, or perhaps a chapel, for it was
decorated with a crucifix, before which burned four lamps.All bent and
crossed themselves; and the priest said to the minstrel maiden, pointing
to the crucifix, "What says that emblem?""That HE invites the sinner as well as the righteous to approach.""Ay, if the sinner put from him his sin," said the monk, whose tone of
voice was evidently milder."Prepare thyself here for thy journey."Louise remained an instant or two in the chapel, and presently
reappeared in a mantle of coarse grey cloth, in which she had closely
muffled herself, having put such of her more gaudy habiliments as she
had time to take off in the little basket which had before held her
ordinary attire.The monk presently afterwards unlocked a door which led to the open air.They found themselves in the garden which surrounded the monastery of
the Dominicans."The southern gate is on the latch, and through it you can pass
unnoticed," said the monk."Bless thee, my son; and bless thee too,
unhappy child.Remembering where you put off your idle trinkets, may you
take care how you again resume them!"said Louise, "if the poor foreigner could supply the
mere wants of life by any more creditable occupation, she has small wish
to profess her idle art.But--"

But the monk had vanished; nay, the very door though which she had just
passed appeared to have vanished also, so curiously was it concealed
beneath a flying buttress, and among the profuse ornaments of Gothic
architecture."Here is a woman let out by this private postern, sure enough," was
Henry's reflection."Pray Heaven the good fathers never let any in!The
place seems convenient for such games at bo peep.But, Benedicite, what
is to be done next?I must get rid of this quean as fast as I can; and
I must see her safe.For let her be at heart what she may, she looks too
modest, now she is in decent dress, to deserve the usage which the wild
Scot of Galloway, or the devil's legion from the Liddel, are like to
afford her."Louise stood as if she waited his pleasure which way to go.Her little
dog, relieved by the exchange of the dark, subterranean vault for the
open air, sprung in wild gambols through the walks, and jumped upon its
mistress, and even, though more timidly, circled close round the smith's
feet, to express its satisfaction to him also, and conciliate his
favour."You are glad to get
into the blessed sunshine; but where shall we rest at night, my poor
Charlot?""And now, mistress," said the smith, not churlishly, for it was not in
his nature, but bluntly, as one who is desirous to finish a disagreeable
employment, "which way lies your road?"Louise looked on the ground and was silent.On being again urged to say
which way she desired to be conducted, she again looked down, and said
she could not tell."Come--come," said Henry, "I understand all that: I have been a
galliard--a reveller in my day, but it's best to be plain.As matters
are with me now, I am an altered man for these many, many months; and
so, my quean, you and I must part sooner than perhaps a light o' love
such as you expected to part with--a likely young fellow."Louise wept silently, with her eyes still cast on the ground, as one
who felt an insult which she had not a right to complain of.At length,
perceiving that her conductor was grown impatient, she faltered out,
"Noble sir--"

"Sir is for a knight," said the impatient burgher, "and noble is for
a baron.I am Harry of the Wynd, an honest mechanic, and free of my
guild.""Good craftsman, then," said the minstrel woman, "you judge me harshly,
but not without seeming cause.I would relieve you immediately of my
company, which, it may be, brings little credit to good men, did I but
know which way to go.""To the next wake or fair, to be sure," said Henry, roughly, having no
doubt that this distress was affected for the purpose of palming
herself upon him, and perhaps dreading to throw himself into the way
of temptation; "and that is the feast of St.Madox, at Auchterarder.I
warrant thou wilt find the way thither well enough.""Aftr--Auchter--" repeated the glee maiden, her Southern tongue in vain
attempting the Celtic accentuation."I am told my poor plays will not be
understood if I go nearer to yon dreadful range of mountains.""Will you abide, then, in Perth?""You know where
you came from, surely, though you seem doubtful where you are going?""I slept in the hospital of the convent.But I was only admitted upon
great importunity, and I was commanded not to return.""Nay, they will never take you in with the ban of the Douglas upon you,
that is even too true.But the Prince mentioned Sir John Ramorny's; I
can take you to his lodgings through bye streets, though it is short of
an honest burgher's office, and my time presses.""I will go anywhere; I know I am a scandal and incumbrance.There was a
time when it was otherwise.But this Ramorny, who is he?""A courtly knight, who lives a jolly bachelor's life, and is master of
the horse, and privado, as they say, to the young prince."to the wild, scornful young man who gave occasion to yonder
scandal?Oh, take me not thither, good friend.Is there no Christian
woman who would give a poor creature rest in her cowhouse or barn for
one night?I have gold; and I will repay you, too, if you will take me where I may
be safe from that wild reveller, and from the followers of that dark
baron, in whose eye was death.""Keep your gold for those who lack it, mistress," said Henry, "and
do not offer to honest hands the money that is won by violing, and
tabouring, and toe tripping, and perhaps worse pastimes.I tell you
plainly, mistress, I am not to be fooled.I am ready to take you to any
place of safety you can name, for my promise is as strong as an iron
shackle.But you cannot persuade me that you do not know what earth to
make for.You are not so young in your trade as not to know there are
hostelries in every town, much more in a city like Perth, where such as
you may be harboured for your money, if you cannot find some gulls, more
or fewer, to pay your lawing.If you have money, mistress, my care about
you need be the less; and truly I see little but pretence in all
that excessive grief, and fear of being left alone, in one of your
occupation."Having thus, as he conceived, signified that he was not to be deceived
by the ordinary arts of a glee maiden, Henry walked a few paces
sturdily, endeavouring to think he was doing the wisest and most prudent
thing in the world.Yet he could not help looking back to see how Louise
bore his departure, and was shocked to observe that she had sunk upon a
bank, with her arms resting on her knees and her head on her arms, in a
situation expressive of the utmost desolation.The smith tried to harden his heart."It is all a sham," he said: "the
gouge knows her trade, I'll be sworn, by St.At the instant something pulled the skirts of his cloak; and looking
round, he saw the little spaniel, who immediately, as if to plead his
mistress's cause, got on his hind legs and began to dance, whimpering at
the same time, and looking back to Louise, as if to solicit compassion
for his forsaken owner."Poor thing," said the smith, "there may be a trick in this too, for
thou dost but as thou art taught.Yet, as I promised to protect this
poor creature, I must not leave her in a swoon, if it be one, were it
but for manhood's sake."Returning, and approaching his troublesome charge, he was at once
assured, from the change of her complexion, either that she was actually
in the deepest distress, or had a power of dissimulation beyond the
comprehension of man--or woman either."Young woman," he said, with more of kindness than he had hitherto been
able even to assume, "I will tell you frankly how I am placed.Valentine's Day, and by custom I was to spend it with my fair
Valentine.But blows and quarrels have occupied all the morning, save
one poor half hour.Now, you may well understand where my heart and my
thoughts are, and where, were it only in mere courtesy, my body ought to
be."The glee maiden listened, and appeared to comprehend him."If you are a true lover, and have to wait upon a chaste Valentine, God
forbid that one like me should make a disturbance between you!I will ask of that great river to be my guide to where
it meets the ocean, where I think they said there was a seaport; I will
sail from thence to La Belle France, and will find myself once more in
a country in which the roughest peasant would not wrong the poorest
female.""You cannot go to Dundee today," said the smith."The Douglas people are
in motion on both sides of the river, for the alarm of the morning has
reached them ere now; and all this day, and the next, and the whole
night which is between, they will gather to their leader's standard,
like Highlandmen at the fiery cross.Do you see yonder five or six
men who are riding so wildly on the other side of the river?These are
Annandale men: I know them by the length of their lances, and by the way
they hold them.An Annandale man never <DW72>s his spear backwards, but
always keeps the point upright, or pointed forward.""They are men at arms and
soldiers.They would respect me for my viol and my helplessness.""I will say them no scandal," answered the smith."If you were in their
own glens, they would use you hospitably, and you would have nothing to
fear; but they are now on an expedition.All is fish that comes to their
net.There are amongst them who would take your life for the value of
your gold earrings.Their whole soul is settled in their eyes to see
prey, and in their hands to grasp it.They have no ears either to hear
lays of music or listen to prayers for mercy.Besides, their leader's
order is gone forth concerning you, and it is of a kind sure to be
obeyed.Ay, great lords are sooner listened to if they say, 'Burn a
church,' than if they say, 'Build one.'""Then," said the glee woman, "I were best sit down and die.""Do not say so," replied the smith."If I could but get you a lodging
for the night, I would carry you the next morning to Our Lady's Stairs,
from whence the vessels go down the river for Dundee, and would put you
on board with some one bound that way, who should see you safely lodged
where you would have fair entertainment and kind usage.""Good--excellent--generous man!"said the glee maiden, "do this, and
if the prayers and blessings of a poor unfortunate should ever reach
Heaven, they will rise thither in thy behalf.We will meet at yonder
postern door, at whatever time the boats take their departure.""That is at six in the morning, when the day is but young.""Away with you, then, to your Valentine; and if she loves you, oh,
deceive her not!"I fear it is deceit hath brought thee to this pass.But I must not leave you thus unprovided.I must know where you are to
pass the night.""Care not for that," replied Louise: "the heavens are clear--there are
bushes and boskets enough by the river side--Charlot and I can well make
a sleeping room of a green arbour for one night; and tomorrow will,
with your promised aid, see me out of reach of injury and wrong.Oh,
the night soon passes away when there is hope for tomorrow!Do you still
linger, with your Valentine waiting for you?Nay, I shall hold you but a
loitering lover, and you know what belongs to a minstrel's reproaches.""I cannot leave you, damsel," answered the armourer, now completely
melted."It were mere murder to suffer you to pass the night exposed to
the keenness of a Scottish blast in February.No--no, my word would be
ill kept in this manner; and if I should incur some risk of blame, it is
but just penance for thinking of thee, and using thee, more according to
my own prejudices, as I now well believe, than thy merits.Come with
me, damsel; thou shalt have a sure and honest lodging for the night,
whatsoever may be the consequence.It would be an evil compliment to my
Catharine, were I to leave a poor creature to be starved to death, that
I might enjoy her company an hour sooner."So saying, and hardening himself against all anticipations of the ill
consequences or scandal which might arise from such a measure, the manly
hearted smith resolved to set evil report at defiance, and give the
wanderer a night's refuge in his own house.It must be added, that
he did this with extreme reluctance, and in a sort of enthusiasm of
benevolence.Ere our stout son of Vulcan had fixed his worship on the Fair Maid of
Perth, a certain natural wildness of disposition had placed him under
the influence of Venus, as well as that of Mars; and it was only the
effect of a sincere attachment which had withdrawn him entirely from
such licentious pleasures.He was therefore justly jealous of his
newly acquired reputation for constancy, which his conduct to this
poor wanderer must expose to suspicion; a little doubtful, perhaps, of
exposing himself too venturously to temptation; and moreover in despair
to lose so much of St.Valentine's Day, which custom not only permitted,
but enjoined him to pass beside his mate for the season.The journey to
Kinfauns, and the various transactions which followed, had consumed the
day, and it was now nearly evensong time.As if to make up by a speedy pace for the time he was compelled to waste
upon a subject so foreign to that which he had most at heart, he strode
on through the Dominicans' gardens, entered the town, and casting his
cloak around the lower part of his face, and pulling down his bonnet to
conceal the upper, he continued the same celerity of movement through
bye streets and lanes, hoping to reach his own house in the Wynd without
being observed.But when he had continued his rate of walking for ten
minutes, he began to be sensible it might be too rapid for the young
woman to keep up with him.He accordingly looked behind him with a
degree of angry impatience, which soon turned into compunction, when
he saw that she was almost utterly exhausted by the speed which she had
exerted."Now, marry, hang me up for a brute," said Henry to himself."Was my
own haste ever so great, could it give that poor creature wings?I am an ill nurtured beast, that is certain,
wherever women are in question; and always sure to do wrong when I have
the best will to act right."Hark thee, damsel; let me carry these things for thee.We shall make
better speed that I do so."Poor Louise would have objected, but her breath was too much exhausted
to express herself; and she permitted her good natured guardian to take
her little basket, which, when the dog beheld, he came straight before
Henry, stood up, and shook his fore paws, whining gently, as if he too
wanted to be carried."Nay, then, I must needs lend thee a lift too," said the smith, who saw
the creature was tired:

"Fie, Charlot!"said Louise; "thou knowest I will carry thee myself."She endeavoured to take up the little spaniel, but it escaped from her;
and going to the other side of the smith, renewed its supplication that
he would take it up."Charlot's right," said the smith: "he knows best who is ablest to bear
him.This lets me know, my pretty one, that you have not been always the
bearer of your own mail: Charlot can tell tales."So deadly a hue came across the poor glee maiden's countenance as Henry
spoke, that he was obliged to support her, lest she should have dropped
to the ground.She recovered again, however, in an instant or two, and
with a feeble voice requested her guide would go on."Nay--nay," said Henry, as they began to move, "keep hold of my cloak,
or my arm, if it helps you forward better.A fair sight we are; and had
I but a rebeck or a guitar at my back, and a jackanapes on my shoulder,
we should seem as joyous a brace of strollers as ever touched string at
a castle gate.he ejaculated internally, "were any neighbour to meet me with
this little harlotry's basket at my back, her dog under my arm, and
herself hanging on my cloak, what could they think but that I had turned
mumper in good earnest?I would not for the best harness I ever laid
hammer on, that any of our long tongued neighbours met me in this guise;
it were a jest would last from St.Valentine's Day to next Candlemas."Stirred by these thoughts, the smith, although at the risk of making
much longer a route which he wished to traverse as swiftly as possible,
took the most indirect and private course which he could find, in order
to avoid the main streets, still crowded with people, owing to the late
scene of tumult and agitation.But unhappily his policy availed him
nothing; for, in turning into an alley, he met a man with his cloak
muffled around his face, from a desire like his own to pass unobserved,
though the slight insignificant figure, the spindle shanks, which showed
themselves beneath the mantle, and the small dull eye that blinked over
its upper folds, announced the pottingar as distinctly as if he had
carried his sign in front of his bonnet.His unexpected and most
unwelcome presence overwhelmed the smith with confusion.Ready evasion
was not the property of his bold, blunt temper; and knowing this man
to be a curious observer, a malignant tale bearer, and by no means well
disposed to himself in particular, no better hope occurred to him than
that the worshipful apothecary would give him some pretext to silence
his testimony and secure his discretion by twisting his neck round.But, far from doing or saying anything which could warrant such
extremities, the pottingar, seeing himself so close upon his stalwart
townsman that recognition was inevitable, seemed determined it should
be as slight as possible; and without appearing to notice anything
particular in the company or circumstances in which they met, he barely
slid out these words as he passed him, without even a glance towards his
companion after the first instant of their meeting: "A merry holiday to
you once more, stout smith.thou art bringing thy cousin, pretty
Mistress Joan Letham, with her mail, from the waterside--fresh from
Dundee, I warrant?I heard she was expected at the old cordwainer's."As he spoke thus, he looked neither right nor left, and exchanging
a "Save you!"with a salute of the same kind which the smith rather
muttered than uttered distinctly, he glided forward on his way like a
shadow."The foul fiend catch me, if I can swallow that pill," said Henry Smith,
"how well soever it may be gilded.The knave has a shrewd eye for a
kirtle, and knows a wild duck from a tame as well as e'er a man in
Perth.He were the last in the Fair City to take sour plums for pears,
or my roundabout cousin Joan for this piece of fantastic vanity.I fancy
his bearing was as much as to say, 'I will not see what you might wish
me blind to'; and he is right to do so, as he might easily purchase
himself a broken pate by meddling with my matters, and so he will be
silent for his own sake.Dunstan, the
chattering, bragging, cowardly knave, Oliver Proudfute!"It was, indeed, the bold bonnet maker whom they next encountered, who,
with his cap on one side, and trolling the ditty of--

     "Thou art over long at the pot, Tom, Tom,"
--gave plain intimation that he had made no dry meal.my jolly smith," he said, "have I caught thee in the manner?Can Vulcan, as the minstrel says, pay Venus
back in her own coin?Faith, thou wilt be a gay Valentine before the
year's out, that begins with the holiday so jollily.""Hark ye, Oliver," said the displeased smith, "shut your eyes and pass
on, crony.And hark ye again, stir not your tongue about what concerns
you not, as you value having an entire tooth in your head."I bear tales, and that against my brother martialist?I would not tell it even to my timber soldan!Why, I can be a wild
galliard in a corner as well as thou, man.And now I think on't, I
will go with thee somewhere, and we will have a rouse together, and thy
Dalilah shall give us a song."Excellently," said Henry, longing the whole time to knock his brother
martialist down, but wisely taking a more peaceful way to rid himself of
the incumbrance of his presence--"excellently well!I may want thy help,
too, for here are five or six of the Douglasses before us: they will not
fail to try to take the wench from a poor burgher like myself, so I will
be glad of the assistance of a tearer such as thou art.""I thank ye--I thank ye," answered the bonnet maker; "but were I not
better run and cause ring the common bell, and get my great sword?""Ay, ay, run home as fast as you can, and say nothing of what you have
seen."This put life and mettle into the heels of the bonnet maker, who,
turning his back on the supposed danger, set off at a pace which the
smith never doubted would speedily bring him to his own house."Here is another chattering jay to deal with," thought the smith; "but
I have a hank over him too.The minstrels have a fabliau of a daw
with borrowed feathers--why, this Oliver is The very bird, and, by St.Dunstan, if he lets his chattering tongue run on at my expense, I will
so pluck him as never hawk plumed a partridge.As these reflections thronged on his mind, he had nearly reached the end
of his journey, and, with the glee maiden still hanging on his cloak,
exhausted, partly with fear, partly with fatigue, he at length arrived
at the middle of the wynd, which was honoured with his own habitation,
and from which, in the uncertainty that then attended the application
of surnames, he derived one of his own appellatives.Here, on ordinary
days, his furnace was seen to blaze, and four half stripped knaves
stunned the neighbourhood with the clang of hammer and stithy.Valentine's holiday was an excuse for these men of steel having shut the
shop, and for the present being absent on their own errands of devotion
or pleasure.The house which adjoined to the smithy called Henry its
owner; and though it was small, and situated in a narrow street, yet, as
there was a large garden with fruit trees behind it, it constituted
upon the whole a pleasant dwelling.The smith, instead of knocking or
calling, which would have drawn neighbours to doors and windows,
drew out a pass key of his own fabrication, then a great and envied
curiosity, and opening the door of his house, introduced his companion
into his habitation.The apartment which received Henry and the glee maiden was the kitchen,
which served amongst those of the smith's station for the family sitting
room, although one or two individuals, like Simon Glover, had an eating
room apart from that in which their victuals were prepared.In the
corner of this apartment, which was arranged with an unusual attention
to cleanliness, sat an old woman, whose neatness of attire, and the
precision with which her scarlet plaid was drawn over her head, so as
to descend to her shoulders on each side, might have indicated a higher
rank than that of Luckie Shoolbred, the smith's housekeeper.Yet such
and no other was her designation; and not having attended mass in the
morning, she was quietly reposing herself by the side of the fire, her
beads, half told, hanging over her left arm; her prayers, half said,
loitering upon her tongue; her eyes, half closed, resigning themselves
to slumber, while she expected the return of her foster son, without
being able to guess at what hour it was likely to happen.She started
up at the sound of his entrance, and bent her eye upon his companion, at
first with a look of the utmost surprise, which gradually was exchanged
for one expressive of great displeasure."Now the saints bless mine eyesight, Henry Smith!"Get some food ready presently, good nurse, for
I fear me this traveller hath dined but lightly.""And again I pray that Our Lady would preserve my eyesight from the
wicked delusions of Satan!""So be it, I tell you, good woman.But what is the use of all this
pattering and prayering?or will you not do as I bid
you?""It must be himself, then, whatever is of it!it is more like
the foul fiend in his likeness, to have such a baggage hanging upon his
cloak.Oh, Harry Smith, men called you a wild lad for less things; but
who would ever have thought that Harry would have brought a light leman
under the roof that sheltered his worthy mother, and where his own nurse
has dwelt for thirty years?""Hold your peace, old woman, and be reasonable," said the smith."This
glee woman is no leman of mine, nor of any other person that I know of;
but she is going off for Dundee tomorrow by the boats, and we must give
her quarters till then.""You may give quarters to such cattle if
you like it yourself, Harry Wynd; but the same house shall not quarter
that trumpery quean and me, and of that you may assure yourself.""Your mother is angry with me," said Louise, misconstruing the connexion
of the parties."I will not remain to give her any offence.If there is
a stable or a cowhouse, an empty stall will be bed enough for Charlot
and me.""Ay--ay, I am thinking it is the quarters you are best used to," said
Dame Shoolbred."Harkye, Nurse Shoolbred," said the smith."You know I love you for your
own sake and for my mother's; but by St.Dunstan, who was a saint of my
own craft, I will have the command of my own house; and if you leave me
without any better reason but your own nonsensical suspicions, you must
think how you will have the door open to you when you return; for you
shall have no help of mine, I promise you.""Aweel, my bairn, and that will never make me risk the honest name I
have kept for sixty years.It was never your mother's custom, and it
shall never be mine, to take up with ranters, and jugglers, and singing
women; and I am not so far to seek for a dwelling, that the same roof
should cover me and a tramping princess like that."With this the refractory gouvernante began in great hurry to adjust her
tartan mantle for going abroad, by pulling it so forwards as to conceal
the white linen cap, the edges of which bordered her shrivelled but
still fresh and healthful countenance.This done, she seized upon a
staff, the trusty companion of her journeys, and was fairly trudging
towards the door, when the smith stepped between her and the passage."Wait at least, old woman, till we have cleared scores.I owe you for
fee and bountith.""An' that's e'en a dream of your own fool's head.What fee or bountith
am I to take from the son of your mother, that fed, clad, and bielded me
as if I had been a sister?""And well you repay it, nurse, leaving her only child at his utmost
need."This seemed to strike the obstinate old woman with compunction.She
stopped and looked at her master and the minstrel alternately; then
shook her head, and seemed about to resume her motion towards the door."I only receive this poor wanderer under my roof," urged the smith, "to
save her from the prison and the scourge.""I
dare say she has deserved them both as well as ever thief deserved a
hempen collar.""For aught I know she may or she may not.But she cannot deserve to be
scourged to death, or imprisoned till she is starved to death; and that
is the lot of them that the Black Douglas bears mal-talent against.""And you are going to thraw the Black Douglas for the cake of a glee
woman?This will be the worst of your feuds yet.Oh, Henry Gow, there is
as much iron in your head as in your anvil!""I have sometimes thought this myself; Mistress Shoolbred; but if I do
get a cut or two on this new argument, I wonder who is to cure them, if
you run away from me like a scared wild goose?Ay, and, moreover, who is
to receive my bonny bride, that I hope to bring up the wynd one of these
days?""Ah, Harry--Harry," said the old woman, shaking her head, "this is not
the way to prepare an honest man's house for a young bride: you
should be guided by modesty and discretion, and not by chambering and
wantonness.""I tell you again, this poor creature is nothing to me.I wish her only
to be safely taken care of; and I think the boldest Borderman in Perth
will respect the bar of my door as much as the gate of Carlisle Castle.I am going down to Sim Glover's; I may stay there all night, for the
Highland cub is run back to the hills, like a wolf whelp as he is, and
so there is a bed to spare, and father Simon will make me welcome to
the use of it.You will remain with this poor creature, feed her, and
protect her during the night, and I will call on her before day; and
thou mayst go with her to the boat thyself an thou wilt, and so thou
wilt set the last eyes on her at the same time I shall.""There is some reason in that," said Dame Shoolbred; "though why you
should put your reputation in risk for a creature that would find a
lodging for a silver twopence and less matter is a mystery to me.""Trust me with that, old woman, and be kind to the girl.""Kinder than she deserves, I warrant you; and truly, though I little
like the company of such cattle, yet I think I am less like to take harm
from her than you--unless she be a witch, indeed, which may well come
to be the case, as the devil is very powerful with all this wayfaring
clanjamfray.""No more a witch than I am a warlock," said the honest smith: "a poor,
broken hearted thing, that, if she hath done evil, has dreed a sore
weird for it.And you, my musical damsel, I will call
on you tomorrow morning, and carry you to the waterside.This old woman
will treat you kindly if you say nothing to her but what becomes honest
ears."The poor minstrel had listened to this dialogue without understanding
more than its general tendency; for, though she spoke English well, she
had acquired the language in England itself; and the Northern dialect
was then, as now, of a broader and harsher character.She saw, however,
that she was to remain with the old lady, and meekly folding her arms
on her bosom, bent her head with humility.She next looked towards the
smith with a strong expression of thankfulness, then, raising her eyes
to heaven, took his passive hand, and seemed about to kiss the sinewy
fingers in token of deep and affectionate gratitude.But Dame Shoolbred did not give license to the stranger's mode of
expressing her feelings.She thrust in between them, and pushing poor
Louise aside, said, "No--no, I'll have none of that work.Go into the
chimney nook, mistress, and when Harry Smith's gone, if you must have
hands to kiss, you shall kiss mine as long as you like.And you, Harry,
away down to Sim Glover's, for if pretty Mistress Catharine hears of the
company you have brought home, she may chance to like them as little
as I do.are you going out
without your buckler, and the whole town in misrule?""You are right, dame," said the armourer; and, throwing the buckler over
his broad shoulders, he departed from his house without abiding farther
question.How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills,
     Savage and shrill!But with the breath which fills
     Their mountain pipe, so fill the mountaineers
     With the fierce native daring which instils
     The stirring memory of a thousand years.We must now leave the lower parties in our historical drama, to attend
to the incidents which took place among those of a higher rank and
greater importance.We pass from the hut of an armourer to the council room of a monarch,
and resume our story just when, the tumult beneath being settled, the
angry chieftains were summoned to the royal presence.They entered,
displeased with and lowering upon each other, each so exclusively filled
with his own fancied injuries as to be equally unwilling and unable
to attend to reason or argument.Albany alone, calm and crafty, seemed
prepared to use their dissatisfaction for his own purposes, and turn
each incident as it should occur to the furtherance of his own indirect
ends.The King's irresolution, although it amounted even to timidity, did not
prevent his assuming the exterior bearing becoming his situation.It
was only when hard pressed, as in the preceding scene, that he lost his
apparent composure.In general, he might be driven from his purpose, but
seldom from his dignity of manner.He received Albany, Douglas, March,
and the prior, those ill assorted members of his motley council, with a
mixture of courtesy and loftiness, which reminded each haughty peer that
he stood in the presence of his sovereign, and compelled him to do the
beseeming reverence.Having received their salutations, the King motioned them to be seated;
and they were obeying his commands when Rothsay entered.He walked
gracefully up to his father, and, kneeling at his footstool, requested
his blessing.Robert, with an aspect in which fondness and sorrow were
ill disguised, made an attempt to assume a look of reproof, as he laid
his hand on the youth's head and said, with a sigh, "God bless thee, my
thoughtless boy, and make thee a wiser man in thy future years!"said Rothsay, in a tone of feeling such as
his happier moments often evinced.He then kissed the royal hand, with
the reverence of a son and a subject; and, instead of taking a place at
the council board, remained standing behind the King's chair, in such a
position that he might, when he chose, whisper into his father's ear.The King next made a sign to the prior of St.Dominic to take his place
at the table, on which there were writing materials, which, of all the
subjects present, Albany excepted, the churchman was alone able to use.The King then opened the purpose of their meeting by saying, with much
dignity:

"Our business, my lords, respected these unhappy dissensions in the
Highlands, which, we learn by our latest messengers, are about to
occasion the waste and destruction of the country, even within a few
miles of this our own court.But, near as this trouble is, our ill fate,
and the instigations of wicked men, have raised up one yet nearer, by
throwing strife and contention among the citizens of Perth and those
attendants who follow your lordships and others our knights and nobles.I must first, therefore, apply to yourselves, my lords, to know why our
court is disturbed by such unseemly contendings, and by what means they
ought to be repressed?Brother of Albany, do you tell us first your
sentiments on this matter.""Sir, our royal sovereign and brother," said the Duke, "being in
attendance on your Grace's person when the fray began, I am not
acquainted with its origin.""And for me," said the Prince, "I heard no worse war cry than a minstrel
wench's ballad, and saw no more dangerous bolts flying than hazel nuts.""And I," said the Earl of March, "could only perceive that the stout
citizens of Perth had in chase some knaves who had assumed the Bloody
Heart on their shoulders.They ran too fast to be actually the men of
the Earl of Douglas."Douglas understood the sneer, but only replied to it by one of those
withering looks with which he was accustomed to intimate his mortal
resentment.He spoke, however, with haughty composure."My liege," he said, "must of course know it is Douglas who must
answer to this heavy charge, for when was there strife or bloodshed
in Scotland, but there were foul tongues to asperse a Douglas or
a Douglas's man as having given cause to them?We have here goodly
witnesses.I speak not of my Lord of Albany, who has only said that he
was, as well becomes him, by your Grace's side.And I say nothing of my
Lord of Rothsay, who, as befits his rank, years, and understanding, was
cracking nuts with a strolling musician.Here he may say his
pleasure; I shall not forget a tie which he seems to have forgotten.But
here is my Lord of March, who saw my followers flying before the clowns
of Perth.I can tell that earl that the followers of the Bloody Heart
advance or retreat when their chieftain commands and the good of
Scotland requires.""And I can answer--" exclaimed the equally proud Earl of March, his
blood rushing into his face, when the King interrupted him.angry lords," said the King, "and remember in whose presence you
stand.And you, my Lord of Douglas, tell us, if you can, the cause of
this mutiny, and why your followers, whose general good services we are
most willing to acknowledge, were thus active in private brawl.""I obey, my lord," said Douglas, slightly stooping a head that seldom
bent."I was passing from my lodgings in the Carthusian convent, through
the High Street of Perth, with a few of my ordinary retinue, when I
beheld some of the baser sort of citizens crowding around the Cross,
against which there was nailed this placard, and that which accompanies
it."He took from a pocket in the bosom of his buff coat a human hand and a
piece of parchment."Read," he said, "good father prior, and let that ghastly spectacle be
removed."The prior read a placard to the following purpose:

"Inasmuch as the house of a citizen of Perth was assaulted last night,
being St.Valentine's Eve, by a sort of disorderly night walkers,
belonging to some company of the strangers now resident in the Fair
City; and whereas this hand was struck from one of the lawless limmers
in the fray that ensued, the provost and magistrates have directed that
it should be nailed to the Cross, in scorn and contempt of those by whom
such brawl was occasioned.And if any one of knightly degree shall say
that this our act is wrongfully done, I, Patrick Charteris of Kinfauns,
knight, will justify this cartel in knightly weapons, within the
barrace; or, if any one of meaner birth shall deny what is here said, he
shall be met with by a citizen of the Fair City of Perth, according to
his degree."You will not wonder, my lord," resumed Douglas, "that, when my almoner
had read to me the contents of so insolent a scroll, I caused one of
my squires to pluck down a trophy so disgraceful to the chivalry and
nobility of Scotland.Where upon, it seems some of these saucy burghers
took license to hoot and insult the hindmost of my train, who wheeled
their horses on them, and would soon have settled the feud, but for
my positive command that they should follow me in as much peace as the
rascally vulgar would permit.And thus they arrived here in the guise
of flying men, when, with my command to repel force by force, they might
have set fire to the four corners of this wretched borough, and stifled
the insolent churls, like malicious fox cubs in a burning brake of
furze."There was a silence when Douglas had done speaking, until the Duke of
Rothsay answered, addressing his father:

"Since the Earl of Douglas possesses the power of burning the town where
your Grace holds your court, so soon as the provost and he differ about
a night riot, or the terms of a cartel, I am sure we ought all to be
thankful that he has not the will to do so.""The Duke of Rothsay," said Douglas, who seemed resolved to maintain
command of his temper, "may have reason to thank Heaven in a more
serious tone than he now uses that the Douglas is as true as he is
powerful.This is a time when the subjects in all countries rise against
the law: we have heard of the insurgents of the Jacquerie in France; and
of Jack Straw, and Hob Miller, and Parson Ball, among the Southron;
and we may be sure there is fuel enough to catch such a flame, were it
spreading to our frontiers.When I see peasants challenging noblemen,
and nailing the hands of the gentry to their city cross, I will not say
I fear mutiny--for that would be false--but I foresee, and will stand
well prepared for, it.""And why does my Lord Douglas say," answered the Earl of March, "that
this cartel has been done by churls?I see Sir Patrick Charteris's name
there, and he, I ween, is of no churl's blood.The Douglas himself,
since he takes the matter so warmly, might lift Sir Patrick's gauntlet
without soiling of his honour.""My Lord of March," replied Douglas, "should speak but of what he
understands.I do no injustice to the descendant of the Red Rover,
when I say he is too slight to be weighed with the Douglas.The heir of
Thomas Randolph might have a better claim to his answer.""And, by my honour, it shall not miss for want of my asking the grace,"
said the Earl of March, pulling his glove off."Stay, my lord," said the King."Do us not so gross an injury as to
bring your feud to mortal defiance here; but rather offer your ungloved
hand in kindness to the noble earl, and embrace in token of your mutual
fealty to the crown of Scotland.""Not so, my liege," answered March; "your Majesty may command me to
return my gauntlet, for that and all the armour it belongs to are
at your command, while I continue to hold my earldom of the crown of
Scotland; but when I clasp Douglas, it must be with a mailed hand.My counsels here avail not, nay, are so unfavourably
received, that perhaps farther stay were unwholesome for my safety.May
God keep your Highness from open enemies and treacherous friends!I am
for my castle of Dunbar, from whence I think you will soon hear news.Farewell to you, my Lords of Albany and Douglas; you are playing a high
game, look you play it fairly.Farewell, poor thoughtless prince, who
art sporting like a fawn within spring of a tiger!Farewell, all--George
of Dunbar sees the evil he cannot remedy.The King would have spoken, but the accents died on his tongue, as he
received from Albany a look cautioning him to forbear.The Earl of March
left the apartment, receiving the mute salutations of the members of the
council whom he had severally addressed, excepting from Douglas alone,
who returned to his farewell speech a glance of contemptuous defiance."The recreant goes to betray us to the Southron," he said; "his pride
rests on his possessing that sea worn hold which can admit the English
into Lothian [the castle of Dunbar].Nay, look not alarmed, my liege, I
will hold good what I say.Speak but the
word, my liege--say but 'Arrest him,' and March shall not yet cross the
Earn on his traitorous journey.""Nay, gallant earl," said Albany, who wished rather that the two
powerful lords should counterbalance each other than that one should
obtain a decisive superiority, "that were too hasty counsel.The Earl of
March came hither on the King's warrant of safe conduct, and it may
not consist with my royal brother's honour to break it.Yet, if your
lordship can bring any detailed proof--"

Here they were interrupted by a flourish of trumpets."His Grace of Albany is unwontedly scrupulous today," said Douglas;
"but it skills not wasting words--the time is past--these are March's
trumpets, and I warrant me he rides at flight speed so soon as he passes
the South Port.We shall hear of him in time; and if it be as I
have conjectured, he shall be met with though all England backed his
treachery.""Nay, let us hope better of the noble earl," said the King, no way
displeased that the quarrel betwixt March and Douglas had seemed to
obliterate the traces of the disagreement betwixt Rothsay and his father
in law; "he hath a fiery, but not a sullen, temper.In some things he
has been--I will not say wronged, but disappointed--and something is to
be allowed to the resentment of high blood armed with great power.But
thank Heaven, all of us who remain are of one sentiment, and, I may say,
of one house; so that, at least, our councils cannot now be thwarted
with disunion.Father prior, I pray you take your writing materials,
for you must as usual be our clerk of council.And now to business,
my lords; and our first object of consideration must be this Highland
cumber.""Between the Clan Chattan and the Clan Quhele," said the prior, "which,
as our last advices from our brethren at Dunkeld inform us, is ready
to break out into a more formidable warfare than has yet taken place
between these sons of Belial, who speak of nothing else than of utterly
destroying one another.Their forces are assembling on each side, and
not a man claiming in the tenth degree of kindred but must repair to the
brattach of his tribe, or stand to the punishment of fire and sword.The fiery cross hath flitted about like a meteor in every direction, and
awakened strange and unknown tribes beyond the distant Moray Firth--may
Heaven and St.But if your lordships cannot
find remedy for evil, it will spread broad and wide, and the patrimony
of the church must in every direction be exposed to the fury of these
Amalekites, with whom there is as little devotion to Heaven as there is
pity or love to their neighbour--may Our Lady be our guard!We hear some
of them are yet utter heathens, and worship Mahound and Termagaunt.""My lords and kinsmen," said Robert, "ye have heard the urgency of this
case, and may desire to know my sentiments before you deliver what your
own wisdom shall suggest.And, in sooth, no better remedy occurs to me
than to send two commissioners, with full power from us to settle such
debates as be among them, and at the same time to charge them, as they
shall be answerable to the law, to lay down their arms, and forbear all
practices of violence against each other.""I approve of your Grace's proposal," said Rothsay; "and I trust the
good prior will not refuse the venerable station of envoy upon
this peacemaking errand.And his reverend brother, the abbot of the
Carthusian convent, must contend for an honour which will certainly
add two most eminent recruits to the large army of martyrs, since the
Highlanders little regard the distinction betwixt clerk and layman in
the ambassadors whom you send to them.""My royal Lord of Rothsay," said the prior, "if I am destined to the
blessed crown of martyrdom, I shall be doubtless directed to the path
by which I am to attain it.Meantime, if you speak in jest, may Heaven
pardon you, and give you light to perceive that it were better buckle
on your arms to guard the possessions of the church, so perilously
endangered, than to employ your wit in taunting her ministers and
servants.""I taunt no one, father prior," said the youth, yawning; "Nor have
I much objection to taking arms, excepting that they are a somewhat
cumbrous garb, and in February a furred mantle is more suiting to the
weather than a steel corselet.And it irks me the more to put on cold
harness in this nipping weather, that, would but the church send a
detachment of their saints--and they have some Highland ones well known
in this district, and doubtless used to the climate--they might fight
their own battles, like merry St.But I know not how
it is, we hear of their miracles when they are propitiated, and of their
vengeance if any one trespasses on their patrimonies, and these are
urged as reasons for extending their lands by large largesses; and yet,
if there come down but a band of twenty Highlanders, bell, book, and
candle make no speed, and the belted baron must be fain to maintain the
church in possession of the lands which he has given to her, as much as
if he himself still enjoyed the fruits of them.""Son David," said the King, "you give an undue license to your tongue.""Nay, Sir, I am mute," replied the Prince."I had no purpose to disturb
your Highness, or displease the father prior, who, with so many miracles
at his disposal, will not face, as it seems, a handful of Highland
caterans.""We know," said the prior, with suppressed indignation, "from what
source these vile doctrines are derived, which we hear with horror from
the tongue that now utters them.When princes converse with heretics,
their minds and manners are alike corrupted.They show themselves in the
streets as the companions of maskers and harlots, and in the council as
the scorners of the church and of holy things.""Rothsay shall make amends for
what he has idly spoken.let us take counsel in friendly fashion,
rather than resemble a mutinous crew of mariners in a sinking vessel,
when each is more intent on quarrelling with his neighbours than in
assisting the exertions of the forlorn master for the safety of the
ship.My Lord of Douglas, your house has been seldom to lack when the
crown of Scotland desired either wise counsel or manly achievement; I
trust you will help us in this strait.""I can only wonder that the strait should exist, my lord," answered
the haughty Douglas."When I was entrusted with the lieutenancy of
the kingdom, there were some of these wild clans came down from the
Grampians.I troubled not the council about the matter, but made the
sheriff, Lord Ruthven, get to horse with the forces of the Carse--the
Hays, the Lindsays, the Ogilvies, and other gentlemen.When it was steel coat to frieze mantle, the thieves knew what lances
were good for, and whether swords had edges or no.There were some
three hundred of their best bonnets, besides that of their chief, Donald
Cormac, left on the moor of Thorn and in Rochinroy Wood; and as many
were gibbeted at Houghmanstares, which has still the name from the
hangman work that was done there.This is the way men deal with thieves
in my country; and if gentler methods will succeed better with these
Earish knaves, do not blame Douglas for speaking his mind.You smile,
my Lord of Rothsay.May I ask how I have a second time become your jest,
before I have replied to the first which you passed on me?""Nay, be not wrathful, my good Lord of Douglas," answered the Prince; "I
did but smile to think how your princely retinue would dwindle if every
thief were dealt with as the poor Highlanders at Houghmanstares."The King again interfered, to prevent the Earl from giving an angry
reply."Your lordship," said he to Douglas, "advises wisely that we should
trust to arms when these men come out against our subjects on the fair
and level plan; but the difficulty is to put a stop to their disorders
while they continue to lurk within their mountains.I need not tell
you that the Clan Chattan and the Clan Quhele are great confederacies,
consisting each of various tribes, who are banded together, each to
support their own separate league, and who of late have had dissensions
which have drawn blood wherever they have met, whether individually or
in bands.The whole country is torn to pieces by their restless feuds.""I cannot see the evil of this," said the Douglas: "the ruffians will
destroy each other, and the deer of the Highlands will increase as
the men diminish.We shall gain as hunters the exercise we lose as
warriors.""Rather say that the wolves will increase as the men diminish," replied
the King."I am content," said Douglas: "better wild wolves than wild caterans.Let there be strong forces maintained along the Earish frontier, to
separate the quiet from the disturbed country.Confine the fire of civil
war within the Highlands; let it spend its uncontrolled fury, and it
will be soon burnt out for want of fuel.The survivors will be humbled,
and will be more obedient to a whisper of your Grace's pleasure
than their fathers, or the knaves that now exist, have, been to your
strictest commands.""This is wise but ungodly counsel," said the prior, shaking his head; "I
cannot take it upon my conscience to recommend it.It is wisdom, but it
is the wisdom of Achitophel, crafty at once and cruel.""My heart tells me so," said the King, laying his hand on his
breast--"my heart tells me that it will be asked of me at the awful day,
'Robert Stuart, where are the subjects I have given thee?'It tells me
that I must account for them all, Saxon and Gael, Lowland, Highland, and
Border man; that I will not be required to answer for those alone who
have wealth and knowledge, but for those also who were robbers because
they were poor, and rebels because they were ignorant.""Your Highness speaks like a Christian king," said the prior; "but you
bear the sword as well as the sceptre, and this present evil is of a
kind which the sword must cure.""Hark ye, my lords," said the Prince, looking up as if a gay thought
had suddenly struck him."Suppose we teach these savage mountaineers
a strain of chivalry?It were no hard matter to bring these two great
commanders, the captain of the Clan Chattan and the chief of the no less
doughty race of the Clan Quhele, to defy each other to mortal combat.They might fight here in Perth--we would lend them horse and armour;
thus their feud would be stanched by the death of one, or probably both,
of the villains, for I think both would break their necks in the first
charge; my father's godly desire of saving blood would be attained; and
we should have the pleasure of seeing such a combat between two savage
knights, for the first time in their lives wearing breeches and mounted
on horses, as has not been heard of since the days of King Arthur.""Do you make the distress of
your native country, and the perplexity of our councils, a subject for
buffoonery?""If you will pardon me, royal brother," said Albany, "I think that,
though my princely nephew hath started this thought in a jocular manner,
there may be something wrought out of it, which might greatly remedy
this pressing evil.""Good brother," replied the King, "it is unkind to expose Rothsay's
folly by pressing further his ill timed jest.We know the Highland clans
have not our customs of chivalry, nor the habit or mode of doing battle
which these require.""True, your Grace," answered Albany; "yet I speak not in scorn, but in
serious earnest.True, the mountaineers have not our forms and mode of
doing battle in the lists, but they have those which are as effectual
to the destruction of human life, and so that the mortal game is played,
and the stake won and lost, what signifies it whether these Gael fight
with sword and lance, as becomes belted knights, or with sandbags, like
the crestless churls of England, or butcher each other with knives and
skenes, in their own barbarous fashion?Their habits, like our own,
refer all disputed rights and claims to the decision of battle.They
are as vain, too, as they are fierce; and the idea that these two clans
would be admitted to combat in presence of your Grace and of your
court will readily induce them to refer their difference to the fate of
battle, even were such rough arbitrement less familiar to their customs,
and that in any such numbers as shall be thought most convenient.We
must take care that they approach not the court, save in such a fashion
and number that they shall not be able to surprise us; and that point
being provided against, the more that shall be admitted to combat upon
either side, the greater will be the slaughter among their bravest and
most stirring men, and the more the chance of the Highlands being quiet
for some time to come.""This were a bloody policy, brother," said the King; "and again I say,
that I cannot bring my conscience to countenance the slaughter of these
rude men, that are so little better than so many benighted heathens.""And are their lives more precious," asked Albany, "than those of nobles
and gentlemen who by your Grace's license are so frequently admitted to
fight in barrace, either for the satisfying of disputes at law or simply
to acquire honour?"The King, thus hard pressed, had little to say against a custom so
engrafted upon the laws of the realm and the usages of chivalry as the
trial by combat; and he only replied: "God knows, I have never granted
such license as you urge me with unless with the greatest repugnance;
and that I never saw men have strife together to the effusion of blood,
but I could have wished to appease it with the shedding of my own.""But, my gracious lord," said the prior, "it seems that, if we follow
not some such policy as this of my Lord of Albany, we must have recourse
to that of the Douglas; and, at the risk of the dubious event of battle,
and with the certainty of losing many excellent subjects, do, by means
of the Lowland swords, that which these wild mountaineers will otherwise
perform with their own hand.What says my Lord of Douglas to the policy
of his Grace of Albany?""Douglas," said the haughty lord, "never counselled that to be done by
policy which might be attained by open force.He remains by his opinion,
and is willing to march at the head of his own followers, with those
of the barons of Perth shire and the Carse, and either bring these
Highlanders to reason or subjection, or leave the body of a Douglas
among their savage wildernesses.""It is nobly spoken, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany; "and well might
the King rely upon thy undaunted heart and the courage of thy resolute
followers.But see you not how soon you may be called elsewhere, where
your presence and services are altogether indispensable to Scotland and
her monarch?Marked you not the gloomy tone in which the fiery March
limited his allegiance and faith to our sovereign here present to that
space for which he was to remain King Robert's vassal?And did not you
yourself suspect that he was plotting a transference of his allegiance
to England?Other chiefs, of subordinate power and inferior fame, may do
battle with the Highlanders; but if Dunbar admit the Percies and their
Englishmen into our frontiers, who will drive them back if the Douglas
be elsewhere?""My sword," answered Douglas, "is equally at the service of his Majesty
on the frontier or in the deepest recesses of the Highlands.I have seen
the backs of the proud Percy and George of Dunbar ere now, and I may
see them again.And, if it is the King's pleasure I should take measures
against this probable conjunction of stranger and traitor, I admit that,
rather than trust to an inferior or feebler hand the important task of
settling the Highlands, I would be disposed to give my opinion in favour
of the policy of my Lord of Albany, and suffer those savages to carve
each other's limbs, without giving barons and knights the trouble of
hunting them down.""My Lord of Douglas," said the Prince, who seemed determined to omit no
opportunity to gall his haughty father in law, "does not choose to leave
to us Lowlanders even the poor crumbs of honour which might be gathered
at the expense of the Highland kerne, while he, with his Border
chivalry, reaps the full harvest of victory over the English.But Percy
hath seen men's backs as well as Douglas; and I have known as great
wonders as that he who goes forth to seek such wool should come back
shorn.""A phrase," said Douglas, "well becoming a prince who speaks of honour
with a wandering harlot's scrip in his bonnet, by way of favor.""Excuse it, my lord," said Rothsay: "men who have matched unfittingly
become careless in the choice of those whom they love par amours.The
chained dog must snatch at the nearest bone."exclaimed the King, "art thou mad?or
wouldst thou draw down on thee the full storm of a king and father's
displeasure?""I am dumb," returned the Prince, "at your Grace's command.""Well, then, my Lord of Albany," said the King, "since such is your
advice, and since Scottish blood must flow, how, I pray you, are we to
prevail on these fierce men to refer their quarrel to such a combat as
you propose?""That, my liege," said Albany, "must be the result of more mature
deliberation.Gold will be needful
to bribe some of the bards and principal counsellors and spokesmen.The
chiefs, moreover, of both these leagues must be made to understand that,
unless they agree to this amicable settlement--"

"Amicable, brother!""Ay, amicable, my liege," replied his brother, "since it is better the
country were placed in peace, at the expense of losing a score or two of
Highland kernes, than remain at war till as many thousands are destroyed
by sword, fire, famine, and all the extremities of mountain battle.To return to the purpose: I think that the first party to whom the
accommodation is proposed will snatch at it eagerly; that the other will
be ashamed to reject an offer to rest the cause on the swords of their
bravest men; that the national vanity, and factious hate to each other,
will prevent them from seeing our purpose in adopting such a rule of
decision; and that they will be more eager to cut each other to pieces
than we can be to halloo them on.And now, as our counsels are finished,
so far as I can aid, I will withdraw.""Stay yet a moment," said the prior, "for I also have a grief to
disclose, of a nature so black and horrible, that your Grace's pious
heart will hardly credit its existence, and I state it mournfully,
because, as certain as that I am an unworthy servant of St.Dominic, it
is the cause of the displeasure of Heaven against this poor country, by
which our victories are turned into defeat, our gladness into mourning,
our councils distracted with disunion, and our country devoured by civil
war.""Speak, reverend prior," said the King; "assuredly, if the cause of
such evils be in me or in my house, I will take instant care to their
removal."He uttered these words with a faltering voice, and eagerly waited for
the prior's reply, in the dread, no doubt, that it might implicate
Rothsay in some new charge of folly or vice.His apprehensions perhaps
deceived him, when he thought he saw the churchman's eye rest for a
moment on the Prince, before he said, in a solemn tone, "Heresy, my
noble and gracious liege--heresy is among us.She snatches soul after
soul from the congregation, as wolves steal lambs from the sheep fold.""There are enough of shepherds to watch the fold," answered the Duke of
Rothsay."Here are four convents of regular monks alone around this poor
hamlet of Perth, and all the secular clergy besides.Methinks a town so
well garrisoned should be fit to keep out an enemy.""One traitor in a garrison, my lord," answered the prior, "can do much
to destroy the security of a city which is guarded by legions; and if
that one traitor is, either from levity, or love of novelty, or whatever
other motive, protected and fostered by those who should be most eager
to expel him from the fortress, his opportunities of working mischief
will be incalculably increased.""Your words seem to aim at some one in this presence, father prior,"
said the Douglas; "if at me, they do me foul wrong.I am well aware that
the abbot of Aberbrothock hath made some ill advised complaints, that
I suffered not his beeves to become too many for his pastures, or his
stock of grain to burst the girnels of the monastery, while my followers
lacked beef and their horses corn.But bethink you, the pastures and
cornfields which produced that plenty were bestowed by my ancestors
on the house of Aberbrothock, surely not with the purpose that their
descendant should starve in the midst of it; and neither will he, by St.But for heresy and false doctrine," he added, striking his large
hand heavily on the council table, "who is it that dare tax the Douglas?I would not have poor men burned for silly thoughts; but my hand and
sword are ever ready to maintain the Christian faith.""My lord, I doubt it not," said the prior; "so hath it ever been with
your most noble house.For the abbot's complaints, they may pass to a
second day.But what we now desire is a commission to some noble lord of
state, joined to others of Holy Church, to support by strength of hand,
if necessary, the inquiries which the reverend official of the bounds,
and other grave prelates, my unworthy self being one, are about to make
into the cause of the new doctrines, which are now deluding the simple,
and depraving the pure and precious faith, approved by the Holy Father
and his reverend predecessors.""Let the Earl of Douglas have a royal commission to this effect," said
Albany; "and let there be no exception whatever from his jurisdiction,
saving the royal person.For my own part, although conscious that I have
neither in act nor thought received or encouraged a doctrine which Holy
Church hath not sanctioned, yet I should blush to claim an immunity
under the blood royal of Scotland, lest I should seem to be seeking
refuge against a crime so horrible.""I will have nought to do with it," said Douglas: "to march against
the English, and the Southron traitor March, is task enough for me.Moreover, I am a true Scotsman, and will not give way to aught that may
put the Church of Scotland's head farther into the Roman yoke, or make
the baron's coronet stoop to the mitre and cowl.Do you, therefore, most
noble Duke of Albany, place your own name in the commission; and I pray
your Grace so to mitigate the zeal of the men of Holy Church who may
be associated with you, that there be no over zealous dealings; for the
smell of a fagot on the Tay would bring back the Douglas from the walls
of York."The Duke hastened to give the Earl assurance that the commission should
be exercised with lenity and moderation."Without a question," said King Robert, "the commission must be ample;
and did it consist with the dignity of our crown, we would not ourselves
decline its jurisdiction.But we trust that, while the thunders of
the church are directed against the vile authors of these detestable
heresies, there shall be measures of mildness and compassion taken with
the unfortunate victims of their delusions.""Such is ever the course of Holy Church, my lord," said the prior of St."Why, then, let the commission be expedited with due care, in name of
our brother Albany, and such others as shall be deemed convenient," said
the King."And now once again let us break up our council; and, Rothsay,
come thou with me, and lend me thine arm; I have matter for thy private
ear."here exclaimed the Prince, in the tone in which he would have
addressed a managed horse.said the King; "wilt thou never learn
reason and courtesy?""Let me not be thought to offend, my liege," said the Prince; "but we
are parting without learning what is to be done in the passing strange
adventure of the dead hand, which the Douglas hath so gallantly taken
up.We shall sit but uncomfortably here at Perth, if we are at variance
with the citizens.""With some little grant of lands and
money, and plenty of fair words, the burghers may be satisfied for this
time; but it were well that the barons and their followers, who are in
attendance on the court, were warned to respect the peace within burgh.""Surely, we would have it so," said the King; "let strict orders be
given accordingly.""It is doing the churls but too much grace," said the Douglas; "but be
it at your Highness's pleasure."Not before you taste a flagon of Gascon wine, my lord?""Pardon," replied the Earl, "I am not athirst, and I drink not for
fashion, but either for need or for friendship."The King, as if relieved by his absence, turned to Albany, and said:
"And now, my lord, we should chide this truant Rothsay of ours; yet he
hath served us so well at council, that we must receive his merits as
some atonement for his follies.""I am happy to hear it," answered Albany, with a countenance of pity and
incredulity, as if he knew nothing of the supposed services."Nay, brother, you are dull," said the King, "for I will not think you
envious.Did you not note that Rothsay was the first to suggest the mode
of settling the Highlands, which your experience brought indeed into
better shape, and which was generally approved of; and even now we had
broken up, leaving a main matter unconsidered, but that he put us in
mind of the affray with the citizens?""I nothing doubt, my liege," said the Duke of Albany, with the
acquiescence which he saw was expected, "that my royal nephew will soon
emulate his father's wisdom.""Or," said the Duke of Rothsay, "I may find it easier to borrow
from another member of my family that happy and comfortable cloak of
hypocrisy which covers all vices, and then it signifies little whether
they exist or not.""My lord prior," said the Duke, addressing the Dominican, "we will for a
moment pray your reverence's absence.The King and I have that to say to
the Prince which must have no further audience, not even yours."When the two royal brothers and the Prince were left together, the King
seemed in the highest degree embarrassed and distressed, Albany sullen
and thoughtful, while Rothsay himself endeavoured to cover some anxiety
under his usual appearance of levity."Royal brother," he said, "my princely nephew entertains with so much
suspicion any admonition coming from my mouth, that I must pray your
Grace yourself to take the trouble of telling him what it is most
fitting he should know.""It must be some unpleasing communication indeed, which my Lord of
Albany cannot wrap up in honied words," said the Prince."Peace with thine effrontery, boy," answered the King, passionately."You asked but now of the quarrel with the citizens.Who caused that
quarrel, David?What men were those who scaled the window of a peaceful
citizen and liege man, alarmed the night with torch and outcry, and
subjected our subjects to danger and affright?""More fear than danger, I fancy," answered the Prince; "but how can I of
all men tell who made this nocturnal disturbance?""There was a follower of thine own there," continued the King--"a man of
Belial, whom I will have brought to condign punishment.""I have no follower, to my knowledge, capable of deserving your
Highness's displeasure," answered the Prince."I will have no evasions, boy."It is to be hoped that I was serving the good saint, as a man of mould
might," answered the young man, carelessly."Will my royal nephew tell us how his master of the horse was employed
upon that holy eve?""Speak, David; I command thee to speak," said the King."Ramorny was employed in my service, I think that answer may satisfy my
uncle.""But it will not satisfy me," said the angry father."God knows, I never
coveted man's blood, but that Ramorny's head I will have, if law can
give it.He has been the encourager and partaker of all thy numerous
vices and follies.I will take care he shall be so no more."Do not injure an innocent man," interposed the Prince, desirous at
every sacrifice to preserve his favourite from the menaced danger: "I
pledge my word that Ramorny was employed in business of mine, therefore
could not be engaged in this brawl.""False equivocator that thou art!"said the King, presenting to the
Prince a ring, "behold the signet of Ramorny, lost in the infamous
affray!It fell into the hands of a follower of the Douglas, and was
given by the Earl to my brother.Speak not for Ramorny, for he dies; and
go thou from my presence, and repent the flagitious counsels which could
make thee stand before me with a falsehood in thy mouth.Oh, shame,
David--shame!as a son thou hast lied to thy father, as a knight to the
head of thy order."The Prince stood mute, conscience struck, and self convicted.He then
gave way to the honourable feelings which at bottom he really possessed,
and threw himself at his father's feet."The false knight," he said, "deserves degradation, the disloyal subject
death; but, oh!let the son crave from the father pardon for the servant
who did not lead him into guilt, but who reluctantly plunged himself
into it at his command.Let me bear the weight of my own folly, but
spare those who have been my tools rather than my accomplices.Remember,
Ramorny was preferred to my service by my sainted mother.""Name her not, David, I charge thee," said the King; "she is happy that
she never saw the child of her love stand before her doubly dishonoured
by guilt and by falsehood.""I am indeed unworthy to name her," said the Prince; "and yet, my dear
father, in her name I must petition for Ramorny's life.""If I might offer my counsel," said the Duke of Albany, who saw that
a reconciliation would soon take place betwixt the father and son, "I
would advise that Ramorny be dismissed from the Prince's household and
society, with such further penalty as his imprudence may seem to merit.The public will be contented with his disgrace, and the matter will be
easily accommodated or stifled, so that his Highness do not attempt to
screen his servant.""Wilt thou, for my sake, David," said the King, with a faltering voice
and the tear in his eye, "dismiss this dangerous man?--for my sake, who
could not refuse thee the heart out of my bosom?""It shall be done, my father--done instantly," the Prince replied; and
seizing the pen, he wrote a hasty dismissal of Ramorny from his service,
and put it into Albany's hands."I would I could fulfil all your wishes
as easily, my royal father," he added, again throwing himself at the
King's feet, who raised him up and fondly folded him in his arms.Albany scowled, but was silent; and it was not till after the space of a
minute or two that he said: "This matter being so happily accommodated,
let me ask if your Majesty is pleased to attend the evensong service in
the chapel?""Have I not thanks to pay to God, who has
restored union to my family?"So please your Grace to give me leave of absence--no," said the Duke."I must concert with the Douglas and others the manner in which we may
bring these Highland vultures to our lure."Albany retired to think over his ambitious projects, while the
father and son attended divine service, to thank God for their happy
reconciliation.Will you go to the Hielands, Lizzy Lyndesay,
     Will you go the Hielands wi' me?Will you go to the Hielands, Lizzy Lyndesay,
     My bride and my darling to be?A former chapter opened in the royal confessional; we are now to
introduce our readers to a situation somewhat similar, though the
scene and persons were very different.Instead of a Gothic and darkened
apartment in a monastery, one of the most beautiful prospects in
Scotland lay extended beneath the hill of Kinnoul, and at the foot of
a rock which commanded the view in every direction sat the Fair Maid of
Perth, listening in an attitude of devout attention to the instructions
of a Carthusian monk, in his white gown and scapular, who concluded his
discourse with prayer, in which his proselyte devoutly joined.When they had finished their devotions, the priest sat for some time
with his eyes fixed on the glorious prospect, of which even the early
and chilly season could not conceal the beauties, and it was some time
ere he addressed his attentive companion."When I behold," he said at length, "this rich and varied land, with its
castles, churches, convents, stately palaces, and fertile fields, these
extensive woods, and that noble river, I know not, my daughter, whether
most to admire the bounty of God or the ingratitude of man.He hath
given us the beauty and fertility of the earth, and we have made the
scene of his bounty a charnel house and a battlefield.He hath given
us power over the elements, and skill to erect houses for comfort and
defence, and we have converted them into dens for robbers and ruffians.""Yet, surely, my father, there is room for comfort," replied Catharine,
"even in the very prospect we look upon.Yonder four goodly convents,
with their churches, and their towers, which tell the citizens with
brazen voice that they should think on their religious duties; their
inhabitants, who have separated themselves from the world, its pursuits
and its pleasures, to dedicate themselves to the service of Heaven--all
bear witness that, if Scotland be a bloody and a sinful land, she is
yet alive and sensible to the claims which religion demands of the human
race.""Verily, daughter," answered the priest, "what you say seems truth; and
yet, nearly viewed, too much of the comfort you describe will be found
delusive.It is true, there was a period in the Christian world when
good men, maintaining themselves by the work of their hands, assembled
together, not that they might live easily or sleep softly, but that
they might strengthen each other in the Christian faith, and qualify
themselves to be teachers of the Word to the people.Doubtless there are
still such to be found in the holy edifices on which we now look.But it
is to be feared that the love of many has waxed cold.Our churchmen have
become wealthy, as well by the gifts of pious persons as by the bribes
which wicked men have given in their ignorance, imagining that they can
purchase that pardon by endowments to the church which Heaven has only
offered to sincere penitents.And thus, as the church waxeth rich, her
doctrines have unhappily become dim and obscure, as a light is less
seen if placed in a lamp of chased gold than beheld through a screen
of glass.God knows, if I see these things and mark them, it is from no
wish of singularity or desire to make myself a teacher in Israel; but
because the fire burns in my bosom, and will not permit me to be
silent.I obey the rules of my order, and withdraw not myself from
its austerities.Be they essential to our salvation, or be they mere
formalities, adopted to supply the want of real penitence and sincere
devotion, I have promised, nay, vowed, to observe them; and they shall
be respected by me the more, that otherwise I might be charged with
regarding my bodily ease, when Heaven is my witness how lightly I value
what I may be called on to act or suffer, if the purity of the church
could be restored, or the discipline of the priesthood replaced in its
primitive simplicity.""But, my father," said Catharine, "even for these opinions men term
you a Lollard and a Wickliffite, and say it is your desire to destroy
churches and cloisters, and restore the religion of heathenesse.""Even so, my daughter, am I driven to seek refuge in hills and rocks,
and must be presently contented to take my flight amongst the rude
Highlanders, who are thus far in a more gracious state than those
I leave behind me, that theirs are crimes of ignorance, not of
presumption.I will not omit to take such means of safety and escape
from their cruelty as Heaven may open to me; for, while such appear, I
shall account it a sign that I have still a service to accomplish.But
when it is my Master's pleasure, He knows how willingly Clement Blair
will lay down a vilified life upon earth, in humble hope of a blessed
exchange hereafter.But wherefore dost thou look northward so anxiously,
my child?Thy young eyes are quicker than mine--dost thou see any one
coming?""I look, father, for the Highland youth, Conachar, who will be thy
guide to the hills, where his father can afford thee a safe, if a rude,
retreat.This he has often promised, when we spoke of you and of your
lessons.I fear he is now in company where he will soon forget them.""The youth hath sparkles of grace in him," said Father Clement;
"although those of his race are usually too much devoted to their own
fierce and savage customs to endure with patience either the restraints
of religion or those of the social law.Thou hast never told me,
daughter, how, contrary to all the usages either of the burgh or of the
mountains, this youth came to reside in thy father's house?""All I know touching that matter," said Catharine, "is, that his father
is a man of consequence among those hill men, and that he desired as a
favour of my father, who hath had dealings with them in the way of his
merchandise, to keep this youth for a certain time, and that it is only
two days since they parted, as Conachar was to return home to his own
mountains.""And why has my daughter," demanded the priest, "maintained such a
correspondence with this Highland youth, that she should know how to
send for him when she desired to use his services in my behalf?Surely,
this is much influence for a maiden to possess over such a wild colt as
this youthful mountaineer."Catharine blushed, and answered with hesitation: "If I have had any
influence with Conachar, Heaven be my witness, I have only exerted it to
enforce upon his fiery temper compliance with the rules of civil life.It is true, I have long expected that you, my father, would be obliged
to take to flight, and I therefore had agreed with him that he should
meet me at this place as soon as he should receive a message from
me with a token, which I yesterday despatched.The messenger was a
lightfooted boy of his own clan, whom he used sometimes to send on
errands into the Highlands.""And am I then to understand, daughter, that this youth, so fair to the
eye, was nothing more dear to you than as you desired to enlighten his
mind and reform his manners?""It is so, my father, and no otherwise," answered Catharine; "and
perhaps I did not do well to hold intimacy with him, even for his
instruction and improvement."Then have I been mistaken, my daughter; for I thought I had seen in
thee of late some change of purpose, and some wishful regards looking
back to this world, of which you were at one time resolved to take
leave."Catharine hung down her head and blushed more deeply than ever as she
said: "Yourself, father, were used to remonstrate against my taking the
veil.""Nor do I now approve of it, my child," said the priest."Marriage is an
honourable state, appointed by Heaven as the regular means of continuing
the race of man; and I read not in the Scriptures what human inventions
have since affirmed concerning the superior excellence of a state of
celibacy.But I am jealous of thee, my child, as a father is of his only
daughter, lest thou shouldst throw thyself away upon some one unworthy
of thee.Thy parent, I know, less nice in thy behalf than I am,
countenances the addresses of that fierce and riotous reveller whom they
call Henry of the Wynd.He is rich it may be; but a haunter of idle and
debauched company--a common prizefighter, who has shed human blood like
water.Can such a one be a fit mate for Catharine Glover?And yet report
says they are soon to be united."The Fair Maid of Perth's complexion changed from red to pale, and from
pale to red, as she hastily replied: "I think not of him; though it is
true some courtesies have passed betwixt us of late, both as he is my
father's friend and as being according to the custom of the time, my
Valentine.""And can your modesty
and prudence have trifled so much with the delicacy of your sex as to
place yourself in such a relation to such a man as this artificer?Think
you that this Valentine, a godly saint and Christian bishop, as he is
said to have been, ever countenanced a silly and unseemly custom, more
likely to have originated in the heathen worship of Flora or Venus,
when mortals gave the names of deities to their passions; and studied to
excite instead of restraining them?""Father," said Catharine, in a tone of more displeasure than she had
ever before assumed to the Carthusian, "I know not upon what ground you
tax me thus severely for complying with a general practice, authorised
by universal custom and sanctioned by my father's authority.I cannot
feel it kind that you put such misconstruction upon me.""Forgive me, daughter," answered the priest, mildly, "if I have given
you offence.But this Henry Gow, or Smith, is a forward, licentious
man, to whom you cannot allow any uncommon degree of intimacy
and encouragement, without exposing yourself to worse
misconstruction--unless, indeed, it be your purpose to wed him, and that
very shortly.""Say no more of it, my father," said Catharine."You give me more pain
than you would desire to do; and I may be provoked to answer otherwise
than as becomes me.Perhaps I have already had cause enough to make
me repent my compliance with an idle custom.At any rate, believe that
Henry Smith is nothing to me, and that even the idle intercourse arising
from St.Valentine's Day is utterly broken off.""I am rejoiced to hear it, my daughter," replied the Carthusian, "and
must now prove you on another subject, which renders me most anxious on
your behalf.You cannot your self be ignorant of it, although I could
wish it were not necessary to speak of a thing so dangerous, even,
before these surrounding rocks, cliffs, and stones.Catharine, you have a lover in the highest rank of Scotland's sons of
honour?""I know it, father," answered Catharine, composedly."So would I also," said the priest, "did I see in my daughter only the
child of folly, which most young women are at her age, especially if
possessed of the fatal gift of beauty.But as thy charms, to speak the
language of an idle world, have attached to thee a lover of such high
rank, so I know that thy virtue and wisdom will maintain the influence
over the Prince's mind which thy beauty hath acquired.""Father," replied Catharine, "the Prince is a licentious gallant, whose
notice of me tends only to my disgrace and ruin.Can you, who seemed
but now afraid that I acted imprudently in entering into an ordinary
exchange of courtesies with one of my own rank, speak with patience of
the sort of correspondence which the heir of Scotland dares to fix
upon me?Know that it is but two nights since he, with a party of his
debauched followers, would have carried me by force from my father's
house, had I not been rescued by that same rash spirited Henry Smith,
who, if he be too hasty in venturing on danger on slight occasion, is
always ready to venture his life in behalf of innocence or in resistance
of oppression.It is well my part to do him that justice.""I should know something of that matter," said the monk, "since it was
my voice that sent him to your assistance.I had seen the party as I
passed your door, and was hastening to the civil power in order to raise
assistance, when I perceived a man's figure coming slowly towards me.Apprehensive it might be one of the ambuscade, I stepped behind the
buttresses of the chapel of St.John, and seeing from a nearer view
that it was Henry Smith, I guessed which way he was bound, and raised my
voice, in an exhortation which made him double his speed.""I am beholden to you, father," said Catharine; "but all this, and the
Duke of Rothsay's own language to me, only show that the Prince is a
profligate young man, who will scruple no extremities which may promise
to gratify an idle passion, at whatever expense to its object.His
emissary, Ramorny, has even had the insolence to tell me that my father
shall suffer for it if I dare to prefer being the wife of an honest man
to becoming the loose paramour of a married prince.So I see no other
remedy than to take the veil, or run the risk of my own ruin and my poor
father's.Were there no other reason, the terror of these threats,
from a man so notoriously capable of keeping his word, ought as much to
prevent my becoming the bride of any worthy man as it should prohibit me
from unlatching his door to admit murderers.Oh, good father, what a lot
is mine!and how fatal am I likely to prove to my affectionate parent,
and to any one with whom I might ally my unhappy fortunes!""Be yet of good cheer, my daughter," said the monk; "there is comfort
for thee even in this extremity of apparent distress.Ramorny is a
villain, and abuses the ear of his patron.The Prince is unhappily a
dissipated and idle youth; but, unless my grey hairs have been strangely
imposed on, his character is beginning to alter.He hath been awakened
to Ramorny's baseness, and deeply regrets having followed his evil
advice.I believe, nay, I am well convinced, that his passion for you
has assumed a nobler and purer character, and that the lessons he has
heard from me on the corruptions of the church and of the times will, if
enforced from your lips, sink deeply into his heart, and perhaps produce
fruits for the world to wonder as well as rejoice at.Old prophecies
have said that Rome shall fall by the speech of a woman.""These are dreams, father," said Catharine--"the visions of one whose
thoughts are too much on better things to admit his thinking justly
upon the ordinary affairs of Perth.When we have looked long at the sun,
everything else can only be seen indistinctly.""Thou art over hasty, my daughter," said Clement, "and thou shalt be
convinced of it.The prospects which I am to open to thee were unfit to
be exposed to one of a less firm sense of virtue, or a more ambitious
temper.Perhaps it is not fit that, even to you, I should display them;
but my confidence is strong in thy wisdom and thy principles.Know,
then, that there is much chance that the Church of Rome will dissolve
the union which she has herself formed, and release the Duke of Rothsay
from his marriage with Marjory Douglas.""And if the church hath power and will to do this," replied the maiden,
"what influence can the divorce of the Duke from his wife produce on the
fortunes of Catharine Glover?"She looked at the priest anxiously as she spoke, and he had some
apparent difficulty in framing his reply, for he looked on the ground
while he answered her."What did beauty do for Catharine Logie?Unless our fathers have told us
falsely, it raised her to share the throne of David Bruce.""Did she live happy or die regretted, good father?"asked Catharine, in
the same calm and steady tone."She formed her alliance from temporal, and perhaps criminal, ambition,"
replied Father Clement; "and she found her reward in vanity and vexation
of spirit.But had she wedded with the purpose that the believing wife
should convert the unbelieving, or confirm the doubting, husband, what
then had been her reward?Love and honour upon earth, and an inheritance
in Heaven with Queen Margaret and those heroines who have been the
nursing mothers of the church."Hitherto Catharine had sat upon a stone beside the priest's feet, and
looked up to him as she spoke or listened; but now, as if animated
by calm, yet settled, feelings of disapprobation, she rose up, and,
extending her hand towards the monk as she spoke, addressed him with
a countenance and voice which might have become a cherub, pitying,
and even as much as possible sparing, the feelings of the mortal whose
errors he is commissioned to rebuke.she said, "and can so much of the wishes, hopes,
and prejudices of this vile world affect him who may be called tomorrow
to lay down his life for opposing the corruptions of a wicked age and
backsliding priesthood?Can it be the severely virtuous Father Clement
who advises his child to aim at, or even to think of, the possession of
a throne and a bed which cannot become vacant but by an act of crying
injustice to the present possessor?Can it be the wise reformer of
the church who wishes to rest a scheme, in itself so unjust, upon
a foundation so precarious?Since when is it, good father, that the
principal libertine has altered his morals so much, to be likely to
court in honourable fashion the daughter of a Perth artisan?Two days
must have wrought this change; for only that space has passed since he
was breaking into my father's house at midnight, with worse mischief in
his mind than that of a common robber.And think you that, if Rothsay's
heart could dictate so mean a match, he could achieve such a purpose
without endangering both his succession and his life, assailed by the
Douglas and March at the same time, for what they must receive as an act
of injury and insult to both their houses?Father Clement, where
was your principle, where your prudence, when they suffered you to
be bewildered by so strange a dream, and placed the meanest of your
disciples in the right thus to reproach you?"The old man's eyes filled with tears, as Catharine, visibly and
painfully affected by what she had said, became at length silent."By the mouths of babes and sucklings," he said, "hath He rebuked those
who would seem wise in their generation.I thank Heaven, that hath
taught me better thoughts than my own vanity suggested, through the
medium of so kind a monitress.Yes, Catharine, I must not hereafter
wonder or exclaim when I see those whom I have hitherto judged too
harshly struggling for temporal power, and holding all the while the
language of religious zeal.I thank thee, daughter, for thy salutary
admonition, and I thank Heaven that sent it by thy lips, rather than
those of a stern reprover."Catharine had raised her head to reply, and bid the old man, whose
humiliation gave her pain, be comforted, when her eyes were arrested
by an object close at hand.Among the crags and cliffs which surrounded
this place of seclusion, there were two which stood in such close
contiguity, that they seemed to have been portions of the same rock,
which, rendered by lightning or by an earthquake, now exhibited a chasm
of about four feet in breadth, betwixt the masses of stone.Into this
chasm an oak tree had thrust itself, in one of the fantastic frolics
which vegetation often exhibits in such situations.The tree, stunted
and ill fed, had sent its roots along the face of the rock in all
directions to seek for supplies, and they lay like military lines of
communication, contorted, twisted, and knotted like the immense snakes
of the Indian archipelago.As Catharine's look fell upon the curious
complication of knotty branches and twisted roots, she was suddenly
sensible that two large eyes were visible among them, fixed and glaring
at her, like those of a wild animal in ambush.She started, and, without
speaking, pointed out the object to her companion, and looking herself
with more strict attention, could at length trace out the bushy red
hair and shaggy beard, which had hitherto been concealed by the drooping
branches and twisted roots of the tree.When he saw himself discovered, the Highlander, for such he proved,
stepped forth from his lurking place, and, stalking forward, displayed
a colossal person, clothed in a purple, red, and green checked plaid,
under which he wore a jacket of bull's hide.His bow and arrows were at
his back, his head was bare, and a large quantity of tangled locks, like
the glibbs of the Irish, served to cover the head, and supplied all the
purposes of a bonnet.His belt bore a sword and dagger, and he had in
his hand a Danish pole axe, more recently called a Lochaber axe.Through
the same rude portal advanced, one by one, four men more, of similar
size, and dressed and armed in the same manner.Catharine was too much accustomed to the appearance of the inhabitants
of the mountains so near to Perth to permit herself to be alarmed, as
another Lowland maiden might have been on the same occasion.She saw
with tolerable composure these gigantic forms arrange themselves in a
semicircle around and in front of the monk and herself, all bending upon
them in silence their large fixed eyes, expressing, as far as she could
judge, a wild admiration of her beauty.She inclined her head to them,
and uttered imperfectly the usual words of a Highland salutation.The
elder and leader of the party returned the greeting, and then again
remained silent and motionless.The monk told his beads; and even
Catharine began to have strange fears for her personal safety, and
anxiety to know whether they were to consider themselves at personal
freedom.She resolved to make the experiment, and moved forward as if
to descend the hill; but when she attempted to pass the line of
Highlanders, they extended their poleaxes betwixt each other, so as
effectually to occupy each opening through which she could have passed.Somewhat disconcerted, yet not dismayed, for she could not conceive that
any evil was intended, she sat down upon one of the scattered fragments
of rock, and bade the monk, standing by her side, be of good courage."If I fear," said Father Clement, "it is not for myself; for whether I
be brained with the axes of these wild men, like an ox when, worn out
by labour, he is condemned to the slaughter, or whether I am bound with
their bowstrings, and delivered over to those who will take my life with
more cruel ceremony, it can but little concern me, if they suffer thee,
dearest daughter, to escape uninjured.""We have neither of us," replied the Maiden of Perth, "any cause for
apprehending evil; and here comes Conachar to assure us of it."Yet, as she spoke, she almost doubted her own eyes; so altered were
the manner and attire of the handsome, stately, and almost splendidly
dressed youth who, springing like a roebuck from a cliff of considerable
height, lighted just in front of her.His dress was of the same tartan
worn by those who had first made their appearance, but closed at the
throat and elbows with a necklace and armlets of gold.The hauberk which
he wore over his person was of steel, but so clearly burnished that it
shone like silver.His arms were profusely ornamented, and his bonnet,
besides the eagle's feather marking the quality of chief, was adorned
with a chain of gold, wrapt several times around it, and secured by a
large clasp, glistening with pearls.His brooch, by which the tartan
mantle, or plaid, as it is now called, was secured on the shoulder, was
also of gold, large and curiously carved.He bore no weapon in his hand,
excepting a small sapling stick with a hooked head.His whole appearance
and gait, which used formerly to denote a sullen feeling of conscious
degradation, was now bold, forward, and haughty; and he stood before
Catharine with smiling confidence, as if fully conscious of his improved
appearance, and waiting till she should recognise him."Conachar," said Catharine, desirous to break this state of suspense,
"are these your father's men?""No, fair Catharine," answered the young man."Conachar is no more,
unless in regard to the wrongs he has sustained, and the vengeance
which they demand.I am Ian Eachin MacIan, son to the chief of the Clan
Quhele.I have moulted my feathers, as you see, when I changed my name.And for these men, they are not my father's followers, but mine.You
see only one half of them collected: they form a band consisting of my
foster father and eight sons, who are my bodyguard, and the children of
my belt, who breathe but to do my will.But Conachar," he added, in a
softer tone of voice, "lives again so soon as Catharine desires to see
him; and while he is the young chief of the Clan Quhele to all others,
he is to her as humble and obedient as when he was Simon Glover's
apprentice.See, here is the stick I had from you when we nutted
together in the sunny braes of Lednoch, when autumn was young in the
year that is gone.I would not exchange it, Catharine, for the truncheon
of my tribe."While Eachin thus spoke, Catharine began to doubt in her own mind
whether she had acted prudently in requesting the assistance of a bold
young man, elated, doubtless, by his sudden elevation from a state of
servitude to one which she was aware gave him extensive authority over a
very lawless body of adherents."You do not fear me, fair Catharine?"said the young chief, taking her
hand."I suffered my people to appear before you for a few minutes,
that I might see how you could endure their presence; and methinks you
regarded them as if you were born to be a chieftain's wife.""I have no reason to fear wrong from Highlanders," said Catharine,
firmly; "especially as I thought Conachar was with them.Conachar has
drunk of our cup and eaten of our bread; and my father has often had
traffic with Highlanders, and never was there wrong or quarrel betwixt
him and them."replied Hector, for such is the Saxon equivalent for Eachin,
"what!never when he took the part of the Gow Chrom (the bandy legged
smith) against Eachin MacIan?Say nothing to excuse it, and believe it
will be your own fault if I ever again allude to it.But you had some
command to lay upon me; speak, and you shall be obeyed."Catharine hastened to reply; for there was something in the young
chief's manner and language which made her desire to shorten the
interview."Eachin," she said, "since Conachar is no longer your name, you ought
to be sensible that in claiming, as I honestly might, a service from my
equal, I little thought that I was addressing a person of such superior
power and consequence.You, as well as I, have been obliged to the
religious instruction of this good man.He is now in great danger:
wicked men have accused him with false charges, and he is desirous to
remain in safety and concealment till the storm shall pass away."Ay, the worthy clerk did much for me, and
more than my rugged temper was capable to profit by.I will be glad to
see any one in the town of Perth persecute one who hath taken hold of
MacIan's mantle!""It may not be safe to trust too much to that," said Catharine."I
nothing doubt the power of your tribe; but when the Black Douglas takes
up a feud, he is not to be scared by the shaking of a Highland plaid."The Highlander disguised his displeasure at this speech with a forced
laugh."The sparrow," he said, "that is next the eye seems larger than the
eagle that is perched on Bengoile.You fear the Douglasses most, because
they sit next to you.You will not believe how
wide our hills, and vales, and forests extend beyond the dusky barrier
of yonder mountains, and you think all the world lies on the banks of
the Tay.But this good clerk shall see hills that could hide him were
all the Douglasses on his quest--ay, and he shall see men enough also
to make them glad to get once more southward of the Grampians.And
wherefore should you not go with the good man?I will send a party to
bring him in safety from Perth, and we will set up the old trade beyond
Loch Tay--only no more cutting out of gloves for me.I will find your
father in hides, but I will not cut them, save when they are on the
creatures' backs.""My father will come one day and see your housekeeping, Conachar--I
mean, Hector.But times must be quieter, for there is feud between the
townspeople and the followers of the noblemen, and there is speech of
war about to break out in the Highlands.""Yes, by Our Lady, Catharine!and were it not for that same Highland
war, you should nor thus put off your Highland visit, my pretty
mistress.But the race of the hills are no longer to be divided into two
nations.They will fight like men for the supremacy, and he who gets it
will deal with the King of Scotland as an equal, not as a superior.Pray
that the victory may fall to MacIan, my pious St.Catharine, for thou
shalt pray for one who loves thee dearly.""I will pray for the right," said Catharine; "or rather, I will pray
that there be peace on all sides.Farewell, kind and excellent Father
Clement.Believe I shall never forget thy lessons; remember me in thy
prayers.But how wilt thou be able to sustain a journey so toilsome?""They shall carry him if need be," said Hector, "if we go far without
finding a horse for him.But you, Catharine--it is far from hence to
Perth.Let me attend you thither as I was wont.""If you were as you were wont, I would not refuse your escort.But gold
brooches and bracelets are perilous company, when the Liddesdale and
Annandale lancers are riding as throng upon the highway as the leaves
at Hallowmass; and there is no safe meeting betwixt Highland tartans and
steel jackets."She hazarded this remark, as she somewhat suspected that, in casting his
slough, young Eachin had not entirely surmounted the habits which he had
acquired in his humbler state, and that, though he might use bold words,
he would not be rash enough to brave the odds of numbers, to which a
descent into the vicinity of the city would be likely to expose him.It
appeared that she judged correctly; for, after a farewell, in which she
compounded for the immunity of her lips by permitting him to kiss her
hand, she returned towards Perth, and could obtain at times, when
she looked back, an occasional glance of the Highlanders, as, winding
through the most concealed and impracticable paths, they bent their way
towards the North.She felt in part relieved from her immediate anxiety, as the distance
increased betwixt her and these men, whose actions were only directed by
the will of their chief, and whose chief was a giddy and impetuous boy.She apprehended no insult on her return to Perth from the soldiery of
any party whom she might meet; for the rules of chivalry were in those
days a surer protection to a maiden of decent appearance than an escort
of armed men, whose cognizance might not be acknowledged as friendly
by any other party whom they might chance to encounter.But more remote
dangers pressed on her apprehension.The pursuit of the licentious
Prince was rendered formidable by threats which his unprincipled
counsellor, Ramorny, had not shunned to utter against her father, if she
persevered in her coyness.These menaces, in such an age, and from such
a character, were deep grounds for alarm; nor could she consider the
pretensions to her favour which Conachar had scarce repressed during his
state of servitude, and seemed now to avow boldly, as less fraught with
evil, since there had been repeated incursions of the Highlanders into
the very town of Perth, and citizens had, on more occasions than one,
been made prisoners and carried off from their own houses, or had fallen
by the claymore in the very streets of their city.She feared, too, her
father's importunity on behalf of the smith, of whose conduct on St.Valentine's Day unworthy reports had reached her; and whose suit, had
he stood clear in her good opinion, she dared not listen to, while
Ramorny's threats of revenge upon her father rung on her ear.She
thought on these various dangers with the deepest apprehension, and an
earnest desire to escape from them and herself, by taking refuge in the
cloister; but saw no possibility of obtaining her father's consent to
the only course from which she expected peace and protection.In the course of these reflections, we cannot discover that she very
distinctly regretted that her perils attended her because she was the
Fair Maid of Perth.This was one point which marked that she was not
yet altogether an angel; and perhaps it was another that, in despite of
Henry Smith's real or supposed delinquencies, a sigh escaped from her
bosom when she thought upon St.Oh, for a draught of power to steep
     The soul of agony in sleep!We have shown the secrets of the confessional; those of the sick
chamber are not hidden from us.The darkened apartment, where salves and
medicines showed that the leech had been busy in his craft, a tall thin
form lay on a bed, arrayed in a nightgown belted around him, with
pain on his brow, and a thousand stormy passions agitating his bosom.Everything in the apartment indicated a man of opulence and of expense.Henbane Dwining, the apothecary, who seemed to have the care of the
patient, stole with a crafty and catlike step from one corner of the
room to another, busying himself with mixing medicines and preparing
dressings.The sick man groaned once or twice, on which the leech,
advancing to his bedside, asked whether these sounds were a token of the
pain of his body or of the distress of his mind."Of both, thou poisoning varlet," said Sir John Ramorny, "and of being
encumbered with thy accursed company.""If that is all, I can relieve your knighthood of one of these ills
by presently removing myself elsewhere.Thanks to the feuds of this
boisterous time, had I twenty hands, instead of these two poor servants
of my art (displaying his skinny palms), there is enough of employment
for them--well requited employment, too, where thanks and crowns contend
which shall best pay my services; while you, Sir John, wreak upon your
chirurgeon the anger you ought only to bear against the author of your
wound.""Villain, it is beneath me to reply to thee," said the patient; "but
every word of thy malignant tongue is a dirk, inflicting wounds which
set all the medicines of Arabia at defiance.""Sir John, I understand you not; but if you give way to these
tempestuous fits of rage, it is impossible but fever and inflammation
must be the result.""Why then dost thou speak in a sense to chafe my blood?Why dost thou
name the supposition of thy worthless self having more hands than
nature gave thee, while I, a knight and gentleman, am mutilated like a
<DW36>?""Sir John," replied the chirurgeon, "I am no divine, nor a mainly
obstinate believer in some things which divines tell us.Yet I may
remind you that you have been kindly dealt with; for if the blow which
has done you this injury had lighted on your neck, as it was aimed, it
would have swept your head from your shoulders, instead of amputating a
less considerable member.""I wish it had, Dwining--I wish it had lighted as it was addressed.I
should not then have seen a policy which had spun a web so fine as mine
burst through by the brute force of a drunken churl.I should not have
been reserved to see horses which I must not mount, lists which I must
no longer enter, splendours which I cannot hope to share, or battles
which I must not take part in.I should not, with a man's passions for
power and for strife, be set to keep place among the women, despised by
them, too, as a miserable, impotent <DW36>, unable to aim at obtaining
the favour of the sex.""Supposing all this to be so, I will yet pray of your knighthood to
remark," replied Dwining, still busying himself with arranging the
dressings of the wounds, "that your eyes, which you must have lost
with your head, may, being spared to you, present as rich a prospect of
pleasure as either ambition, or victory in the list or in the field, or
the love of woman itself, could have proposed to you.""My sense is too dull to catch thy meaning, leech," replied Ramorny."What is this precious spectacle reserved to me in such a shipwreck?""The dearest that mankind knows," replied Dwining; and then, in the
accent of a lover who utters the name of his beloved mistress, and
expresses his passion for her in the very tone of his voice, he added
the word "REVENGE!"The patient had raised himself on his couch to listen with some anxiety
for the solution of the physician's enigma.He laid himself down again
as he heard it explained, and after a short pause asked, "In what
Christian college learned you this morality, good Master Dwining?""In no Christian college," answered his physician; "for, though it is
privately received in most, it is openly and manfully adopted in none.But I have studied among the sages of Granada, where the fiery souled
Moor lifts high his deadly dagger as it drops with his enemy's blood,
and avows the doctrine which the pallid Christian practises, though
coward-like he dare not name it.""Thou art then a more high souled villain than I deemed thee," said
Ramorny."The waters that are the stillest are
also the deepest; and the foe is most to be dreaded who never threatens
till he strikes.You knights and men at arms go straight to your purpose
with sword in hand.We who are clerks win our access with a noiseless
step and an indirect approach, but attain our object not less surely.""And I," said the knight, "who have trod to my revenge with a mailed
foot, which made all echo around it, must now use such a slipper as
thine--ha?""He who lacks strength," said the wily mediciner, "must attain his
purpose by skill.""And tell me sincerely, mediciner, wherefore thou wouldst read me these
devil's lessons?Why wouldst thou thrust me faster or farther on to my
vengeance than I may seem to thee ready to go of my own accord?I am old
in the ways of the world, man; and I know that such as thou do not drop
words in vain, or thrust themselves upon the dangerous confidence of men
like me save with the prospect of advancing some purpose of their own.What interest hast thou in the road, whether peaceful or bloody, which I
may pursue on these occurrents?""In plain dealing, sir knight, though it is what I seldom use," answered
the leech, "my road to revenge is the same with yours."said Ramorny, with a tone of scornful surprise."I
thought it had been high beyond thy reach.Thou aim at the same revenge
with Ramorny?""Ay, truly," replied Dwining, "for the smithy churl under whose blow you
have suffered has often done me despite and injury.He has thwarted
me in counsel and despised me in action.His brutal and unhesitating
bluntness is a living reproach to the subtlety of my natural
disposition."And you hope to hind an active coadjutor in me?"said Ramorny, in the
same supercilious tone as before."But know, the artisan fellow is too
low in degree to be to me either the object of hatred or of fear.We hate not the reptile that has stung us, though we
might shake it off the wound, and tread upon it.I know the ruffian of
old as a stout man at arms, and a pretender, as I have heard, to the
favour of the scornful puppet whose beauties, forsooth, spurred us to
our wise and hopeful attempt.Fiends that direct this nether world,
by what malice have ye decided that the hand which has couched a lance
against the bosom of a prince should be struck off like a sapling by
the blow of a churl, and during the turmoil of a midnight riot?Well,
mediciner, thus far our courses hold together, and I bid thee well
believe that I will crush for thee this reptile mechanic.But do not
thou think to escape me when that part of my revenge is done which will
be most easily and speedily accomplished.""Not, it may be, altogether so easily accomplished," said the
apothecary; "for if your knighthood will credit me, there will be
found small ease or security in dealing with him.He is the strongest,
boldest, and most skilful swordsman in Perth and all the country around
it.""Fear nothing; he shall be met with had he the strength of Sampson.Hope not thou to escape my vengeance, unless thou become
my passive agent in the scene which is to follow.I have studied at no Moorish college, and lack some of
thy unbounded appetite for revenge, but yet I will have my share of
vengeance.Listen to me, mediciner, while I shall thus far unfold
myself; but beware of treachery, for, powerful as thy fiend is, thou
hast taken lessons from a meaner devil than mine.Hearken--the master
whom I have served through vice and virtue, with too much zeal for my
own character, perhaps, but with unshaken fidelity to him--the very man,
to soothe whose frantic folly I have incurred this irreparable loss, is,
at the prayer of his doating father, about to sacrifice me, by turning
me out of his favour, and leaving me at the mercy of the hypocritical
relative with whom he seeks a precarious reconciliation at my expense.If he perseveres in this most ungrateful purpose, thy fiercest Moors,
were their complexion swarthy as the smoke of hell, shall blush to see
their revenge outdone.But I will give him one more chance for honour
and safety before my wrath shall descend on him in unrelenting and
unmitigated fury.There, then, thus far thou hast my confidence.Where is the hand that
should be the pledge and representative of Ramorny's plighted word?Is it nailed on the public pillory, or flung as offal to the houseless
dogs, who are even now snarling over it?Lay thy finger on the mutilated
stump, then, and swear to be a faithful actor in my revenge, as I shall
be in yours.How now, sir leech look you pale--you, who say to death,
stand back or advance, can you tremble to think of him or to hear him
named?I have not mentioned your fee, for one who loves revenge for
itself requires no deeper bribe; yet, if broad lands and large sums of
gold can increase thy zeal in a brave cause, believe me, these shall not
be lacking.""They tell for something in my humble wishes," said Dwining: "the poor
man in this bustling world is thrust down like a dwarf in a crowd, and
so trodden under foot; the rich and powerful rise like giants above the
press, and are at ease, while all is turmoil around them.""Then shalt thou arise above the press, mediciner, as high as gold
can raise thee.This purse is weighty, yet it is but an earnest of thy
guerdon.""And this Smith, my noble benefactor," said the leech, as he pouched the
gratuity--"this Henry of the Wynd, or what ever is his name--would not
the news that he hath paid the penalty of his action assuage the pain of
thy knighthood's wound better than the balm of Mecca with which I have
salved it?""He is beneath the thoughts of Ramorny; and I have no more resentment
against him than I have ill will at the senseless weapon which he
swayed.But it is just thy hate should be vented upon him.Where is he
chiefly to be met with?""That also I have considered," said Dwining."To make the attempt by day
in his own house were too open and dangerous, for he hath five servants
who work with him at the stithy, four of them strong knaves, and all
loving to their master.By night were scarce less desperate, for he hath
his doors strongly secured with bolt of oak and bar of iron, and ere the
fastenings of his house could be forced, the neighbourhood would rise to
his rescue, especially as they are still alarmed by the practice on St."Oh, ay, true, mediciner," said Ramorny, "for deceit is thy nature even
with me: thou knewest my hand and signet, as thou said'st, when that
hand was found cast out on the street, like the disgusting refuse of
a shambles--why, having such knowledge, went'st thou with these
jolterheaded citizens to consult that Patrick Charteris, whose spurs
should be hacked off from his heels for the communion which he holds
with paltry burghers, and whom thou brought'st here with the fools to do
dishonour to the lifeless hand, which, had it held its wonted place, he
was not worthy to have touched in peace or faced in war?""My noble patron, as soon as I had reason to know you had been the
sufferer, I urged them with all my powers of persuasion to desist from
prosecuting the feud; but the swaggering smith, and one or two other hot
heads, cried out for vengeance.Your knighthood must know this fellow
calls himself bachelor to the Fair Maiden of Perth, and stands upon his
honour to follow up her father's quarrel; but I have forestalled his
market in that quarter, and that is something in earnest of revenge.""How mean you by that, sir leech?""Your knighthood shall conceive," said the mediciner, "that this smith
doth not live within compass, but is an outlier and a galliard.Valentine's Day, shortly after the affray between the
townsfolk and the followers of Douglas.Yes, I met him sneaking through
the lanes and bye passages with a common minstrel wench, with her messan
and her viol on his one arm and her buxom self hanging upon the other.Is not this a trim squire, to cross a prince's
love with the fairest girl in Perth, strike off the hand of a knight and
baron, and become gentleman usher to a strolling glee woman, all in the
course of the same four and twenty hours?""Marry, I think the better of him that he has so much of a gentleman's
humour, clown though he be," said Ramorny."I would he had been a
precisian instead of a galliard, and I should have had better heart to
aid thy revenge.And such revenge!--revenge on a smith--in the quarrel
of a pitiful manufacturer of rotten cheverons!And yet it shall
be taken in full.Thou hast commenced it, I warrant me, by thine own
manoeuvres.""In a small degree only," said the apothecary."I took care that two or
three of the most notorious gossips in Curfew street, who liked not to
hear Catharine called the Fair Maid of Perth, should be possessed
of this story of her faithful Valentine.They opened on the scent so
keenly, that, rather than doubt had fallen on the tale, they would have
vouched for it as if their own eyes had seen it.The lover came to
her father's within an hour after, and your worship may think what a
reception he had from the angry glover, for the damsel herself would not
be looked upon.And thus your honour sees I had a foretaste of revenge.But I trust to receive the full draught from the hands of your lordship,
with whom I am in a brotherly league, which--"

"Brotherly!""But be it so, the priests
say we are all of one common earth.I cannot tell, there seems to me
some difference; but the better mould shall keep faith with the baser,
and thou shalt have thy revenge.A young man made his appearance from the anteroom upon the physician's
summons."Eviot," said the knight, "does Bonthron wait?"He is as sober as sleep can make him after a deep drink," answered the
page."Then fetch him hither, and do thou shut the door."A heavy step presently approached the apartment, and a man entered,
whose deficiency of height seemed made up in breadth of shoulders and
strength of arm."There is a man thou must deal upon, Bonthron," said the knight.The man
smoothed his rugged features and grinned a smile of satisfaction."That mediciner will show thee the party.Take such advantage of time,
place, and circumstance as will ensure the result; and mind you come not
by the worst, for the man is the fighting Smith of the Wynd.""It Will be a tough job," growled the assassin; "for if I miss my blow,
I may esteem myself but a dead man.All Perth rings with the smith's
skill and strength.""Take two assistants with thee," said the knight."If you double anything, let it be the reward.""Account it doubled," said his master; "but see thy work be thoroughly
executed.""Trust me for that, sir knight: seldom have I failed.""Use this sage man's directions," said the wounded knight, pointing to
the physician."And hark thee, await his coming forth, and drink not
till the business be done.""I will not," answered the dark satellite; "my own life depends on my
blow being steady and sure."Vanish, then, till he summons you, and have axe and dagger in
readiness.""Will your knighthood venture to entrust such an act to a single hand?"said the mediciner, when the assassin had left the room."May I pray you
to remember that yonder party did, two nights since, baffle six armed
men?""Question me not, sir mediciner: a man like Bonthron, who knows time and
place, is worth a score of confused revellers.Call Eviot; thou shalt
first exert thy powers of healing, and do not doubt that thou shalt,
in the farther work, be aided by one who will match thee in the art of
sudden and unexpected destruction."The page Eviot again appeared at the mediciner's summons, and at his
master's sign assisted the chirurgeon in removing the dressings from
Sir John Ramorny's wounded arm.Dwining viewed the naked stump with
a species of professional satisfaction, enhanced, no doubt, by the
malignant pleasure which his evil disposition took in the pain and
distress of his fellow creatures.The knight just turned his eye on the
ghastly spectacle, and uttered, under the pressure of bodily pain or
mental agony, a groan which he would fain have repressed."You groan, sir," said the leech, in his soft, insinuating tone of
voice, but with a sneer of enjoyment, mixed with scorn, curling upon
his lip, which his habitual dissimulation could not altogether
disguise--"you groan; but be comforted.This Henry Smith knows his
business: his sword is as true to its aim as his hammer to the anvil.Had a common swordsman struck this fatal blow, he had harmed the bone
and damaged the muscles, so that even my art might not have been able
to repair them.But Henry Smith's cut is clean, and as sure as that with
which my own scalpel could have made the amputation.In a few days you
will be able, with care and attention to the ordinances of medicine, to
stir abroad.""But my hand--the loss of my hand--"

"It may be kept secret for a time," said the mediciner."I have
possessed two or three tattling fools, in deep confidence, that the hand
which was found was that of your knighthood's groom, Black Quentin, and
your knighthood knows that he has parted for Fife, in such sort as to
make it generally believed.""I know well enough," said Ramorny, "that the rumour may stifle the
truth for a short time."It may be concealed till your knighthood retires for a time from the
court, and then, when new accidents have darkened the recollection
of the present stir, it may be imputed to a wound received from the
shivering of a spear, or from a crossbow bolt.Your slave will find a
suitable device, and stand for the truth of it.""The thought maddens me," said Ramorny, with another groan of mental and
bodily agony; "yet I see no better remedy.""There is none other," said the leech, to whose evil nature his patron's
distress was delicious nourishment.Mary journeyed to the bedroom."In the mean while, it is believed
you are confined by the consequences of some bruises, aiding the sense
of displeasure at the Prince's having consented to dismiss you from his
household at the remonstrance of Albany, which is publicly known.""Villain, thou rack'st me!""Upon the whole, therefore," said Dwining, "your knighthood has escaped
well, and, saving the lack of your hand, a mischance beyond remedy,
you ought rather to rejoice than complain; for no barber chirurgeon in
France or England could have more ably performed the operation than this
churl with one downright blow.""I understand my obligation fully," said Ramorny, struggling with his
anger, and affecting composure; "and if Bonthron pays him not with a
blow equally downright, and rendering the aid of the leech unnecessary,
say that John of Ramorny cannot requite an obligation.""That is spoke like yourself, noble knight!""And let me further say, that the operator's skill must have been
vain, and the hemorrhage must have drained your life veins, but for the
bandages, the cautery, and the styptics applied by the good monks, and
the poor services of your humble vassal, Henbane Dwining.""Peace," exclaimed the patient, "with thy ill omened voice and worse
omened name!Methinks, as thou mentionest the tortures I have undergone,
my tingling nerves stretch and contract themselves as if they still
actuated the fingers that once could clutch a dagger.""That," explained the leech, "may it please your knighthood, is a
phenomenon well known to our profession.There have been those among
the ancient sages who have thought that there still remained a sympathy
between the severed nerves and those belonging to the amputated
limb; and that the several fingers are seen to quiver and strain, as
corresponding with the impulse which proceeds from their sympathy with
the energies of the living system.Could we recover the hand from the
Cross, or from the custody of the Black Douglas, I would be pleased to
observe this wonderful operation of occult sympathies.But, I fear me,
one might as safely go to wrest the joint from the talons of an hungry
eagle.""And thou mayst as safely break thy malignant jests on a wounded lion as
on John of Ramorny," said the knight, raising himself in uncontrollable
indignation."Caitiff, proceed to thy duty; and remember, that if my
hand can no longer clasp a dagger, I can command an hundred.""The sight of one drawn and brandished in anger were sufficient," said
Dwining, "to consume the vital powers of your chirurgeon.But who then,"
he added in a tone partly insinuating, partly jeering--"who would then
relieve the fiery and scorching pain which my patron now suffers, and
which renders him exasperated even with his poor servant for quoting the
rules of healing, so contemptible, doubtless, compared with the power of
inflicting wounds?"Then, as daring no longer to trifle with the mood of his dangerous
patient, the leech addressed himself seriously to salving the wound,
and applied a fragrant balm, the odour of which was diffused through the
apartment, while it communicated a refreshing coolness, instead of the
burning heat--a change so gratifying to the fevered patient, that, as
he had before groaned with agony, he could not now help sighing for
pleasure, as he sank back on his couch to enjoy the ease which the
dressing bestowed."Your knightly lordship now knows who is your friend," said Dwining;
"had you yielded to a rash impulse, and said, 'Slay me this worthless
quacksalver,' where, within the four seas of Britain, would you have
found the man to have ministered to you as much comfort?""Forget my threats, good leech," said Ramorny, "and beware how you tempt
me.Such as I brook not jests upon our agony.See thou keep thy scoffs,
to pass upon misers [that is, miserable persons, as used in Spenser and
other writers of his time, though the sense is now restricted to those
who are covetous] in the hospital."Dwining ventured to say no more, but poured some drops from a phial
which he took from his pocket into a small cup of wine allayed with
water."This draught," said the man of art, "is medicated to produce a sleep
which must not be interrupted.""The period of its operation is uncertain--perhaps till morning.""Sir mediciner, taste me that
liquor presently, else it passes not my lips."The leech obeyed him, with a scornful smile."I would drink the whole
with readiness; but the juice of this Indian gum will bring sleep on the
healthy man as well as upon the patient, and the business of the leech
requires me to be a watcher.""I crave your pardon, sir leech," said Ramorny, looking downwards, as if
ashamed to have manifested suspicion."There is no room for pardon where offence must not be taken," answered
the mediciner."An insect must thank a giant that he does not tread on
him.Yet, noble knight, insects have their power of harming as well as
physicians.What would it have cost me, save a moment's trouble, so to
have drugged that balm, as should have made your arm rot to the shoulder
joint, and your life blood curdle in your veins to a corrupted jelly?What is there that prevented me to use means yet more subtle, and to
taint your room with essences, before which the light of life twinkles
more and more dimly, till it expires, like a torch amidst the foul
vapours of some subterranean dungeon?You little estimate my power, if
you know not that these and yet deeper modes of destruction stand
at command of my art.But a physician slays not the patient by whose
generosity he lives, and far less will he the breath of whose nostrils
is the hope of revenge destroy the vowed ally who is to favour his
pursuit of it.Yet one word; should a necessity occur for rousing
yourself--for who in Scotland can promise himself eight hours'
uninterrupted repose?--then smell at the strong essence contained in
this pouncet box.And now, farewell, sir knight; and if you cannot think
of me as a man of nice conscience, acknowledge me at least as one of
reason and of judgment."So saying, the mediciner left the room, his usual mean and shuffling
gait elevating itself into something more noble, as conscious of a
victory over his imperious patient.Sir John Ramorny remained sunk in unpleasing reflections until he began
to experience the incipient effects of his soporific draught.He then
roused himself for an instant, and summoned his page.I have done ill to unbosom myself so far to this
poisonous quacksalver."Yes, so please your knighthood.""Bonthron spoke apart with him, and followed him almost immediately--by
your lordship's command, as I understood him."he goes to seek some medicaments; he will return anon.If he be intoxicated, see he comes not near my chamber, and permit him
not to enter into converse with any one.He raves when drink has touched
his brain.He was a rare fellow before a Southron bill laid his brain
pan bare; but since that time he talks gibberish whenever the cup has
crossed his lips.Said the leech aught to you, Eviot?""Nothing, save to reiterate his commands that your honour be not
disturbed.""Which thou must surely obey," said the knight."I feel the summons to
rest, of which I have been deprived since this unhappy wound.At least,
if I have slept it has been but for a snatch.Aid me to take off my
gown, Eviot.""May God and the saints send you good rest, my lord," said the page,
retiring after he had rendered his wounded master the assistance
required.As Eviot left the room, the knight, whose brain was becoming more and
more confused, muttered over the page's departing salutation."God--saints--I have slept sound under such a benison.But now, methinks
if I awake not to the accomplishment of my proud hopes of power and
revenge, the best wish for me is, that the slumbers which now fall
around my head were the forerunners of that sleep which shall return
my borrowed powers to their original nonexistence--I can argue it no
farther."Thus speaking, he fell into a profound sleep.On Fastern's E'en when we war fou.The night which sunk down on the sickbed of Ramorny was not doomed to be
a quiet one.Two hours had passed since curfew bell, then rung at seven
o'clock at night, and in those primitive times all were retired to rest,
excepting such whom devotion, or duty, or debauchery made watchers; and
the evening being that of Shrovetide, or, as it was called in Scotland,
Fastern's E'en, the vigils of gaiety were by far the most frequented of
the three.The common people had, throughout the day, toiled and struggled at
football; the nobles and gentry had fought cocks, and hearkened to the
wanton music of the minstrel; while the citizens had gorged themselves
upon pancakes fried in lard, and brose, or brewis--the fat broth, that
is, in which salted beef had been boiled, poured upon highly toasted
oatmeal, a dish which even now is not ungrateful to simple, old
fashioned Scottish palates.These were all exercises and festive dishes
proper to the holiday.It was no less a solemnity of the evening that
the devout Catholic should drink as much good ale and wine as he had
means to procure; and, if young and able, that he should dance at the
ring, or figure among the morrice dancers, who, in the city of Perth,
as elsewhere, wore a peculiarly fantastic garb, and distinguished
themselves by their address and activity.All this gaiety took place
under the prudential consideration that the long term of Lent, now
approaching, with its fasts and deprivations, rendered it wise for
mortals to cram as much idle and sensual indulgence as they could into
the brief space which intervened before its commencement.The usual revels had taken place, and in most parts of the city were
succeeded by the usual pause.A particular degree of care had been
taken by the nobility to prevent any renewal of discord betwixt their
followers and the citizens of the town, so that the revels had proceeded
with fewer casualties than usual, embracing only three deaths and
certain fractured limbs, which, occurring to individuals of little
note, were not accounted worth inquiring into.The carnival was closing
quietly in general, but in some places the sport was still kept up.One company of revellers, who had been particularly noticed and
applauded, seemed unwilling to conclude their frolic.The entry, as it
was called, consisted of thirteen persons, habited in the same manner,
having doublets of chamois leather sitting close to their bodies,
curiously slashed and laced.They wore green caps with silver tassels,
red ribands, and white shoes, had bells hung at their knees and around
their ankles, and naked swords in their hands.This gallant party,
having exhibited a sword dance before the King, with much clashing of
weapons and fantastic interchange of postures, went on gallantly to
repeat their exhibition before the door of Simon Glover, where, having
made a fresh exhibition of their agility, they caused wine to be served
round to their own company and the bystanders, and with a loud shout
drank to the health of the Fair Maid of Perth.This summoned old Simon
to the door of his habitation, to acknowledge the courtesy of his
countrymen, and in his turn to send the wine around in honour of the
Merry Morrice Dancers of Perth."We thank thee, father Simon," said a voice, which strove to drown in an
artificial squeak the pert, conceited tone of Oliver Proudfute."But a
sight of thy lovely daughter had been more sweet to us young bloods than
a whole vintage of Malvoisie.""I thank thee, neighbours, for your goodwill," replied the glover."My
daughter is ill at ease, and may not come forth into the cold night air;
but if this gay gallant, whose voice methinks I should know, will go
into my poor house, she will charge him with thanks for the rest of
you.""Bring them to us at the hostelrie of the Griffin," cried the rest of
the ballet to their favoured companion; "for there will we ring in Lent,
and have another rouse to the health of the lovely Catharine.""Have with you in half an hour," said Oliver, "and see who will quaff
the largest flagon, or sing the loudest glee.Nay, I will be merry in
what remains of Fastern's Even, should Lent find me with my mouth closed
for ever.""Farewell, then," cried his mates in the morrice--"fare well, slashing
bonnet maker, till we meet again."The morrice dancers accordingly set out upon their further progress,
dancing and carolling as they went along to the sound of four musicians,
who led the joyous band, while Simon Glover drew their coryphaeus into
his house, and placed him in a chair by his parlour fire."She is the bait for us brave
blades.""Why, truly, she keeps her apartment, neighbour Oliver; and, to speak
plainly, she keeps her bed.""Why, then will I upstairs to see her in her sorrow; you have marred my
ramble, Gaffer Glover, and you owe me amends--a roving blade like me; I
will not lose both the lass and the glass."My dog and I we have a trick
     To visit maids when they are sick;
     When they are sick and like to die,
     Oh, thither do come my dog and I."And when I die, as needs must hap,
     Then bury me under the good ale tap;
     With folded arms there let me lie
     Cheek for jowl, my dog and I.""Canst thou not be serious for a moment, neighbour Proudfute?"said the
glover; "I want a word of conversation with you."answered his visitor; "why, I have been serious all this
day: I can hardly open my mouth, but something comes out about death, a
burial, or suchlike--the most serious subjects that I wot of."said the glover, "art then fey?""No, not a whit: it is not my own death which these gloomy fancies
foretell.I have a strong horoscope, and shall live for fifty years to
come.But it is the case of the poor fellow--the Douglas man, whom I
struck down at the fray of St.Valentine's: he died last night; it is
that which weighs on my conscience, and awakens sad fancies.Ah, father
Simon, we martialists, that have spilt blood in our choler, have dark
thoughts at times; I sometimes wish that my knife had cut nothing but
worsted thrums.""And I wish," said Simon, "that mine had cut nothing but buck's leather,
for it has sometimes cut my own fingers.But thou mayst spare thy
remorse for this bout: there was but one man dangerously hurt at the
affray, and it was he from whom Henry Smith hewed the hand, and he is
well recovered.His name is Black Quentin, one of Sir John Ramorny's
followers.He has been sent privately back to his own country of Fife."Why, that is the very man that Henry and I, as
we ever keep close together, struck at in the same moment, only my blow
fell somewhat earlier.I fear further feud will come of it, and so does
the provost.Why, then, I will be jovial, and since
thou wilt not let me see how Kate becomes her night gear, I will back to
the Griffin to my morrice dancers."Thou art a comrade of Henry Wynd, and hast
done him the service to own one or two deeds and this last among others.I would thou couldst clear him of other charges with which fame hath
loaded him.""Nay, I will swear by the hilt of my sword they are as false as hell,
father Simon.shall not men of the sword stick
together?""Nay, neighbour bonnet maker, be patient; thou mayst do the smith a kind
turn, an thou takest this matter the right way.I have chosen thee to
consult with anent this matter--not that I hold thee the wisest head in
Perth, for should I say so I should lie.""Ay--ay," answered the self satisfied bonnet maker; "I know where you
think my fault lies: you cool heads think we hot heads are fools--I have
heard men call Henry Wynd such a score of times.""Fool enough and cool enough may rhyme together passing well," said the
glover; "but thou art good natured, and I think lovest this crony of
thine.It stands awkwardly with us and him just now," continued Simon."Thou knowest there hath been some talk of marriage between my daughter
Catharine and Henry Gow?""I have heard some such song since St.he that
shall win the Fair Maid of Perth must be a happy man; and yet marriage
spoils many a pretty fellow.I myself somewhat regret--"

"Prithee, truce with thy regrets for the present, man," interrupted the
glover, somewhat peevishly."You must know, Oliver, that some of these
talking women, who I think make all the business of the world their
own, have accused Henry of keeping light company with glee women and
suchlike.Catharine took it to heart; and I held my child insulted, that
he had not waited upon her like a Valentine, but had thrown himself into
unseemly society on the very day when, by ancient custom, he might have
had an opportunity to press his interest with my daughter.Therefore,
when he came hither late on the evening of St.Valentine's, I, like a
hasty old fool, bid him go home to the company he had left, and denied
him admittance.I have not seen him since, and I begin to think that
I may have been too rash in the matter.She is my only child, and the
grave should have her sooner than a debauchee, But I have hitherto
thought I knew Henry Gow as if he were my son.I cannot think he would
use us thus, and it may be there are means of explaining what is laid
to his charge.I was led to ask Dwining, who is said to have saluted the
smith while he was walking with this choice mate.If I am to believe his
words, this wench was the smith's cousin, Joan Letham.But thou knowest
that the potter carrier ever speaks one language with his visage and
another with his tongue.Now, thou, Oliver, hast too little wit--I mean,
too much honesty--to belie the truth, and as Dwining hinted that thou
also hadst seen her--"

"I see her, Simon Glover!"No, not precisely that; but he says you told him you had met the smith
thus accompanied.""He lies, and I will pound him into a gallipot!"Did you never tell him, then, of such a meeting?""Did not he swear that he
would never repeat again to living mortal what I communicated to him?and therefore, in telling the occurrent to you, he hath made himself a
liar.""Thou didst not meet the smith, then," said Simon, "with such a loose
baggage as fame reports?""Lackaday, not I; perhaps I did, perhaps I did not.Think, father
Simon--I have been a four years married man, and can you expect me to
remember the turn of a glee woman's ankle, the trip of her toe, the lace
upon her petticoat, and such toys?No, I leave that to unmarried wags,
like my gossip Henry.""The upshot is, then," said the glover, much vexed, "you did meet him on
St.Valentine's Day walking the public streets--"

"Not so, neighbour; I met him in the most distant and dark lane in
Perth, steering full for his own house, with bag and baggage, which, as
a gallant fellow, he carried in his arms, the puppy dog on one and the
jilt herself--and to my thought she was a pretty one--hanging upon the
other."John," said the glover, "this infamy would make a
Christian man renounce his faith, and worship Mahound in very anger!But
he has seen the last of my daughter.I would rather she went to the wild
Highlands with a barelegged cateran than wed with one who could, at such
a season, so broadly forget honour and decency.father Simon," said the liberal minded bonnet maker, "you
consider not the nature of young blood.Their company was not long,
for--to speak truth, I did keep a little watch on him--I met him before
sunrise, conducting his errant damsel to the Lady's Stairs, that the
wench might embark on the Tay from Perth; and I know for certainty, for
I made inquiry, that she sailed in a gabbart for Dundee.So you see it
was but a slight escape of youth.""And he came here," said Simon, bitterly, "beseeching for admittance to
my daughter, while he had his harlot awaiting him at home!I had rather
he had slain a score of men!It skills not talking, least of all to
thee, Oliver Proudfute, who, if thou art not such a one as himself,
would fain be thought so.But--"

"Nay, think not of it so seriously," said Oliver, who began to reflect
on the mischief his tattling was likely to occasion to his friend, and
on the consequences of Henry Gow's displeasure, when he should learn
the disclosure which he had made rather in vanity of heart than in evil
intention."Consider," he continued, "that there are follies belonging to youth.Occasion provokes men to such frolics, and confession wipes them off.I
care not if I tell thee that, though my wife be as goodly a woman as the
city has, yet I myself--"

"Peace, silly braggart," said the glover in high wrath; "thy loves and
thy battles are alike apocryphal.If thou must needs lie, which I think
is thy nature, canst thou invent no falsehood that may at least do thee
some credit?Do I not see through thee, as I could see the light through
the horn of a base lantern?Do I not know, thou filthy weaver of rotten
worsted, that thou durst no more cross the threshold of thy own door, if
thy wife heard of thy making such a boast, than thou darest cross naked
weapons with a boy of twelve years old, who has drawn a sword for the
first time of his life?John, it were paying you for your tale
bearing trouble to send thy Maudie word of thy gay brags."The bonnet maker, at this threat, started as if a crossbow bolt had
whizzed past his head when least expected.And it was with a trembling
voice that he replied: "Nay, good father Glover, thou takest too much
credit for thy grey hairs.Consider, good neighbour, thou art too old
for a young martialist to wrangle with.And in the matter of my Maudie,
I can trust thee, for I know no one who would be less willing than thou
to break the peace of families.""Trust thy coxcomb no longer with me," said the incensed glover; "but
take thyself, and the thing thou call'st a head, out of my reach, lest I
borrow back five minutes of my youth and break thy pate!""You have had a merry Fastern's Even, neighbour," said the bonnet maker,
"and I wish you a quiet sleep; we shall meet better friends tomorrow.""I am ashamed so idle a
tongue as thine should have power to move me thus.""Idiot--beast--loose tongued coxcomb," he exclaimed, throwing himself
into a chair, as the bonnet maker disappeared; "that a fellow made up
of lies should not have had the grace to frame one when it might have
covered the shame of a friend!And I--what am I, that I should, in my
secret mind, wish that such a gross insult to me and my child had
been glossed over?Yet such was my opinion of Henry, that I would have
willingly believed the grossest figment the swaggering ass could have
invented.Our honest name must be
maintained, though everything else should go to ruin."While the glover thus moralised on the unwelcome confirmation of the
tale he wished to think untrue, the expelled morrice dancer had leisure,
in the composing air of a cool and dark February night, to meditate on
the consequences of the glover's unrestrained anger."But it is nothing," he bethought himself, "to the wrath of Henry Wynd,
who hath killed a man for much less than placing displeasure betwixt him
and Catharine, as well as her fiery old father.But the humour of seeming a knowing gallant, as
in truth I am, fairly overcame me.Were I best go to finish the revel
at the Griffin?But then Maudie will rampauge on my return--ay, and this
being holiday even, I may claim a privilege.I have it: I will not to
the Griffin--I will to the smith's, who must be at home, since no one
hath seen him this day amid the revel.I will endeavour to make peace
with him, and offer my intercession with the glover.Harry is a simple,
downright fellow, and though I think he is my better in a broil, yet
in discourse I can turn him my own way.The streets are now quiet, the
night, too, is dark, and I may step aside if I meet any rioters.I will
to the smith's, and, securing him for my friend, I care little for old
Simon.Ringan bear me well through this night, and I will clip my
tongue out ere it shall run my head into such peril again!Yonder old
fellow, when his blood was up, looked more like a carver of buff jerkins
than a clipper of kid gloves."With these reflections, the puissant Oliver walked swiftly, yet with as
little noise as possible, towards the wynd in which the smith, as our
readers are aware, had his habitation.But his evil fortune had not
ceased to pursue him.As he turned into the High, or principal, Street,
he heard a burst of music very near him, followed by a loud shout."My merry mates, the morrice dancers," thought he; "I would know old
Jeremy's rebeck among an hundred.I will venture across the street ere
they pass on; if I am espied, I shall have the renown of some private
quest, which may do me honour as a roving blade."With these longings for distinction among the gay and gallant, combated,
however, internally, by more prudential considerations, the bonnet maker
made an attempt to cross the street.But the revellers, whoever they
might be, were accompanied by torches, the flash of which fell upon
Oliver, whose light  habit made him the more distinctly visible.The general shout of "A prize--a prize" overcame the noise of the
minstrel, and before the bonnet maker could determine whether it were
better to stand or fly, two active young men, clad in fantastic masking
habits, resembling wild men, and holding great clubs, seized upon him,
saying, in a tragical tone: "Yield thee, man of bells and bombast--yield
thee, rescue or no rescue, or truly thou art but a dead morrice dancer."said the bonnet maker, with a faltering
voice; for, though he saw he had to do with a party of mummers who were
afoot for pleasure, yet he observed at the same time that they were far
above his class, and he lost the audacity necessary to support his part
in a game where the inferior was likely to come by the worst.answered one of the maskers; "and must I
show thee that thou art a captive, by giving thee incontinently the
bastinado?""By no means, puissant man of Ind," said the bonnet maker; "lo, I am
conformable to your pleasure.""Come, then," said those who had arrested him--"come and do homage
to the Emperor of Mimes, King of Caperers, and Grand Duke of the Dark
Hours, and explain by what right thou art so presumptuous as to prance
and jingle, and wear out shoe leather, within his dominions without
paying him tribute.Know'st thou not thou hast incurred the pains of
high treason?""That were hard, methinks," said poor Oliver, "since I knew not that his
Grace exercised the government this evening.But I am willing to redeem
the forfeit, if the purse of a poor bonnet maker may, by the mulct of a
gallon of wine, or some such matter.""Bring him before the emperor," was the universal cry; and the morrice
dancer was placed before a slight, but easy and handsome, figure of a
young man, splendidly attired, having a cincture and tiara of peacock's
feathers, then brought from the East as a marvellous rarity; a short
jacket and under dress of leopard's skin fitted closely the rest of his
person, which was attired in flesh  silk, so as to resemble the
ordinary idea of an Indian prince.He wore sandals, fastened on with
ribands of scarlet silk, and held in his hand a sort of fan, such as
ladies then used, composed of the same feathers, assembled into a plume
or tuft."What mister wight have we here," said the Indian chief, "who dares to
tie the bells of a morrice on the ankles of a dull ass?Hark ye, friend,
your dress should make you a subject of ours, since our empire extends
over all Merryland, including mimes and minstrels of every description.He lacks wine; minister to him our nutshell full of
sack."A huge calabash full of sack was offered to the lips of the supplicant,
while this prince of revellers exhorted him:

"Crack me this nut, and do it handsomely, and without wry faces."But, however Oliver might have relished a moderate sip of the same good
wine, he was terrified at the quantity he was required to deal with.He
drank a draught, and then entreated for mercy."So please your princedom, I have yet far to go, and if I were to
swallow your Grace's bounty, for which accept my dutiful thanks, I
should not be able to stride over the next kennel.""Art thou in case to bear thyself like a galliard?Now, cut me a
caper--ha!one--two--three--admirable.Again--give him the spur (here a
satellite of the Indian gave Oliver a slight touch with his sword).Nay,
that is best of all: he sprang like a cat in a gutter.Tender him the
nut once more; nay, no compulsion, he has paid forfeit, and deserves not
only free dismissal but reward.Kneel down--kneel, and arise Sir Knight
of the Calabash!And one of you lend me a rapier.""Oliver, may it please your honour--I mean your principality."Nay, then thou art one of the 'douze peers' already, and
fate has forestalled our intended promotion.Yet rise up, sweet Sir
Oliver Thatchpate, Knight of the honourable order of the Pumpkin--rise
up, in the name of nonsense, and begone about thine own concerns, and
the devil go with thee!"So saying, the prince of the revels bestowed a smart blow with the flat
of the weapon across the bonnet maker's shoulders, who sprung to his
feet with more alacrity of motion than he had hitherto displayed, and,
accelerated by the laugh and halloo which arose behind him, arrived at
the smith's house before he stopped, with the same speed with which a
hunted fox makes for his den.It was not till the affrighted bonnet maker had struck a blow on the
door that he recollected he ought to have bethought himself beforehand
in what manner he was to present himself before Henry, and obtain his
forgiveness for his rash communications to Simon Glover.No one answered
to his first knock, and, perhaps, as these reflections arose in the
momentary pause of recollection which circumstances permitted, the
perplexed bonnet maker might have flinched from his purpose, and made
his retreat to his own premises, without venturing upon the interview
which he had purposed.But a distant strain of minstrelsy revived his
apprehensions of falling once more into the hands of the gay maskers
from whom he had escaped, and he renewed his summons on the door of the
smith's dwelling with a hurried, though faltering, hand.He was then
appalled by the deep, yet not unmusical, voice of Henry Gow, who
answered from within: "Who calls at this hour, and what is it that you
want?""It is I--Oliver Proudfute," replied the bonnet maker; "I have a merry
jest to tell you, gossip Henry.""Carry thy foolery to some other market.I am in no jesting humour,"
said Henry."Go hence; I will see no one tonight.""But, gossip--good gossip," answered the martialist with out, "I am
beset with villains, and beg the shelter of your roof!"replied Henry; "no dunghill cock, the most
recreant that has fought this Fastern's Eve, would ruffle his feathers
at such a craven as thou!"At this moment another strain of minstrelsy, and, as the bonnet maker
conceited, one which approached much nearer, goaded his apprehensions
to the uttermost; and in a voice the tones of which expressed the
undisguised extremity of instant fear he exclaimed:

"For the sake of our old gossipred, and for the love of Our Blessed
Lady, admit me, Henry, if you would not have me found a bloody corpse at
thy door, slain by the bloody minded Douglasses!""That would be a shame to me," thought the good natured smith, "and
sooth to say, his peril may be real.There are roving hawks that will
strike at a sparrow as soon as a heron."With these reflections, half muttered, half spoken, Henry undid his well
fastened door, proposing to reconnoitre the reality of the danger before
he permitted his unwelcome guest to enter the house.But as he looked
abroad to ascertain how matters stood, Oliver bolted in like a scared
deer into a thicket, and harboured himself by the smith's kitchen fire
before Henry could look up and down the lane, and satisfy himself there
were no enemies in pursuit of the apprehensive fugitive.He secured his
door, therefore, and returned into the kitchen, displeased that he had
suffered his gloomy solitude to be intruded upon by sympathising with
apprehensions which he thought he might have known were so easily
excited as those of his timid townsman.he said, coldly enough, when he saw the bonnet maker calmly
seated by his hearth."What foolish revel is this, Master Oliver?I see
no one near to harm you.""Give me a drink, kind gossip," said Oliver: "I am choked with the haste
I have made to come hither.""I have sworn," said Henry, "that this shall be no revel night in this
house: I am in my workday clothes, as you see, and keep fast, as I have
reason, instead of holiday.You have had wassail enough for the holiday
evening, for you speak thick already.If you wish more ale or wine you
must go elsewhere.""I have had overmuch wassail already," said poor Oliver, "and have been
well nigh drowned in it.A draught of water,
kind gossip--you will not surely let me ask for that in vain?or, if it
is your will, a cup of cold small ale.""Nay, if that be all," said Henry, "it shall not be lacking.But it must
have been much which brought thee to the pass of asking for either."So saying, he filled a quart flagon from a barrel that stood nigh, and
presented it to his guest.Oliver eagerly accepted it, raised it to
his head with a trembling hand, imbibed the contents with lips which
quivered with emotion, and, though the potation was as thin as he had
requested, so much was he exhausted with the combined fears of alarm and
of former revelry, that, when he placed the flagon on the oak table, he
uttered a deep sigh of satisfaction, and remained silent."Well, now you have had your draught, gossip," said the smith, "what is
it you want?"No--but there were twenty chased me into the wynd," said Oliver."But
when they saw us together, you know they lost the courage that brought
all of them upon one of us.""Nay, do not trifle, friend Oliver," replied his host; "my mood lies not
that way."I have been stayed and foully
outraged (gliding his hand sensitively over the place affected) by mad
David of Rothsay, roaring Ramorny, and the rest of them.They made me
drink a firkin of Malvoisie."Ramorny is sick nigh to death, as the potter
carrier everywhere reports: they and he cannot surely rise at midnight
to do such frolics.""I cannot tell," replied Oliver; "but I saw the party by torchlight,
and I can make bodily oath to the bonnets I made for them since last
Innocents'.They are of a quaint device, and I should know my own
stitch.""Well, thou mayst have had wrong," answered Henry."If thou art in real
danger, I will cause them get a bed for thee here.But you must fill it
presently, for I am not in the humour of talking.""Nay, I would thank thee for my quarters for a night, only my Maudie
will be angry--that is, not angry, for that I care not for--but the
truth is, she is overanxious on a revel night like this, knowing my
humour is like thine for a word and a blow.""Why, then, go home," said the smith, "and show her that her treasure is
in safety, Master Oliver; the streets are quiet, and, to speak a blunt
word, I would be alone.""Nay, but I have things to speak with thee about of moment," replied
Oliver, who, afraid to stay, seemed yet unwilling to go."There has been
a stir in our city council about the affair of St.The
provost told me not four hours since, that the Douglas and he had agreed
that the feud should be decided by a yeoman on either party and that our
acquaintance, the Devil's Dick, was to wave his gentry, and take up the
cause for Douglas and the nobles, and that you or I should fight for the
Fair City.Now, though I am the elder burgess, yet I am willing, for the
love and kindness we have always borne to each other, to give thee the
precedence, and content myself with the humbler office of stickler."Henry Smith, though angry, could scarce forbear a smile."If it is that which breaks thy quiet, and keeps thee out of thy bed at
midnight, I will make the matter easy.Thou shalt not lose the advantage
offered thee.I have fought a score of duels--far, far too many.Thou hast, I think, only encountered with thy wooden soldan: it were
unjust--unfair--unkind--in me to abuse thy friendly offer.So go home,
good fellow, and let not the fear of losing honour disturb thy slumbers.Rest assured that thou shalt answer the challenge, as good right thou
hast, having had injury from this rough rider.""Gramercy, and thank thee kindly," said Oliver much embarrassed by his
friend's unexpected deference; "thou art the good friend I have always
thought thee.But I have as much friendship for Henry Smith as he for
Oliver Proudfute.John, I will not fight in this
quarrel to thy prejudice; so, having said so, I am beyond the reach of
temptation, since thou wouldst not have me mansworn, though it were to
fight twenty duels.""Hark thee," said the smith, "acknowledge thou art afraid, Oliver: tell
the honest truth, at once, otherwise I leave thee to make the best of
thy quarrel.""Nay, good gossip," replied the bonnet maker, "thou knowest I am never
afraid.But, in sooth, this is a desperate ruffian; and as I have a
wife--poor Maudie, thou knowest--and a small family, and thou--"

"And I," interrupted Henry, hastily, "have none, and never shall have.""Why, truly, such being the case, I would rather thou fought'st this
combat than I.""Now, by our halidome, gossip," answered the smith, "thou art easily
gored!Know, thou silly fellow, that Sir Patrick Charteris, who is ever
a merry man, hath but jested with thee.Dost thou think he would venture
the honour of the city on thy head, or that I would yield thee the
precedence in which such a matter was to be disputed?Lackaday, go home,
let Maudie tie a warm nightcap on thy head, get thee a warm breakfast
and a cup of distilled waters, and thou wilt be in ease tomorrow to
fight thy wooden dromond, or soldan, as thou call'st him, the only thing
thou wilt ever lay downright blow upon.""Ay, say'st thou so, comrade?"answered Oliver, much relieved, yet
deeming it necessary to seem in part offended."I care not for thy
dogged humour; it is well for thee thou canst not wake my patience to
the point of falling foul.Enough--we are gossips, and this house is
thine.Why should the two best blades in Perth clash with each other?I know thy rugged humour, and can forgive it.But is the feud
really soldered up?""As completely as ever hammer fixed rivet," said the smith."The town
hath given the Johnstone a purse of gold, for not ridding them of a
troublesome fellow called Oliver Proudfute, when he had him at his
mercy; and this purse of gold buys for the provost the Sleepless Isle,
which the King grants him, for the King pays all in the long run.And
thus Sir Patrick gets the comely inch which is opposite to his dwelling,
and all honour is saved on both sides, for what is given to the provost
is given, you understand, to the town.Besides all this, the Douglas
hath left Perth to march against the Southron, who, men say, are called
into the marches by the false Earl of March.So the Fair City is quit of
him and his cumber."John's name, how came all that about," said Oliver, "and no
one spoken to about it?""Why, look thee, friend Oliver, this I take to have been the case.The
fellow whom I cropped of a hand is now said to have been a servant of
Sir John Ramorny's, who hath fled to his motherland of Fife, to which
Sir John himself is also to be banished, with full consent of every
honest man.Now, anything which brings in Sir John Ramorny touches
a much greater man--I think Simon Glover told as much to Sir Patrick
Charteris.If it be as I guess, I have reason to thank Heaven and all
the saints I stabbed him not upon the ladder when I made him prisoner.""And I too thank Heaven and all the saints, most devoutly," said Oliver."I was behind thee, thou knowest, and--"

"No more of that, if thou be'st wise.There are laws against striking
princes," said the smith: "best not handle the horseshoe till it cools."If this be so," said Oliver, partly disconcerted, but still more
relieved, by the intelligence he received from his better informed
friend, "I have reason to complain of Sir Patrick Charteris for jesting
with the honour of an honest burgess, being, as he is, provost of our
town.""Do, Oliver; challenge him to the field, and he will bid his yeoman
loose his dogs on thee.But come, night wears apace, will you be
shogging?""Nay, I had one word more to say to thee, good gossip.But first,
another cup of your cold ale."Thou makest me wish thee where told liquors
are a scarce commodity.There, swill the barrelful an thou wilt."Oliver took the second flagon, but drank, or rather seemed to drink,
very slowly, in order to gain time for considering how he should
introduce his second subject of conversation, which seemed rather
delicate for the smith's present state of irritability.At length,
nothing better occurred to him than to plunge into the subject at once,
with, "I have seen Simon Glover today, gossip.""Well," said the smith, in a low, deep, and stern tone of voice, "and if
thou hast, what is that to me?""Nothing--nothing," answered the appalled bonnet maker."Only I thought
you might like to know that he questioned me close if I had seen thee
on St.Valentine's Day, after the uproar at the Dominicans', and in what
company thou wert.""And I warrant thou told'st him thou met'st me with a glee woman in the
mirk loaning yonder?""Thou know'st, Henry, I have no gift at lying; but I made it all up with
him.""Marry, thus: 'Father Simon,' said I, 'you are an old man, and know not
the quality of us, in whose veins youth is like quicksilver.You think,
now, he cares about this girl,' said I, 'and, perhaps, that he has her
somewhere here in Perth in a corner?No such matter; I know,' said I,
'and I will make oath to it, that she left his house early next morning
for Dundee.'"Truly, I think thou hast, and if anything could add to my grief and
vexation at this moment, it is that, when I am so deep in the mire,
an ass like thee should place his clumsy hoof on my head, to sink me
entirely.Come, away with thee, and mayst thou have such luck as thy
meddling humour deserves; and then I think, thou wilt be found with a
broken neck in the next gutter.Come, get you out, or I will put you to
the door with head and shoulders forward."exclaimed Oliver, laughing with some constraint, "thou art
such a groom!But in sadness, gossip Henry, wilt thou not take a turn
with me to my own house, in the Meal Vennel?""Curse thee, no," answered the smith."I will bestow the wine on thee if thou wilt go," said Oliver."I will bestow the cudgel on thee if thou stay'st," said Henry."Nay, then, I will don thy buff coat and cap of steel, and walk with thy
swashing step, and whistling thy pibroch of 'Broken Bones at Loncarty';
and if they take me for thee, there dare not four of them come near me.""Take all or anything thou wilt, in the fiend's name!"Well--well, Hal, we shall meet when thou art in better humour," said
Oliver, who had put on the dress."Go; and may I never see thy coxcombly face again."Oliver at last relieved his host by swaggering off, imitating as well as
he could the sturdy step and outward gesture of his redoubted companion,
and whistling a pibroch composed on the rout of the Danes at Loncarty,
which he had picked up from its being a favourite of the smith's, whom
he made a point of imitating as far as he could.But as the innocent,
though conceited, fellow stepped out from the entrance of the wynd,
where it communicated with the High Street, he received a blow from
behind, against which his headpiece was no defence, and he fell dead
upon the spot, an attempt to mutter the name of Henry, to whom he always
looked for protection, quivering upon his dying tongue.Nay, I will fit you for a young prince.We return to the revellers, who had, half an hour before, witnessed,
with such boisterous applause, Oliver's feat of agility, being the
last which the poor bonnet maker was ever to exhibit, and at the hasty
retreat which had followed it, animated by their wild shout.After they
had laughed their fill, they passed on their mirthful path in frolic and
jubilee, stopping and frightening some of the people whom they met, but,
it must be owned, without doing them any serious injury, either in their
persons or feelings.At length, tired with his rambles, their chief gave
a signal to his merry men to close around him."We, my brave hearts and wise counsellors, are," he said, "the real king
over all in Scotland that is worth commanding.We sway the hours when
the wine cup circulates, and when beauty becomes kind, when frolic is
awake, and gravity snoring upon his pallet.We leave to our vice regent,
King Robert, the weary task of controlling ambitious nobles, gratifying
greedy clergymen, subduing wild Highlanders, and composing deadly feuds.And since our empire is one of joy and pleasure, meet it is that we
should haste with all our forces to the rescue of such as own our sway,
when they chance, by evil fortune, to become the prisoners of care and
hypochondriac malady.I speak in relation chiefly to Sir John, whom the
vulgar call Ramorny.We have not seen him since the onslaught of Curfew
Street, and though we know he was somedeal hurt in that matter, we
cannot see why he should not do homage in leal and duteous sort.Here,
you, our Calabash King at arms, did you legally summon Sir John to his
part of this evening's revels?""And did you acquaint him that we have for this night suspended his
sentence of banishment, that, since higher powers have settled that
part, we might at least take a mirthful leave of an old friend?""I so delivered it, my lord," answered the mimic herald."And sent he not a word in writing, he that piques himself upon being so
great a clerk?""He was in bed, my lord, and I might not see him.So far as I hear, he
hath lived very retired, harmed with some bodily bruises, malcontent
with your Highness's displeasure, and doubting insult in the streets, he
having had a narrow escape from the burgesses, when the churls pursued
him and his two servants into the Dominican convent.The servants, too,
have been removed to Fife, lest they should tell tales.""Why, it was wisely done," said the Prince, who, we need not inform the
intelligent reader, had a better title to be so called than arose from
the humours of the evening--"it was prudently done to keep light tongued
companions out of the way.John's absenting himself from our
solemn revels, so long before decreed, is flat mutiny and disclamation
of allegiance.Or, if the knight be really the prisoner of illness and
melancholy, we must ourself grace him with a visit, seeing there can be
no better cure for those maladies than our own presence, and a gentle
kiss of the calabash.Forward, ushers, minstrels, guard, and attendants!Bear on high the great emblem of our dignity.Up with the calabash, I
say, and let the merry men who carry these firkins, which are to supply
the wine cup with their life blood, be chosen with regard to their state
of steadiness.Their burden is weighty and precious, and if the fault
is not in our eyes, they seem to us to reel and stagger more than were
desirable.Now, move on, sirs, and let our minstrels blow their blythest
and boldest."On they went with tipsy mirth and jollity, the numerous torches flashing
their red light against the small windows of the narrow streets, from
whence nightcapped householders, and sometimes their wives to boot,
peeped out by stealth to see what wild wassail disturbed the peaceful
streets at that unwonted hour.At length the jolly train halted before
the door of Sir John Ramorny's house, which a small court divided from
the street.Here they knocked, thundered, and halloo'd, with many denunciations of
vengeance against the recusants who refused to open the gates.The least
punishment threatened was imprisonment in an empty hogshead, within the
massamore [principal dungeon] of the Prince of Pastimes' feudal palace,
videlicet, the ale cellar.But Eviot, Ramorny's page, heard and knew
well the character of the intruders who knocked so boldly, and thought
it better, considering his master's condition, to make no answer at
all, in hopes that the revel would pass on, than to attempt to deprecate
their proceedings, which he knew would be to no purpose.His master's
bedroom looking into a little garden, his page hoped he might not be
disturbed by the noise; and he was confident in the strength of the
outward gate, upon which he resolved they should beat till they tired
themselves, or till the tone of their drunken humour should change.The
revellers accordingly seemed likely to exhaust themselves in the noise
they made by shouting and beating the door, when their mock prince
(alas!too really such) upbraided them as lazy and dull followers of the
god of wine and of mirth."Bring forward," he said, "our key, yonder it lies, and apply it to this
rebellious gate."The key he pointed at was a large beam of wood, left on one side of the
street, with the usual neglect of order characteristic of a Scottish
borough of the period.The shouting men of Ind instantly raised it in their arms, and,
supporting it by their united strength, ran against the door with such
force, that hasp, hinge, and staple jingled, and gave fair promise of
yielding.Eviot did not choose to wait the extremity of this battery: he
came forth into the court, and after some momentary questions for form's
sake, caused the porter to undo the gate, as if he had for the first
time recognised the midnight visitors."False slave of an unfaithful master," said the Prince, "where is our
disloyal subject, Sir John Ramorny, who has proved recreant to our
summons?""My lord," said Eviot, bowing at once to the real and to the assumed
dignity of the leader, "my master is just now very much indisposed: he
has taken an opiate--and--your Highness must excuse me if I do my duty
to him in saying, he cannot be spoken with without danger of his life."tell me not of danger, Master Teviot--Cheviot--Eviot--what is it
they call thee?But show me thy master's chamber, or rather undo me the
door of his lodging, and I will make a good guess at it myself.Bear
high the calabash, my brave followers, and see that you spill not a drop
of the liquor, which Dan Bacchus has sent for the cure of all diseases
of the body and cares of the mind.Advance it, I say, and let us see the
holy rind which incloses such precious liquor."The Prince made his way into the house accordingly, and, acquainted
with its interior, ran upstairs, followed by Eviot, in vain imploring
silence, and, with the rest of the rabble rout, burst into the room of
the wounded master of the lodging.He who has experienced the sensation of being compelled to sleep in
spite of racking bodily pains by the administration of a strong opiate,
and of having been again startled by noise and violence out of the
unnatural state of insensibility in which he had been plunged by the
potency of the medicine, may be able to imagine the confused and alarmed
state of Sir John Ramorny's mind, and the agony of his body, which
acted and reacted upon each other.If we add to these feelings the
consciousness of a criminal command, sent forth and in the act of being
executed, it may give us some idea of an awakening to which, in the mind
of the party, eternal sleep would be a far preferable doom.The groan
which he uttered as the first symptom of returning sensation had
something in it so terrific, that even the revellers were awed into
momentary silence; and as, from the half recumbent posture in which
he had gone to sleep, he looked around the room, filled with fantastic
shapes, rendered still more so by his disturbed intellects, he muttered
to himself:

"It is thus, then, after all, and the legend is true!These are fiends,
and I am condemned for ever!The fire is not external, but I feel it--I
feel it at my heart--burning as if the seven times heated furnace were
doing its work within!"While he cast ghastly looks around him, and struggled to recover some
share of recollection, Eviot approached the Prince, and, falling on his
knees, implored him to allow the apartment to be cleared."It may," he said, "cost my master his life.""Never fear, Cheviot," replied the Duke of Rothsay; "were he at the
gates of death, here is what should make the fiends relinquish their
prey.Advance the calabash, my masters.""It is death for him to taste it in his present state," said Eviot: "if
he drinks wine he dies.""Some one must drink it for him--he shall be cured vicariously; and
may our great Dan Bacchus deign to Sir John Ramorny the comfort, the
elevation of heart, the lubrication of lungs, and lightness of fancy,
which are his choicest gifts, while the faithful follower, who quaffs
in his stead, shall have the qualms, the sickness, the racking of the
nerves, the dimness of the eyes, and the throbbing of the brain, with
which our great master qualifies gifts which would else make us too like
the gods.will you be the faithful follower that
will quaff in your lord's behalf, and as his representative?Do this,
and we will hold ourselves contented to depart, for, methinks, our
subject doth look something ghastly.""I would do anything in my slight power," said Eviot, "to save my master
from a draught which may be his death, and your Grace from the sense
that you had occasioned it.But here is one who will perform the feat of
goodwill, and thank your Highness to boot."said the Prince, "a butcher, and I think fresh from
his office.Do butchers ply their craft on Fastern's Eve?Foh, how he
smells of blood!"This was spoken of Bonthron, who, partly surprised at the tumult in the
house, where he had expected to find all dark and silent, and partly
stupid through the wine which the wretch had drunk in great quantities,
stood in the threshold of the door, staring at the scene before him,
with his buff coat splashed with blood, and a bloody axe in his hand,
exhibiting a ghastly and disgusting spectacle to the revellers, who
felt, though they could not tell why, fear as well as dislike at his
presence.As they approached the calabash to this ungainly and truculent looking
savage, and as he extended a hand soiled as it seemed with blood, to
grasp it, the Prince called out:

"Downstairs with him!let not the wretch drink in our presence; find him
some other vessel than our holy calabash, the emblem of our revels: a
swine's trough were best, if it could be come by.let him
be drenched to purpose, in atonement for his master's sobriety.Leave me
alone with Sir John Ramorny and his page; by my honour, I like not yon
ruffian's looks."The attendants of the Prince left the apartment, and Eviot alone
remained."I fear," said the Prince, approaching the bed in different form from
that which he had hitherto used--"I fear, my dear Sir John, that this
visit has been unwelcome; but it is your own fault.Although you know
our old wont, and were your self participant of our schemes for the
evening, you have not come near us since St.Valentine's; it is now
Fastern's Even, and the desertion is flat disobedience and treason to
our kingdom of mirth and the statutes of the calabash."Ramorny raised his head, and fixed a wavering eye upon the Prince; then
signed to Eviot to give him something to drink.A large cup of ptisan
was presented by the page, which the sick man swallowed with eager and
trembling haste.He then repeatedly used the stimulating essence left
for the purpose by the leech, and seemed to collect his scattered
senses."Let me feel your pulse, dear Ramorny," said the Prince; "I know
something of that craft.Do your offer me the left hand, Sir John?that is neither according to the rules of medicine nor of courtesy.""The right has already done its last act in your Highness's service,"
muttered the patient in a low and broken tone."I am aware thy follower, Black
Quentin, lost a hand; but he can steal with the other as much as will
bring him to the gallows, so his fate cannot be much altered.""It is not that fellow who has had the loss in your Grace's service: it
is I, John of Ramorny."said the Prince; "you jest with me, or the opiate still masters
your reason.""If the juice of all the poppies in Egypt were blended in one draught,"
said Ramorny, "it would lose influence over me when I look upon this."He drew his right arm from beneath the cover of the bedclothes, and
extending it towards the Prince, wrapped as it was in dressings, "Were
these undone and removed," he said, "your Highness would see that a
bloody stump is all that remains of a hand ever ready to unsheath the
sword at your Grace's slightest bidding.""This," he said, "must be avenged!""It is avenged in small part," said Ramorny--"that is, I thought I saw
Bonthron but now; or was it that the dream of hell that first arose in
my mind when I awakened summoned up an image so congenial?Eviot, call
the miscreant--that is, if he is fit to appear."Eviot retired, and presently returned with Bonthron, whom he had rescued
from the penance, to him no unpleasing infliction, of a second calabash
of wine, the brute having gorged the first without much apparent
alteration in his demeanour."Eviot," said the Prince, "let not that beast come nigh me.My soul
recoils from him in fear and disgust: there is something in his looks
alien from my nature, and which I shudder at as at a loathsome snake,
from which my instinct revolts.""First hear him speak, my lord," answered Ramorny; "unless a wineskin
were to talk, nothing could use fewer words.Hast thou dealt with him,
Bonthron?"The savage raised the axe which he still held in his hand, and brought
it down again edgeways.the night, I am told, is dark.""By sight and sound, garb, gait, and whistle."and, Eviot, let him have gold and wine to his brutish
contentment.said the Prince, released from the
feelings of disgust and horror under which he suffered while the
assassin was in presence."I trust this is but a jest!Else must I call
it a rash and savage deed.Who has had the hard lot to be butchered by
that bloody and brutal slave?""One little better than himself," said the patient, "a wretched artisan,
to whom, however, fate gave the power of reducing Ramorny to a mutilated
<DW36>--a curse go with his base spirit!His miserable life is but
to my revenge what a drop of water would be to a furnace.I must speak
briefly, for my ideas again wander: it is only the necessity of the
moment which keeps them together; as a thong combines a handful of
arrows.You are in danger, my lord--I speak it with certainty: you have
braved Douglas, and offended your uncle, displeased your father, though
that were a trifle, were it not for the rest.""I am sorry I have displeased my father," said the Prince, entirely
diverted from so insignificant a thing as the slaughter of an artisan by
the more important subject touched upon, "if indeed it be so.But if
I live, the strength of the Douglas shall be broken, and the craft of
Albany shall little avail him!"My lord," said Ramorny, "with such opposites as you have,
you must not rest upon if or but; you must resolve at once to slay or be
slain."Your fever makes you rave" answered the Duke of
Rothsay."No, my lord," said Ramorny, "were my frenzy at the highest, the
thoughts that pass through my mind at this moment would qualify it.It
may be that regret for my own loss has made me desperate, that anxious
thoughts for your Highness's safety have made me nourish bold designs;
but I have all the judgment with which Heaven has gifted me, when I tell
you that, if ever you would brook the Scottish crown, nay, more, if ever
you would see another St.Valentine's Day, you must--"

"What is it that I must do, Ramorny?"said the Prince, with an air of
dignity; "nothing unworthy of myself, I hope?""Nothing, certainly, unworthy or misbecoming a prince of Scotland, if
the bloodstained annals of our country tell the tale truly; but that
which may well shock the nerves of a prince of mimes and merry makers.""Thou art severe, Sir John Ramorny," said the Duke of Rothsay, with an
air of displeasure; "but thou hast dearly bought a right to censure us
by what thou hast lost in our cause.""My Lord of Rothsay," said the knight, "the chirurgeon who dressed this
mutilated stump told me that the more I felt the pain his knife and
brand inflicted, the better was my chance of recovery.I shall not,
therefore, hesitate to hurt your feelings, while by doing so I may be
able to bring you to a sense of what is necessary for your safety.Your
Grace has been the pupil of mirthful folly too long; you must now assume
manly policy, or be crushed like a butterfly on the bosom of the flower
you are sporting on.""I think I know your cast of morals, Sir John: you are weary of merry
folly--the churchmen call it vice--and long for a little serious crime.A murder, now, or a massacre, would enhance the flavour of debauch, as
the taste of the olive gives zest to wine.But my worst acts are but
merry malice: I have no relish for the bloody trade, and abhor to see or
hear of its being acted even on the meanest caitiff.Should I ever fill
the throne, I suppose, like my father before me, I must drop my own
name, and be dubbed Robert, in honour of the Bruce; well, an if it be
so, every Scots lad shall have his flag on in one hand and the other
around his lass's neck, and manhood shall be tried by kisses and
bumpers, not by dirks and dourlachs; and they shall write on my grave,
'Here lies Robert, fourth of his name.He won not battles like Robert
the First.He rose not from a count to a king like Robert the Second.He founded not churches like Robert the Third, but was contented to live
and die king of good fellows!'Of all my two centuries of ancestors, I
would only emulate the fame of--

"Old King Coul, Who had a brown bowl.""My gracious lord," said Ramorny, "let me remind you that your joyous
revels involve serious evils.If I had lost this hand in fighting to
attain for your Grace some important advantage over your too powerful
enemies, the loss would never have grieved me.But to be reduced from
helmet and steel coat to biggin and gown in a night brawl--"

"Why, there again now, Sir John," interrupted the reckless Prince."How
canst thou be so unworthy as to be for ever flinging thy bloody hand in
my face, as the ghost of Gaskhall threw his head at Sir William Wallace?Bethink thee, thou art more unreasonable than Fawdyon himself; for wight
Wallace had swept his head off in somewhat a hasty humour, whereas I
would gladly stick thy hand on again, were that possible.And, hark
thee, since that cannot be, I will get thee such a substitute as the
steel hand of the old knight of Carslogie, with which he greeted his
friends, caressed his wife, braved his antagonists, and did all that
might be done by a hand of flesh and blood, in offence or defence.Depend on it, John Ramorny, we have much that is superfluous about us.Man can see with one eye, hear with one ear, touch with one hand, smell
with one nostril; and why we should have two of each, unless to supply
an accidental loss or injury, I for one am at a loss to conceive."Sir John Ramorny turned from the Prince with a low groan."Nay, Sir John;" said the Duke, "I am quite serious.You know the truth
touching the legend of Steel Hand of Carslogie better than I, since he
was your own neighbour.In his time that curious engine could only be
made in Rome; but I will wager an hundred marks with you that, let the
Perth armourer have the use of it for a pattern, Henry of the Wynd
will execute as complete an imitation as all the smiths in Rome could
accomplish, with all the cardinals to bid a blessing on the work.""I could venture to accept your wager, my lord," answered Ramorny,
bitterly, "but there is no time for foolery.You have dismissed me from
your service, at command of your uncle?""At command of my father," answered the Prince."Upon whom your uncle's commands are imperative," replied Ramorny."I
am a disgraced man, thrown aside, as I may now fling away my right hand
glove, as a thing useless.Yet my head might help you, though my hand
be gone.Is your Grace disposed to listen to me for one word of serious
import, for I am much exhausted, and feel my force sinking under me?""Speak your pleasure," said the Prince; "thy loss binds me to hear
thee, thy bloody stump is a sceptre to control me.Speak, then, but be
merciful in thy strength of privilege.""I will be brief for mine own sake as well as thine; indeed, I have but
little to say.Douglas places himself immediately at the head of his
vassals.He will assemble, in the name of King Robert, thirty thousand
Borderers, whom he will shortly after lead into the interior, to demand
that the Duke of Rothsay receive, or rather restore, his daughter to
the rank and privileges of his Duchess.King Robert will yield to any
conditions which may secure peace."The Duke of Rothsay loves peace," said the Prince, haughtily; "but he
never feared war.Ere he takes back yonder proud peat to his table
and his bed, at the command of her father, Douglas must be King of
Scotland.""Be it so; but even this is the less pressing peril, especially as it
threatens open violence, for the Douglas works not in secret.""What is there which presses, and keeps us awake at this late hour?I am
a weary man, thou a wounded one, and the very tapers are blinking, as if
tired of our conference.""Tell me, then, who is it that rules this kingdom of Scotland?""Robert, third of the name," said the Prince, raising his bonnet as he
spoke; "and long may he sway the sceptre!""True, and amen," answered Ramorny; "but who sways King Robert, and
dictates almost every measure which the good King pursues?""My Lord of Albany, you would say," replied the Prince."Yes, it is true
my father is guided almost entirely by the counsels of his brother; nor
can we blame him in our consciences, Sir John Ramorny, for little help
hath he had from his son.""Let us help him now, my lord," said Ramorny."I am possessor of a
dreadful secret: Albany hath been trafficking with me, to join him
in taking your Grace's life!He offers full pardon for the past, high
favour for the future."I trust, though, thou dost only mean my kingdom?He is my father's brother--they sat on the knees of the
same father--lay in the bosom of the same mother.Out on thee, man, what
follies they make thy sickbed believe!""It is new to me to be termed
credulous.But the man through whom Albany communicated his temptations
is one whom all will believe so soon as he hints at mischief--even the
medicaments which are prepared by his hands have a relish of poison."such a slave would slander a saint," replied the Prince."Thou
art duped for once, Ramorny, shrewd as thou art.My uncle of Albany
is ambitious, and would secure for himself and for his house a larger
portion of power and wealth than he ought in reason to desire.But to
suppose he would dethrone or slay his brother's son--Fie, Ramorny!put
me not to quote the old saw, that evil doers are evil dreaders.It is
your suspicion, not your knowledge, which speaks."The Duke of
Albany is generally hated for his greed and covetousness.Your Highness
is, it may be, more beloved than--"

Ramorny stopped, the Prince calmly filled up the blank: "More beloved
than I am honoured.It is so I would have it, Ramorny.""At least," said Ramorny, "you are more beloved than you are feared,
and that is no safe condition for a prince.But give me your honour and
knightly word that you will not resent what good service I shall do in
your behalf, and lend me your signet to engage friends in your name,
and the Duke of Albany shall not assume authority in this court till the
wasted hand which once terminated this stump shall be again united to
the body, and acting in obedience to the dictates of my mind.""You would not venture to dip your hands in royal blood?""Fie, my lord, at no rate.Blood need not be shed; life may, nay, will,
be extinguished of itself.For want of trimming it with fresh oil, or
screening it from a breath of wind, the quivering light will die in the
socket.To suffer a man to die is not to kill him."Well, then, suppose my uncle Albany
does not continue to live--I think that must be the phrase--who then
rules the court of Scotland?""Robert the Third, with consent, advice, and authority of the most
mighty David, Duke of Rothsay, Lieutenant of the Kingdom, and alter ego;
in whose favour, indeed, the good King, wearied with the fatigues and
troubles of sovereignty, will, I guess, be well disposed to abdicate.So
long live our brave young monarch, King David the Third!"Ille manu fortis Anglis ludebit in hortis.""And our father and predecessor," said Rothsay, "will he continue to
live to pray for us, as our beadsman, by whose favour he holds the
privilege of laying his grey hairs in the grave as soon, and no earlier,
than the course of nature permits, or must he also encounter some of
those negligences in consequence of which men cease to continue to live,
and can change the limits of a prison, or of a convent resembling one,
for the dark and tranquil cell, where the priests say that the wicked
cease from troubling and the weary are at rest?""You speak in jest, my lord," replied Ramorny: "to harm the good old
King were equally unnatural and impolitic.""Why shrink from that, man, when thy whole scheme," answered the Prince,
in stern displeasure, "is one lesson of unnatural guilt, mixed with
short sighted ambition?If the King of Scotland can scarcely make
head against his nobles, even now when he can hold up before them an
unsullied and honourable banner, who would follow a prince that is
blackened with the death of an uncle and the imprisonment of a father?Why, man, thy policy were enough to revolt a heathen divan, to say
nought of the council of a Christian nation.Thou wert my tutor,
Ramorny, and perhaps I might justly upbraid thy lessons and example for
some of the follies which men chide in me.Perhaps, if it had not been
for thee, I had not been standing at midnight in this fool's guise
(looking at his dress), to hear an ambitious profligate propose to me
the murder of an uncle, the dethronement of the best of fathers.Since
it is my fault as well as thine that has sunk me so deep in the gulf of
infamy, it were unjust that thou alone shouldst die for it.But dare not
to renew this theme to me, on peril of thy life!I will proclaim thee to
my father--to Albany--to Scotland--throughout its length and breadth.As many market crosses as are in the land shall have morsels of
the traitor's carcass, who dare counsel such horrors to the heir of
Scotland.Well hope I, indeed, that the fever of thy wound, and the
intoxicating influence of the cordials which act on thy infirm brain,
have this night operated on thee, rather than any fixed purpose.""In sooth, my lord," said Ramorny, "if I have said any thing which could
so greatly exasperate your Highness, it must have been by excess of
zeal, mingled with imbecility of understanding.Surely I, of all men, am
least likely to propose ambitious projects with a prospect of advantage
to myself!my only future views must be to exchange lance and
saddle for the breviary and the confessional.The convent of Lindores
must receive the maimed and impoverished knight of Ramorny, who will
there have ample leisure to meditate upon the text, 'Put not thy faith
in princes.'""It is a goodly purpose," said the Prince, "and we will not be lacking
to promote it.Our separation, I thought, would have been but for a
time.Certainly, after such talk as we have
held, it were meet that we should live asunder.But the convent of
Lindores, or what ever other house receives thee, shall be richly
endowed and highly favoured by us.And now, Sir John of Ramorny,
sleep--sleep--and forget this evil omened conversation, in which the
fever of disease and of wine has rather, I trust, held colloquy than
your own proper thoughts.A call from Eviot summoned the attendants of the Prince, who had been
sleeping on the staircase and hall, exhausted by the revels of the
evening.said the Duke of Rothsay, disgusted
by the appearance of his attendants."Not a man--not a man," answered the followers, with a drunken shout,
"we are none of us traitors to the Emperor of Merry makers!""And are all of you turned into brutes, then?""In obedience and imitation of your Grace," answered one fellow; "or, if
we are a little behind your Highness, one pull at the pitcher will--"

"Peace, beast!""Are there none of you sober,
I say?""Yes, my noble liege," was the answer; "here is one false brother,
Watkins the Englishman.""Come hither then, Watkins, and aid me with a torch; give me a cloak,
too, and another bonnet, and take away this trumpery," throwing down
his coronet of feathers."I would I could throw off all my follies
as easily.English Wat, attend me alone, and the rest of you end your
revelry, and doff your mumming habits.The holytide is expended, and the
fast has begun.""Our monarch has abdicated sooner than usual this night," said one
of the revel rout; but as the Prince gave no encouragement, such as
happened for the time to want the virtue of sobriety endeavoured to
assume it as well as they could, and the whole of the late rioters began
to adopt the appearance of a set of decent persons, who, having been
surprised into intoxication, endeavoured to disguise their condition by
assuming a double portion of formality of behaviour.In the interim the
Prince, having made a hasty reform in his dress, was lighted to the door
by the only sober man of the company, but, in his progress thither, had
well nigh stumbled over the sleeping bulk of the brute Bonthron.is that vile beast in our way once more?"he said in anger and
disgust."Here, some of you, toss this caitiff into the horse trough;
that for once in his life he may be washed clean."While the train executed his commands, availing themselves of a fountain
which was in the outer court, and while Bonthron underwent a discipline
which he was incapable of resisting, otherwise than by some inarticulate
groans and snorts, like, those of a dying boar, the Prince proceeded on
his way to his apartments, in a mansion called the Constable's lodgings,
from the house being the property of the Earls of Errol.On the way, to
divert his thoughts from the more unpleasing matters, the Prince asked
his companion how he came to be sober, when the rest of the party had
been so much overcome with liquor."So please your honour's Grace," replied English Wat, "I confess it was
very familiar in me to be sober when it was your Grace's pleasure that
your train should be mad drunk; but in respect they were all Scottishmen
but myself, I thought it argued no policy in getting drunken in their
company, seeing that they only endure me even when we are all sober, and
if the wine were uppermost, I might tell them a piece of my mind, and be
paid with as many stabs as there are skenes in the good company.""So it is your purpose never to join any of the revels of our
household?""Under favour, yes; unless it be your Grace's pleasure that the residue
of your train should remain one day sober, to admit Will Watkins to get
drunk without terror of his life.""Let our chamberlain bring thee into the household, as a yeoman of the
night watch.I like thy favour, and it is something to have one sober
fellow in the house, although he is only such through the fear of death.Attend, therefore, near our person; and thou shalt find sobriety a
thriving virtue."Meantime a load of care and fear added to the distress of Sir John
Ramorny's sick chamber.His reflections, disordered as they were by the
opiate, fell into great confusion when the Prince, in whose presence he
had suppressed its effect by strong resistance, had left the apartment.His consciousness, which he had possessed perfectly during the
interview, began to be very much disturbed.He felt a general sense
that he had incurred a great danger, that he had rendered the Prince his
enemy, and that he had betrayed to him a secret which might affect his
own life.In this state of mind and body, it was not strange that he
should either dream, or else that his diseased organs should become
subject to that species of phantasmagoria which is excited by the use
of opium.He thought that the shade of Queen Annabella stood by his
bedside, and demanded the youth whom she had placed under his charge,
simple, virtuous, gay, and innocent."Thou hast rendered him reckless, dissolute, and vicious," said the
shade of pallid Majesty."Yet I thank thee, John of Ramorny, ungrateful
to me, false to thy word, and treacherous to my hopes.Thy hate shall
counteract the evil which thy friendship has done to him.And well do
I hope that, now thou art no longer his counsellor, a bitter penance on
earth may purchase my ill fated child pardon and acceptance in a better
world."Ramorny stretched out his arms after his benefactress, and endeavoured
to express contrition and excuse; but the countenance of the apparition
became darker and sterner, till it was no longer that of the late Queen,
but presented the gloomy and haughty aspect of the Black Douglas; then
the timid and sorrowful face of King Robert, who seemed to mourn over
the approaching dissolution of his royal house; and then a group of
fantastic features, partly hideous, partly ludicrous, which moped, and
chattered, and twisted themselves into unnatural and extravagant
forms, as if ridiculing his endeavour to obtain an exact idea of their
lineaments.A purple land, where law secures not life.The morning of Ash Wednesday arose pale and bleak, as usual at this
season in Scotland, where the worst and most inclement weather often
occurs in the early spring months.It was a severe day of frost, and the
citizens had to sleep away the consequences of the preceding holiday's
debauchery.The sun had therefore risen for an hour above the horizon
before there was any general appearance of life among the inhabitants
of Perth, so that it was some time after daybreak when a citizen, going
early to mass, saw the body of the luckless Oliver Proudfute lying on
its face across the kennel in the manner in which he had fallen under
the blow; as our readers will easily imagine, of Anthony Bonthron, the
"boy of the belt"--that is the executioner of the pleasure--of John of
Ramorny.This early citizen was Allan Griffin, so termed because he was master
of the Griffin Inn; and the alarm which he raised soon brought together
first straggling neighbours, and by and by a concourse of citizens.At
first from the circumstance of the well known buff coat and the crimson
feather in the head piece, the noise arose that it was the stout smith
that lay there slain.This false rumour continued for some time, for the
host of the Griffin, who himself had been a magistrate, would not permit
the body to be touched or stirred till Bailie Craigdallie arrived, so
that the face was not seen..

"This concerns the Fair City, my friends," he said, "and if it is the
stout Smith of the Wynd who lies here, the man lives not in Perth who
will not risk land and life to avenge him.Look you, the villains have
struck him down behind his back, for there is not a man within ten
Scotch miles of Perth, gentle or simple, Highland or Lowland, that
would have met him face to face with such evil purpose.the flower of your manhood has been cut down, and that by a base
and treacherous hand."A wild cry of fury arose from the people, who were fast assembling."We will take him on our shoulders," said a strong butcher, "we will
carry him to the King's presence at the Dominican convent"

"Ay--ay," answered a blacksmith, "neither bolt nor bar shall keep us
from the King, neither monk nor mass shall break our purpose.A better
armourer never laid hammer on anvil!""To the Dominicans--to the Dominicans!""Bethink you, burghers," said another citizen, "our king is a good king
and loves us like his children.It is the Douglas and the Duke of Albany
that will not let good King Robert hear the distresses of his people.""Are we to be slain in our own streets for the King's softness of
heart?"If the King will not
keep us, we will keep ourselves.Ring the bells backward, every bell of
them that is made of metal."Ay," cried another citizen, "and let us to the holds of Albany and the
Douglas, and burn them to the ground.Let the fires tell far and near
that Perth knew how to avenge her stout Henry Gow.He has fought a score
of times for the Fair City's right; let us show we can once to avenge
his wrong.This cry, the well known rallying word amongst the inhabitants of Perth,
and seldom heard but on occasions of general uproar, was echoed from
voice to voice; and one or two neighbouring steeples, of which the
enraged citizens possessed themselves, either by consent of the priests
or in spite of their opposition, began to ring out the ominous alarm
notes, in which, as the ordinary succession of the chimes was reversed,
the bells were said to be rung backward.Still, as the crowd thickened, and the roar waxed more universal and
louder, Allan Griffin, a burly man with a deep voice, and well respected
among high and low, kept his station as he bestrode the corpse, and
called loudly to the multitude to keep back and wait the arrival of the
magistrates."We must proceed by order in this matter, my masters, we must have our
magistrates at our head.They are duly chosen and elected in our town
hall, good men and true every one; we will not be called rioters, or
idle perturbators of the king's peace.Stand you still, and make room,
for yonder comes Bailie Craigdallie, ay, and honest Simon Glover, to
whom the Fair City is so much bounden.my kind townsmen, his
beautiful daughter was a bride yesternight; this morning the Fair Maid
of Perth is a widow before she has been a wife."This new theme of sympathy increased the rage and sorrow of the crowd
the more, as many women now mingled with them, who echoed back the alarm
cry to the men.For the Fair Maid of Perth and
the brave Henry Gow!Up--up, every one of you, spare not for your skin
cutting!To the stables!--to the stables!When the horse is gone the man
at arms is useless--cut off the grooms and yeomen; lame, maim, and stab
the horses; kill the base squires and pages.Let these proud knights
meet us on their feet if they dare!""They dare not--they dare not," answered the men; "their strength is
their horses and armour; and yet the haughty and ungrateful villains
have slain a man whose skill as an armourer was never matched in Milan
or Venice.To arms!--to arms, brave burghers!Amid this clamour, the magistrates and superior class of inhabitants
with difficulty obtained room to examine the body, having with them the
town clerk to take an official protocol, or, as it is still called, a
precognition, of the condition in which it was found.To these delays
the multitude submitted, with a patience and order which strongly marked
the national character of a people whose resentment has always been
the more deeply dangerous, that they will, without relaxing their
determination of vengeance, submit with patience to all delays which are
necessary to ensure its attainment.The multitude, therefore, received
their magistrates with a loud cry, in which the thirst of revenge was
announced, together with the deferential welcome to the patrons by whose
direction they expected to obtain it in right and legal fashion.While these accents of welcome still rung above the crowd, who now
filled the whole adjacent streets, receiving and circulating a thousand
varying reports, the fathers of the city caused the body to be raised
and more closely examined; when it was instantly perceived, and the
truth publicly announced, that not the armourer of the Wynd, so highly
and, according to the esteemed qualities of the time, so justly popular
among his fellow citizens, but a man of far less general estimation,
though not without his own value in society, lay murdered before
them--the brisk bonnet maker, Oliver Proudfute.The resentment of the
people had so much turned upon the general opinion that their frank
and brave champion, Henry Gow, was the slaughtered person, that the
contradiction of the report served to cool the general fury, although,
if poor Oliver had been recognised at first, there is little doubt that
the cry of vengeance would have been as unanimous, though not probably
so furious, as in the case of Henry Wynd.The first circulation of the
unexpected intelligence even excited a smile among the crowd, so near
are the confines of the ludicrous to those of the terrible."The murderers have without doubt taken him for Henry Smith,"
said Griffin, "which must have been a great comfort to him in the
circumstances."But the arrival of other persons on the scene soon restored its deeply
tragic character.The wild rumours which flew through the town, speedily followed by the
tolling of the alarm bells spread general consternation.The nobles
and knights, with their followers, gathered in different places of
rendezvous, where a defence could best be maintained; and the alarm
reached the royal residence where the young prince was one of the first
to appear, to assist, if necessary, in the defence of the old king.The
scene of the preceding night ran in his recollection; and, remembering
the bloodstained figure of Bonthron, he conceived, though indistinctly,
that the ruffian's action had been connected with this uproar.The
subsequent and more interesting discourse with Sir John Ramorny had,
however, been of such an impressive nature as to obliterate all
traces of what he had vaguely heard of the bloody act of the assassin,
excepting a confused recollection that some one or other had been slain.It was chiefly on his father's account that he had assumed arms with his
household train, who, clad in bright armour, and bearing lances in
their hands, made now a figure very different from that of the preceding
night, when they appeared as intoxicated Bacchanalians.The kind old
monarch received this mark of filial attachment with tears of gratitude,
and proudly presented his son to his brother Albany, who entered shortly
afterwards."Now are we three Stuarts," he said, "as inseparable as the holy
trefoil; and, as they say the wearer of that sacred herb mocks at
magical delusion, so we, while we are true to each other, may set malice
and enmity at defiance."The brother and son kissed the kind hand which pressed theirs, while
Robert III expressed his confidence in their affection.The kiss of the
youth was, for the time, sincere; that of the brother was the salute of
the apostate Judas.John's church alarmed, amongst others,
the inhabitants of Curfew Street.In the house of Simon Glover, old
Dorothy Glover, as she was called (for she also took name from the trade
she practised, under her master's auspices), was the first to catch the
sound.Though somewhat deaf upon ordinary occasions, her ear for bad
news was as sharp as a kite's scent for carrion; for Dorothy, otherwise
an industrious, faithful, and even affectionate creature, had that
strong appetite for collecting and retailing sinister intelligence which
is often to be marked in the lower classes.Little accustomed to be
listened to, they love the attention which a tragic tale ensures to the
bearer, and enjoy, perhaps, the temporary equality to which misfortune
reduces those who are ordinarily accounted their superiors.Dorothy had
no sooner possessed herself of a slight packet of the rumours which were
flying abroad than she bounced into her master's bedroom, who had taken
the privilege of age and the holytide to sleep longer than usual."There he lies, honest man," said Dorothy, half in a screeching and half
in a wailing tone of sympathy--"there he lies; his best friend slain,
and he knowing as little about it as the babe new born, that kens not
life from death."said the glover, starting up out of his bed."What is the
matter, old woman?said Dorothy, who, having her fish hooked, chose to let him
play a little."I am not so old," said she, flouncing out of the room,
"as to bide in the place till a man rises from his naked bed--"

And presently she was heard at a distance in the parlour beneath,
melodiously singing to the scrubbing of her own broom."Dorothy--screech owl--devil--say but my daughter is well!""I am well, my father," answered the Fair Maid of Perth, speaking from
her bedroom, "perfectly well, but what, for Our Lady's sake, is the
matter?The bells ring backward, and there is shrieking and crying in
the streets."Here, Conachar, come speedily and
tie my points.I forgot--the Highland loon is far beyond Fortingall.Patience, daughter, I will presently bring you news.""Ye need not hurry yourself for that, Simon Glover," quoth the obdurate
old woman; "the best and the worst of it may be tauld before you could
hobble over your door stane.I ken the haill story abroad; 'for,'
thought I, 'our goodman is so wilful that he'll be for banging out to
the tuilzie, be the cause what it like; and sae I maun e'en stir my
shanks, and learn the cause of all this, or he will hae his auld nose in
the midst of it, and maybe get it nipt off before he knows what for.'""And what is the news, then, old woman?"said the impatient glover,
still busying himself with the hundred points or latchets which were the
means of attaching the doublet to the hose.Dorothy suffered him to proceed in his task till she conjectured it must
be nearly accomplished; and foresaw that; if she told not the secret
herself, her master would be abroad to seek in person for the cause of
the disturbance.She, therefore, halloo'd out: "Aweel--aweel, ye canna
say it is me fault, if you hear ill news before you have been at
the morning mass.I would have kept it from ye till ye had heard the
priest's word; but since you must hear it, you have e'en lost the truest
friend that ever gave hand to another, and Perth maun mourn for the
bravest burgher that ever took a blade in hand!"exclaimed the father and the daughter at
once."Oh, ay, there ye hae it at last," said Dorothy; "and whose fault was it
but your ain?ye made such a piece of work about his companying with a
glee woman, as if he had companied with a Jewess!"Dorothy would have gone on long enough, but her master exclaimed to
his daughter, who was still in her own apartment: "It is nonsense,
Catharine--all the dotage of an old fool.I will bring you the true tidings in a moment," and snatching up his
staff, the old man hurried out past Dorothy and into the street, where
the throng of people were rushing towards the High Street.Dorothy, in the mean time, kept muttering to herself: "Thy father is a
wise man, take his ain word for it.He will come next by some scathe
in the hobbleshow, and then it will be, 'Dorothy, get the lint,' and
'Dorothy, spread the plaster;' but now it is nothing but nonsense, and
a lie, and impossibility, that can come out of Dorothy's mouth.Does auld Simon think that Harry Smith's head was as hard as
his stithy, and a haill clan of Highlandmen dinging at him?"Here she was interrupted by a figure like an angel, who came wandering
by her with wild eye, cheek deadly pale, hair dishevelled, and an
apparent want of consciousness, which terrified the old woman out of her
discontented humour."Did you not say some one was dead?"said Catharine, with a frightful
uncertainty of utterance, as if her organs of speech and hearing served
her but imperfectly.Ay--ay, dead eneugh; ye'll no hae him to gloom at ony
mair."repeated Catharine, still with the same uncertainty of voice and
manner."Dead--slain--and by Highlanders?""I'se warrant by Highlanders, the lawless loons.Wha is it else that
kills maist of the folks about, unless now and than when the burghers
take a tirrivie, and kill ane another, or whiles that the knights and
nobles shed blood?But I'se uphauld it's been the Highlandmen this bout.The man was no in Perth, laird or loon, durst have faced Henry Smith
man to man.There's been sair odds against him; ye'll see that when it's
looked into."repeated Catharine, as if haunted by some idea which
troubled her senses.Oh, Conachar--Conachar!""Indeed, and I dare say you have lighted on the very man, Catharine.They quarrelled, as you saw, on the St.Valentine's Even, and had a
warstle.A Highlandman has a long memory for the like of that.Gie him
a cuff at Martinmas, and his cheek will be tingling at Whitsunday.But
what could have brought down the lang legged loons to do their bloody
wark within burgh?""Woe's me, it was I," said Catharine--"it was I brought the Highlanders
down--I that sent for Conachar--ay, they have lain in wait--but it was I
that brought them within reach of their prey.But I will see with my own
eyes--and then--something we will do.Say to my father I will be back
anon."shouted Dorothy, as Catharine made past her
towards the street door."You would not gang into the street with the
hair hanging down your haffets in that guise, and you kenn'd for the
Fair Maid of Perth?Mass, but she's out in the street, come o't what
like, and the auld Glover will be as mad as if I could withhold her,
will she nill she, flyte she fling she.This is a brave morning for an
Ash Wednesday!If I were to seek my master among the
multitude, I were like to be crushed beneath their feet, and little moan
made for the old woman.And am I to run after Catharine, who ere this is
out of sight, and far lighter of foot than I am?so I will just down the
gate to Nicol Barber's, and tell him a' about it."While the trusty Dorothy was putting her prudent resolve into execution,
Catharine ran through the streets of Perth in a manner which at another
moment would have brought on her the attention of every one who saw her
hurrying on with a reckless impetuosity wildly and widely different from
the ordinary decency and composure of her step and manner, and without
the plaid, scarf, or mantle which "women of good," of fair character
and decent rank, universally carried around them, when they went abroad.But, distracted as the people were, every one inquiring or telling
the cause of the tumult, and most recounting it different ways,
the negligence of her dress and discomposure of her manner made no
impression on any one; and she was suffered to press forward on the path
she had chosen without attracting more notice than the other females
who, stirred by anxious curiosity or fear, had come out to inquire the
cause of an alarm so general--it might be to seek for friends for whose
safety they were interested.As Catharine passed along, she felt all the wild influence of the
agitating scene, and it was with difficulty she forbore from repeating
the cries of lamentation and alarm which were echoed around her.In the
mean time, she rushed rapidly on, embarrassed like one in a dream, with
a strange sense of dreadful calamity, the precise nature of which she
was unable to define, but which implied the terrible consciousness that
the man who loved her so fondly, whose good qualities she so highly
esteemed, and whom she now felt to be dearer than perhaps she would
before have acknowledged to her own bosom, was murdered, and most
probably by her means.The connexion betwixt Henry's supposed death and
the descent of Conachar and his followers, though adopted by her in a
moment of extreme and engrossing emotion, was sufficiently probable
to have been received for truth, even if her understanding had been
at leisure to examine its credibility.Without knowing what she sought
except the general desire to know the worst of the dreadful report, she
hurried forward to the very spot which of all others her feelings of the
preceding day would have induced her to avoid.Who would, upon the evening of Shrovetide, have persuaded the proud, the
timid, the shy, the rigidly decorous Catharine Glover that before mass
on Ash Wednesday she should rush through the streets of Perth, making
her way amidst tumult and confusion, with her hair unbound and her dress
disarranged, to seek the house of that same lover who, she had reason to
believe, had so grossly and indelicately neglected and affronted her as
to pursue a low and licentious amour?Yet so it was; and her eagerness
taking, as if by instinct, the road which was most free, she avoided the
High Street, where the pressure was greatest, and reached the wynd by
the narrow lanes on the northern skirt of the town, through which Henry
Smith had formerly escorted Louise.But even these comparatively lonely
passages were now astir with passengers, so general was the alarm.Catharine Glover made her way through them, however, while such as
observed her looked on each other and shook their heads in sympathy with
her distress.At length, without any distinct idea of her own purpose,
she stood before her lover's door and knocked for admittance.The silence which succeeded the echoing of her hasty summons increased
the alarm which had induced her to take this desperate measure.Open, if you
would not find Catharine Glover dead upon your threshold!"As she cried thus frantically to ears which she was taught to believe
were stopped by death, the lover she invoked opened the door in person,
just in time to prevent her sinking on the ground.The extremity of his
ecstatic joy upon an occasion so unexpected was qualified only by the
wonder which forbade him to believe it real, and by his alarm at the
closed eyes, half opened and blanched lips, total absence of complexion,
and apparently total cessation of breathing.Henry had remained at home, in spite of the general alarm, which had
reached his ears for a considerable time, fully determined to put
himself in the way of no brawls that he could avoid; and it was only in
compliance with a summons from the magistrates, which, as a burgher, he
was bound to obey, that, taking his sword and a spare buckler from the
wall, he was about to go forth, for the first time unwillingly, to pay
his service, as his tenure bound him."It is hard," he said, "to be put forward in all the town feuds, when
the fighting work is so detestable to Catharine.I am sure there are
enough of wenches in Perth that say to their gallants, 'Go out, do your
devoir bravely, and win your lady's grace'; and yet they send not for
their lovers, but for me, who cannot do the duties of a man to protect
a minstrel woman, or of a burgess who fights for the honour of his
town, but this peevish Catharine uses me as if I were a brawler and
bordeller!"Such were the thoughts which occupied his mind, when, as he opened his
door to issue forth, the person dearest to his thoughts, but whom he
certainly least expected to see, was present to his eyes, and dropped
into his arms.His mixture of surprise, joy, and anxiety did not deprive him of the
presence of mind which the occasion demanded.To place Catharine
Glover in safety, and recall her to herself was to be thought of
before rendering obedience to the summons of the magistrates, however
pressingly that had been delivered.He carried his lovely burden, as
light as a feather, yet more precious than the same quantity of purest
gold, into a small bedchamber which had been his mother's.It was the
most fit for an invalid, as it looked into the garden, and was separated
from the noise of the tumult."Here, Nurse--Nurse Shoolbred--come quick--come for death and life--here
is one wants thy help!""If it should but prove any one that will keep
thee out of the scuffle," for she also had been aroused by the noise;
but what was her astonishment when, placed in love and reverence on
the bed of her late mistress, and supported by the athletic arms of her
foster son, she saw the apparently lifeless form of the Fair Maid of
Perth.she said; "and, Holy Mother, a dying woman, as it
would seem!""Not so, old woman," said her foster son: "the dear heart throbs--the
sweet breath comes and returns!Come thou, that may aid her more meetly
than I--bring water--essences--whatever thy old skill can devise.Heaven
did not place her in my arms to die, but to live for herself and me!"With an activity which her age little promised, Nurse Shoolbred
collected the means of restoring animation; for, like many women of the
period, she understood what was to be done in such cases, nay, possessed
a knowledge of treating wounds of an ordinary description, which the
warlike propensities of her foster son kept in pretty constant exercise."Come now," she said, "son Henry, unfold your arms from about my
patient, though she is worth the pressing, and set thy hands at freedom
to help me with what I want.Nay, I will not insist on your quitting
her hand, if you will beat the palm gently, as the fingers unclose their
clenched grasp."said Henry; "you were as well bid
me beat a glass cup with a forehammer as tap her fair palm with my horn
hard fingers.But the fingers do unfold, and we will find a better way
than beating"; and he applied his lips to the pretty hand, whose motion
indicated returning sensation.One or two deep sighs succeeded, and
the Fair Maid of Perth opened her eyes, fixed them on her lover, as
he kneeled by the bedside, and again sunk back on the pillow.As she
withdrew not her hand from her lover's hold or from his grasp, we must
in charity believe that the return to consciousness was not so complete
as to make her aware that he abused the advantage, by pressing it
alternately to his lips and his bosom.At the same time we are compelled
to own that the blood was colouring in her cheek, and that her breathing
was deep and regular, for a minute or two during this relapse.The noise at the door began now to grow much louder, and Henry was
called for by all his various names of Smith.Gow, and Hal of the Wynd,
as heathens used to summon their deities by different epithets.At last,
like Portuguese Catholics when exhausted with entreating their saints,
the crowd without had recourse to vituperative exclamations.You are a disgraced man, man sworn to your burgher
oath, and a traitor to the Fair City, unless you come instantly forth!"It would seem that nurse Shoolbred's applications were now so far
successful that Catharine's senses were in some measure restored; for,
turning her face more towards that of her lover than her former posture
permitted, she let her right hand fall on his shoulder, leaving her left
still in his possession, and seeming slightly to detain him, while she
whispered: "Do not go, Henry--stay with me; they will kill thee, these
men of blood."It would seem that this gentle invocation, the result of finding the
lover alive whom she expected to have only recognised as a corpse,
though it was spoken so low as scarcely to be intelligible, had more
effect to keep Henry Wynd in his present posture than the repeated
summons of many voices from without had to bring him downstairs."Mass, townsmen," cried one hardy citizen to his companions, "the saucy
smith but jests with us!Let us into the house, and bring him out by the
lug and the horn.""Take care what you are doing," said a more cautious assailant."The man
that presses on Henry Gow's retirement may go into his house with sound
bones, but will return with ready made work for the surgeon.But here
comes one has good right to do our errand to him, and make the recreant
hear reason on both sides of his head."The person of whom this was spoken was no other than Simon Glover
himself.He had arrived at the fatal spot where the unlucky bonnet
maker's body was lying, just in time to discover, to his great relief,
that when it was turned with the face upwards by Bailie Craigdallie's
orders, the features of the poor braggart Proudfute were recognised,
when the crowd expected to behold those of their favorite champion,
Henry Smith.A laugh, or something approaching to one, went among those
who remembered how hard Oliver had struggled to obtain the character
of a fighting man, however foreign to his nature and disposition, and
remarked now that he had met with a mode of death much better suited
to his pretensions than to his temper.But this tendency to ill timed
mirth, which savoured of the rudeness of the times, was at once hushed
by the voice, and cries, and exclamations of a woman who struggled
through the crowd, screaming at the same time, "Oh, my husband--my
husband!"Room was made for the sorrower, who was followed by two or three female
friends.Maudie Proudfute had been hitherto only noticed as a good
looking, black haired woman, believed to be "dink" and disdainful to
those whom she thought meaner or poorer than herself, and lady and
empress over her late husband, whom she quickly caused to lower his
crest when she chanced to hear him crowing out of season.But now,
under the influence of powerful passion, she assumed a far more imposing
character."Do you laugh," she said, "you unworthy burghers of Perth, because one
of your own citizens has poured his blood into the kennel?or do you
laugh because the deadly lot has lighted on my husband?Did he not maintain an honest house by his own industry,
and keep a creditable board, where the sick had welcome and the poor had
relief?Did he not lend to those who wanted, stand by his neighbours as
a friend, keep counsel and do justice like a magistrate?""It is true--it is true," answered the assembly; "his blood is our blood
as much as if it were Henry Gow's.""You speak truth, neighbours," said Bailie Craigdallie; "and this feud
cannot be patched up as the former was: citizen's blood must not flow
unavenged down our kennels, as if it were ditch water, or we shall soon
see the broad Tay crimsoned with it.But this blow was never meant for
the poor man on whom it has unhappily fallen.Every one knew what Oliver
Proudfute was, how wide he would speak, and how little he would do.He
has Henry Smith's buff coat, target, and head piece.All the town know
them as well as I do: there is no doubt on't.He had the trick, as you
know, of trying to imitate the smith in most things.Some one, blind
with rage, or perhaps through liquor, has stricken the innocent bonnet
maker, whom no man either hated or feared, or indeed cared either much
or little about, instead of the stout smith, who has twenty feuds upon
his hands.""What then, is to be done, bailie?""That, my friends, your magistrates will determine for you, as we shall
instantly meet together when Sir Patrick Charteris cometh here, which
must be anon.Meanwhile, let the chirurgeon Dwining examine that poor
piece of clay, that he may tell us how he came by his fatal death; and
then let the corpse be decently swathed in a clean shroud, as becomes
an honest citizen, and placed before the high altar in the church of
St.Cease all clamour and noise, and
every defensible man of you, as you would wish well to the Fair Town,
keep his weapons in readiness, and be prepared to assemble on the High
Street at the tolling of the common bell from the townhouse, and we will
either revenge the death of our fellow citizen, or else we shall take
such fortune as Heaven will send us.Meanwhile avoid all quarrelling
With the knights and their followers till we know the innocent from the
guilty.But wherefore tarries this knave Smith?He is ready enough
in tumults when his presence is not wanted, and lags he now when his
presence may serve the Fair City?What ails him, doth any one know?Hath
he been upon the frolic last Fastern's Even?""Rather he is sick or sullen, Master Bailie," said one of the city's
mairs, or sergeants; "for though he is within door, as his knaves
report, yet he will neither answer to us nor admit us.""So please your worship, Master Bailie," said Simon Glover, "I will go
myself to fetch Henry Smith.I have some little difference to make up
with him.And blessed be Our Lady, who hath so ordered it that I find
him alive, as a quarter of an hour since I could never have expected!""Bring the stout smith to the council house," said the bailie, as a
mounted yeoman pressed through the crowd and whispered in his ear, "Here
is a good fellow who says the Knight of Kinfauns is entering the port."Such was the occasion of Simon Glover presenting himself at the house of
Henry Gow at the period already noticed.Unrestrained by the considerations of doubt and hesitation which
influenced others, he repaired to the parlour; and having overheard the
bustling of Dame Shoolbred, he took the privilege of intimacy to ascend
to the bedroom, and, with the slight apology of "I crave your pardon,
good neighbour," he opened the door and entered the apartment, where a
singular and unexpected sight awaited him.At the sound of his voice,
May Catharine experienced a revival much speedier than Dame Shoolbred's
restoratives had been able to produce, and the paleness of her
complexion changed into a deep glow of the most lovely red.She pushed
her lover from her with both her hands, which, until this minute, her
want of consciousness, or her affection, awakened by the events of the
morning, had well nigh abandoned to his caresses.Henry Smith, bashful
as we know him, stumbled as he rose up; and none of the party were
without a share of confusion, excepting Dame Shoolbred, who was glad
to make some pretext to turn her back to the others, in order that she
might enjoy a laugh at their expense, which she felt herself utterly
unable to restrain, and in which the glover, whose surprise, though
great, was of short duration, and of a joyful character, sincerely
joined.John," he said, "I thought I had seen a sight this
morning that would cure me of laughter, at least till Lent was over;
but this would make me curl my cheek if I were dying.Why, here stands
honest Henry Smith, who was lamented as dead, and toll'd out for from
every steeple in town, alive, merry, and, as it seems from his ruddy
complexion, as like to live as any man in Perth.And here is my precious
daughter, that yesterday would speak of nothing but the wickedness of
the wights that haunt profane sports and protect glee maidens.Cupid both at defiance--here she is,
turned a glee maiden herself, for what I can see!Truly, I am glad to
see that you, my good Dame Shoolbred, who give way to no disorder, have
been of this loving party.""You do me wrong, my dearest father," said Catharine, as if about to
weep."I came here with far different expectations than you suppose.I
only came because--because--"

"Because you expected to find a dead lover," said her father, "and you
have found a living one, who can receive the tokens of your regard, and
return them.Now, were it not a sin, I could find in my heart to thank
Heaven that thou hast been surprised at last into owning thyself a
woman.Simon Glover is not worthy to have an absolute saint for his
daughter.Nay, look not so piteously, nor expect condolence from me!Only I will try not to look merry, if you will be pleased to stop your
tears, or confess them to be tears of joy.""If I were to die for such a confession," said poor Catharine, "I could
not tell what to call them.Only believe, dear father, and let Henry
believe, that I would never have come hither; unless--unless--"

"Unless you had thought that Henry could not come to you," said her
father."And now, shake hands in peace and concord, and agree as
Valentines should.Yesterday was Shrovetide, Henry; We will hold that
thou hast confessed thy follies, hast obtained absolution, and art
relieved of all the guilt thou stoodest charged with.""Nay touching that, father Simon," said the smith, "now that you are
cool enough to hear me, I can swear on the Gospels, and I can call my
nurse, Dame Shoolbred, to witness--"

"Nay--nay," said the glover, "but wherefore rake up differences which
should all be forgotten?""Hark ye, Simon!--Simon Glover!""True, son Smith," said the glover, seriously, "we have other work in
hand.Catharine shall remain
here with Dame Shoolbred, who will take charge of her till we return;
and then, as the town is in misrule, we two, Harry, will carry her home,
and they will be bold men that cross us.""Nay, my dear father," said Catharine, with a smile, "now you are taking
Oliver Proudfute's office.That doughty burgher is Henry's brother at
arms.""You have spoke a stinging word, daughter; but you know not what has
happened.Kiss him, Catharine, in token of forgiveness.""Not so," said Catharine; "I have done him too much grace already.When
he has seen the errant damsel safe home, it will be time enough to claim
his reward.""Meantime," said Henry, "I will claim, as your host, what you will not
allow me on other terms."He folded the fair maiden in his arms, and was permitted to take the
salute which she had refused to bestow.As they descended the stair together, the old man laid his hand on the
smith's shoulder, and said: "Henry, my dearest wishes are fulfilled;
but it is the pleasure of the saints that it should be in an hour of
difficulty and terror.""True," said the smith; "but thou knowest, father, if our riots be
frequent at Perth, at least they seldom last long."Then, opening a door which led from the house into the smithy, "here,
comrades," he cried, "Anton, Cuthbert, Dingwell, and Ringen!Let none of
you stir from the place till I return.Be as true as the weapons I have
taught you to forge: a French crown and a Scotch merrymaking for you, if
you obey my command.Watch
the doors well, let little Jannekin scout up and down the wynd, and have
your arms ready if any one approaches the house.Open the doors to no
man till father Glover or I return: it concerns my life and happiness."The strong, swarthy giants to whom he spoke answered: "Death to him who
attempts it!""My Catharine is now as safe," said he to her father, "as if twenty men
garrisoned a royal castle in her cause.We shall pass most quietly to
the council house by walking through the garden."He led the way through a little orchard accordingly, where the birds,
which had been sheltered and fed during the winter by the good natured
artisan, early in the season as it was, were saluting the precarious
smiles of a February sun with a few faint and interrupted attempts at
melody."Hear these minstrels, father," said the smith; "I laughed at them this
morning in the bitterness of my heart, because the little wretches sung,
with so much of winter before them.But now, methinks, I could bear a
blythe chorus, for I have my Valentine as they have theirs; and whatever
ill may lie before me for tomorrow, I am today the happiest man in
Perth, city or county, burgh or landward.""Yet I must allay your joy," said the old glover, "though, Heaven knows,
I share it.Poor Oliver Proudfute, the inoffensive fool that you and I
knew so well, has been found this morning dead in the streets."said the smith; "nay, a candle and a dose of
matrimonial advice will bring him to life again."He is slain--slain with a battle axe or some such
weapon."replied the smith; "he was light footed enough, and would
not for all Perth have trusted to his hands, when he could extricate
himself by his heels."The blow was dealt in the very back of his
head; he who struck must have been a shorter man than himself, and used
a horseman's battle axe, or some such weapon, for a Lochaber axe must
have struck the upper part of his head.But there he lies dead, brained,
I may say, by a most frightful wound.""This is inconceivable," said Henry Wynd."He was in my house at
midnight, in a morricer's habit; seemed to have been drinking, though
not to excess.He told me a tale of having been beset by revellers,
and being in danger; but, alas!you know the man--I deemed it was a
swaggering fit, as he sometimes took when he was in liquor; and, may the
Merciful Virgin forgive me!I let him go without company, in which I did
him inhuman wrong.I would have gone with
any helpless creature; and far more with him, with whom I have so often
sat at the same board and drunken of the same cup.Who, of the race
of man, could have thought of harming a creature so simple and so
unoffending, excepting by his idle vaunts?""Henry, he wore thy head piece, thy buff coat; thy target."Why, he demanded the use of them for the night, and I was ill at ease,
and well pleased to be rid of his company, having kept no holiday, and
being determined to keep none, in respect of our misunderstanding.""It is the opinion of Bailie Craigdallie and all our sagest counsellors
that the blow was intended for yourself, and that it becomes you to
prosecute the due vengeance of our fellow citizen, who received the
death which was meant for you."They had now left the garden, and
were walking in a lonely lane, by which they meant to approach the
council house of the burgh without being exposed to observation or idle
inquiry."You are silent, my son, yet we two have much to speak of," said Simon
Glover."Bethink thee that this widowed woman, Maudlin, if she should
see cause to bring a charge against any one for the wrong done to her
and her orphan children, must support it by a champion, according to
law and custom; for, be the murderer who he may, we know enough of these
followers of the nobles to be assured that the party suspected will
appeal to the combat, in derision, perhaps, of we whom they will call
the cowardly burghers.While we are men with blood in our veins, this
must not be, Henry Wynd.""I see where you would draw me, father," answered Henry, dejectedly,
"and St.John knows I have heard a summons to battle as willingly as war
horse ever heard the trumpet.But bethink you, father, how I have lost
Catharine's favour repeatedly, and have been driven well nigh to despair
of ever regaining it, for being, if I may say so, even too ready a man
of my hands.And here are all our quarrels made up, and the hopes that
seemed this morning removed beyond earthly prospect have become
nearer and brighter than ever; and must I with the dear one's kiss of
forgiveness on my lips, engage in a new scene of violence, which you are
well aware will give her the deepest offence?""It is hard for me to advise you, Henry," said Simon; "but this I must
ask you: Have you, or have you not, reason to think that this poor
unfortunate Oliver has been mistaken for you?""I fear it too much," said Henry."He was thought something like me, and
the poor fool had studied to ape my gestures and manner of walking,
nay the very airs which I have the trick of whistling, that he might
increase a resemblance which has cost him dear.I have ill willers
enough, both in burgh and landward, to owe me a shrewd turn; and he, I
think, could have none such.""Well, Henry, I cannot say but my daughter will be offended.She has
been much with Father Clement, and has received notions about peace and
forgiveness which methinks suit ill with a country where the laws cannot
protect us, unless we have spirit to protect ourselves.If you determine
for the combat, I will do my best to persuade her to look on the matter
as the other good womanhood in the burgh will do; and if you resolve to
let the matter rest--the man who has lost his life for yours remaining
unavenged, the widow and the orphans without any reparation for the loss
of a husband and father--I will then do you the justice to think that I,
at least, ought not to think the worse of you for your patience, since
it was adopted for love of my child.But, Henry, we must in that case
remove ourselves from bonny St.Johnston, for here we will be but a
disgraced family."Henry groaned deeply, and was silent for an instant, then replied: "I
would rather be dead than dishonoured, though I should never see her
again!Had it been yester evening, I would have met the best blade among
these men at arms as blythely as ever I danced at a maypole.But today,
when she had first as good as said, 'Henry Smith, I love thee!'Father
Glover; it is very hard.I ought to have allowed him the shelter of my roof, when he
prayed me in his agony of fear; or; had I gone with him, I should then
have prevented or shared his fate.But I taunted him, ridiculed him,
loaded him with maledictions, though the saints know they were uttered
in idle peevishness of impatience.I drove him out from my doors, whom I
knew so helpless, to take the fate which was perhaps intended for me.I must avenge him, or be dishonoured for ever.See, father, I have been
called a man hard as the steel I work in.Does burnished steel ever drop
tears like these?Shame on me that I should shed them!""It is no shame, my dearest son," said Simon; "thou art as kind as
brave, and I have always known it.No one
may be discovered to whom suspicion attaches, and where none such is
found, the combat cannot take place.It is a hard thing to wish that the
innocent blood may not be avenged.But if the perpetrator of this foul
murder be hidden for the present, thou wilt be saved from the task
of seeking that vengeance which Heaven doubtless will take at its own
proper time."As they spoke thus, they arrived at the point of the High Street where
the council house was situated.As they reached the door, and made
their way through the multitude who thronged the street, they found the
avenues guarded by a select party of armed burghers, and about fifty
spears belonging to the Knight of Kinfauns, who, with his allies
the Grays, Blairs, Moncrieffs, and others, had brought to Perth a
considerable body of horse, of which these were a part.So soon as the
glover and smith presented themselves, they were admitted to the chamber
in which the magistrates were assembled.A woman wails for justice at the gate,
     A widow'd woman, wan and desolate.The council room of Perth presented a singular spectacle.In a gloomy
apartment, ill and inconveniently lighted by two windows of different
form and of unequal size, were assembled, around a large oaken table,
a group of men, of whom those who occupied the higher seats were
merchants, that is, guild brethren, or shopkeepers, arrayed in decent
dresses becoming their station, but most of them bearing, like, the
Regent York, "signs of war around their aged necks"--gorgets, namely,
and baldricks, which sustained their weapons.The lower places around
the table were occupied by mechanics and artisans, the presidents, or
deacons, as they were termed, of the working classes, in their ordinary
clothes, somewhat better arranged than usual.These, too, wore pieces
of armour of various descriptions.Some had the blackjack, or doublets
covered with small plates of iron of a lozenge shape, which, secured
through the upper angle, hung in rows above each [other], and which,
swaying with the motion of the wearer's person, formed a secure defence
to the body.Others had buff coats, which, as already mentioned, could
resist the blow of a sword, and even a lance's point, unless propelled
with great force.At the bottom of the table, surrounded as it was
with this varied assembly, sat Sir Louis Lundin; no military man, but
a priest and parson of St.John's, arrayed in his canonical dress, and
having his pen and ink before him.He was town clerk of the burgh,
and, like all the priests of the period (who were called from that
circumstance the Pope's knights), received the honourable title of
Dominus, contracted into Dom, or Dan, or translated into Sir, the title
of reverence due to the secular chivalry.On an elevated seat at the head of the council board was placed Sir
Patrick Charteris, in complete armour brightly burnished--a singular
contrast to the motley mixture of warlike and peaceful attire exhibited
by the burghers, who were only called to arms occasionally.The bearing
of the provost, while it completely admitted the intimate connexion
which mutual interests had created betwixt himself, the burgh, and the
magistracy, was at the same time calculated to assert the superiority
which, in virtue of gentle blood and chivalrous rank, the opinions of
the age assigned to him over the members of the assembly in which he
presided.Two squires stood behind him, one of them holding the knight's
pennon, and another his shield, bearing his armorial distinctions, being
a hand holding a dagger, or short sword, with the proud motto, "This is
my charter."A handsome page displayed the long sword of his master, and
another bore his lance; all which chivalrous emblems and appurtenances
were the more scrupulously exhibited, that the dignitary to whom they
belonged was engaged in discharging the office of a burgh magistrate.In his own person the Knight of Kinfauns appeared to affect something
of state and stiffness which did not naturally pertain to his frank and
jovial character."So you are come at length, Henry Smith and Simon Glover," said the
provost."Know that you have kept us waiting for your attendance.Should
it so chance again while we occupy this place, we will lay such a
fine on you as you will have small pleasure in paying.They are not asked now, and another time they will not
be admitted.Know, sirs, that our reverend clerk hath taken down in
writing, and at full length, what I will tell you in brief, that you may
see what is to be required of you, Henry Smith, in particular.Our
late fellow citizen, Oliver Proudfute, hath been found dead in the High
Street, close by the entrance into the wynd.It seemeth he was slain by
a heavy blow with a short axe, dealt from behind and at unawares;
and the act by which he fell can only be termed a deed of foul and
forethought murder.The criminal can only be
indicated by circumstances.It is recorded in the protocol of the
Reverend Sir Louis Lundin, that divers well reported witnesses saw our
deceased citizen, Oliver Proudfute, till a late period accompanying the
entry of the morrice dancers, of whom he was one, as far as the house of
Simon Glover, in Curfew Street, where they again played their pageant.It is also manifested that at this place he separated from the rest
of the band, after some discourse with Simon Glover, and made an
appointment to meet with the others of his company at the sign of the
Griffin, there to conclude the holiday.Now, Simon, I demand of you
whether this be truly stated, so far as you know?and further, what was
the purport of the defunct Oliver Proudfute's discourse with you?""My Lord Provost and very worshipful Sir Patrick," answered Simon
Glover, "you and this honourable council shall know that, touching
certain reports which had been made of the conduct of Henry Smith, some
quarrel had arisen between myself and another of my family and the said
Smith here present.Now, this our poor fellow citizen, Oliver Proudfute,
having been active in spreading these reports, as indeed his element lay
in such gossipred, some words passed betwixt him and me on the subject;
and, as I think, he left me with the purpose of visiting Henry Smith,
for he broke off from the morrice dancers, promising, as it seems, to
meet them, as your honour has said, at the sign of the Griffin, in order
to conclude the evening.But what he actually did, I know not, as I
never again saw him in life.""It is enough," said Sir Patrick, "and agrees with all that we have
heard.Now, worthy sirs, we next find our poor fellow citizen environed
by a set of revellers and maskers who had assembled in the High Street,
by whom he was shamefully ill treated, being compelled to kneel down
in the street, and there to quaff huge quantities of liquor against
his inclination, until at length he escaped from them by flight.This violence was accomplished with drawn swords, loud shouts, and
imprecations, so as to attract the attention of several persons, who,
alarmed by the tumult, looked out from their windows, as well as of one
or two passengers, who, keeping aloof from the light of the torches,
lest they also had been maltreated, beheld the usage which our fellow
citizen received in the High Street of the burgh.And although these
revellers were disguised, and used vizards, yet their disguises were
well known, being a set of quaint masking habits prepared some weeks
ago by command of Sir John Ramorny, Master of the Horse to his Royal
Highness the Duke of Rothsay, Prince Royal of Scotland.""Yes, so it is, brave burghers," continued Sir Patrick; "our inquiries
have led us into conclusions both melancholy and terrible.But as no one
can regret the point at which they seem likely to arrive more than I do,
so no man living can dread its consequences less.It is even so, various
artisans employed upon the articles have described the dresses prepared
for Sir John Ramorny's mask as being exactly similar to those of the
men by whom Oliver Proudfute was observed to be maltreated.And one
mechanic, being Wingfield the feather dresser, who saw the revellers
when they had our fellow citizen within their hands, remarked that they
wore the cinctures and coronals of painted feathers which he himself had
made by the order of the Prince's master of horse."After the moment of his escape from these revellers, we lose all trace
of Oliver' but we can prove that the maskers went to Sir John Ramorny's,
where they were admitted, after some show of delay.It is rumoured that
thou, Henry Smith, sawest our unhappy fellow citizen after he had been
in the hands of these revellers."He came to my house in the wynd," said Henry, "about half an hour
before midnight; and I admitted him, something unwillingly, as he had
been keeping carnival while I remained at home; and 'There is ill talk,'
says the proverb, 'betwixt a full man and a fasting.'""And in which plight seemed he when thou didst admit him?""He seemed," answered the smith, "out of breath, and talked repeatedly
of having been endangered by revellers.I paid but small regard, for he
was ever a timorous, chicken spirited, though well meaning, man, and
I held that he was speaking more from fancy than reality.But I shall
always account it for foul offence in myself that I did not give him my
company, which he requested; and if I live, I will found masses for his
soul, in expiation of my guilt.""Did he describe those from whom he received the injury?""Revellers in masking habits," replied Henry."And did he intimate his fear of having to do with them on his return?""He alluded particularly to his being waylaid, which I treated as
visionary, having been able to see no one in the lane.""Had he then no help from thee of any kind whatsoever?""Yes, worshipful," replied the smith; "he exchanged his morrice dress
for my head piece, buff coat, and target, which I hear were found upon
his body; and I have at home his morrice cap and bells, with the jerkin
and other things pertaining.He was to return my garb of fence, and get
back his own masking suit this day, had the saints so permitted.""One word more," said the provost."Have you any reason to think that
the blow which slew Oliver Proudfute was meant for another man?""I have," answered the smith; "but it is doubtful, and may be dangerous
to add such a conjecture, which is besides only a supposition.""Speak it out, on your burgher faith and oath.For whom, think you, was
the blow meant?""If I must speak," replied Henry, "I believe Oliver Proudfute received
the fate which was designed for myself; the rather that, in his folly,
Oliver spoke of trying to assume my manner of walking, as well as my
dress.""Have you feud with any one, that you form such an idea?""To my shame and sin be it spoken, I have feud with Highland and
Lowland, English and Scot, Perth and Angus.I do not believe poor
Oliver had feud with a new hatched chicken.he was the more fully
prepared for a sudden call!""Hark ye, smith," said the provost, "answer me distinctly: Is there
cause of feud between the household of Sir John Ramorny and yourself?""To a certainty, my lord, there is.It is now generally said that Black
Quentin, who went over Tay to Fife some days since, was the owner of the
hand which was found in Couvrefew Street upon the eve of St.It was I who struck off that hand with a blow of my broadsword.As this
Black Quentin was a chamberlain of Sir John, and much trusted, it is
like there must be feud between me and his master's dependants.""It bears a likely front, smith," said Sir Patrick Charteris."And now,
good brothers and wise magistrates, there are two suppositions, each of
which leads to the same conclusion.The maskers who seized our fellow
citizen, and misused him in a manner of which his body retains some
slight marks, may have met with their former prisoner as he returned
homewards, and finished their ill usage by taking his life.He himself
expressed to Henry Gow fears that this would be the case.If this be
really true, one or more of Sir John Ramorny's attendants must have
been the assassins.But I think it more likely that one or two of the
revellers may have remained on the field, or returned to it, having
changed perhaps their disguise, and that to those men (for Oliver
Proudfute, in his own personal appearance, would only have been a
subject of sport) his apparition in the dress, and assuming, as he
proposed to do, the manner, of Henry Smith, was matter of deep hatred;
and that, seeing him alone, they had taken, as they thought, a certain
and safe mode to rid themselves of an enemy so dangerous as all men know
Henry Wynd is accounted by those that are his unfriends.The same train
of reasoning, again, rests the guilt with the household of Sir John
Ramorny.Are we not free to charge the crime upon
them?"The magistrates whispered together for several minutes, and then replied
by the voice of Bailie Craigdallie: "Noble knight, and our worthy
provost, we agree entirely in what your wisdom has spoken concerning
this dark and bloody matter; nor do we doubt your sagacity in tracing to
the fellowship and the company of John Ramorny of that ilk the villainy
which hath been done to our deceased fellow citizen, whether in his own
character and capacity or as mistaking him for our brave townsman, Henry
of the Wynd.But Sir John, in his own behalf, and as the Prince's master
of the horse, maintains an extensive household; and as, of course, the
charge will be rebutted by a denial, we would ask how we shall proceed
in that case.It is true, could we find law for firing the lodging, and
putting all within it to the sword; the old proverb of 'Short rede,
good rede,' might here apply; for a fouler household of defiers of God,
destroyers of men, and debauchers of women are nowhere sheltered than
are in Ramorny's band.But I doubt that this summary mode of execution
would scarce be borne out by the laws; and no tittle of evidence which
I have heard will tend to fix the crime on any single individual or
individuals."Before the provost could reply, the town clerk arose, and, stroking
his venerable beard, craved permission to speak, which was instantly
granted."Brethren," he said, "as well in our fathers' time as ours; hath God, on
being rightly appealed to, condescended to make manifest the crimes of
the guilty and the innocence of those who may have been rashly accused.Let us demand from our sovereign lord, King Robert, who, when the wicked
do not interfere to pervert his good intentions, is as just and clement
a prince as our annals can show in their long line, in the name of the
Fair City, and of all the commons in Scotland, that he give us, after
the fashion of our ancestors, the means of appealing to Heaven for light
upon this dark murder, we will demand the proof by 'bier right,' often
granted in the days of our sovereign's ancestors, approved of by bulls
and decretals, and administered by the great Emperor Charlemagne in
France, by King Arthur in Britain, and by Gregory the Great, and the
mighty Achaius, in this our land of Scotland.""I have heard of the bier right, Sir Louis," quoth the provost, "and I
know we have it in our charters of the Fair City; but I am something
ill learned in the ancient laws, and would pray you to inform us more
distinctly of its nature.""We will demand of the King," said Sir Louis Lundin, "my advice being
taken, that the body of our murdered fellow citizen be transported into
the High Church of St.John, and suitable masses said for the benefit
of his soul and for the discovery of his foul murder.Meantime, we shall
obtain an order that Sir John Ramorny give up a list of such of his
household as were in Perth in the course of the night between Fastern's
Even and this Ash Wednesday, and become bound to present them on a
certain day and hour, to be early named, in the High Church of St.John,
there one by one to pass before the bier of our murdered fellow citizen,
and in the form prescribed to call upon God and His saints to bear
witness that he is innocent of the acting, art or part, of the murder.And credit me, as has been indeed proved by numerous instances, that, if
the murderer shall endeavour to shroud himself by making such an appeal,
the antipathy which subsists between the dead body and the hand which
dealt the fatal blow that divorced it from the soul will awaken some
imperfect life, under the influence of which the veins of the dead man
will pour forth at the fatal wounds the blood which has been so long
stagnant in the veins.Or, to speak more certainly, it is the pleasure
of Heaven, by some hidden agency which we cannot comprehend, to leave
open this mode of discovering the wickedness of him who has defaced the
image of his Creator.""I have heard this law talked of," said Sir Patrick, "and it was
enforced in the Bruce's time.This surely is no unfit period to seek, by
such a mystic mode of inquiry, the truth to which no ordinary means can
give us access, seeing that a general accusation of Sir John's household
would full surely be met by a general denial.Yet I must crave farther
of Sir Louis, our reverend town clerk, how we shall prevent the guilty
person from escaping in the interim?""The burghers will maintain a strict watch upon the wall, drawbridges
shall be raised and portcullises lowered, from sunset to sunrise, and
strong patrols maintained through the night.This guard the burghers
will willingly maintain, to secure against the escape of the murderer of
their townsman."The rest of the counsellors acquiesced, by word, sign, and look, in this
proposal."Again," said the provost, "what if any one of the suspected household
refuse to submit to the ordeal of bier right?""He may appeal to that of combat," said the reverend city scribe, "with
an opponent of equal rank; because the accused person must have his
choice, in the appeal to the judgment of God, by what ordeal he will
be tried.But if he refuses both, he must be held as guilty, and so
punished."The sages of the council unanimously agreed with the opinion of their
provost and town clerk, and resolved, in all formality, to petition
the King, as a matter of right, that the murder of their fellow citizen
should be inquired into according to this ancient form, which was held
to manifest the truth, and received as matter of evidence in case of
murder so late as towards the end of the 17th century.But before the
meeting dissolved, Bailie Craigdallie thought it meet to inquire who
was to be the champion of Maudie, or Magdalen, Proudfute and her two
children."There need be little inquiry about that," said Sir Patrick Charteris;
"we are men, and wear swords, which should be broken over the head
of any one amongst us who will not draw it in behalf of the widow and
orphans of our murdered fellow citizen, and in brave revenge of his
death.If Sir John Ramorny shall personally resent the inquiry, Patrick
Charteris of Kinfauns will do battle with him to the outrance, whilst
horse and man may stand, or spear and blade hold together.But in case
the challenger be of yeomanly degree, well wot I that Magdalen Proudfute
may choose her own champion among the bravest burghers of Perth, and
shame and dishonour were it to the Fair City for ever could she light
upon one who were traitor and coward enough to say her nay!Bring her
hither, that she may make her election."Henry Smith heard this with a melancholy anticipation that the poor
woman's choice would light upon him, and that his recent reconciliation
with his mistress would be again dissolved, by his being engaged in a
fresh quarrel, from which there lay no honourable means of escape, and
which, in any other circumstances, he would have welcomed as a glorious
opportunity of distinguishing himself, both in sight of the court and
of the city.He was aware that, under the tuition of Father Clement,
Catharine viewed the ordeal of battle rather as an insult to religion
than an appeal to the Deity, and did not consider it as reasonable that
superior strength of arm or skill of weapon should be resorted to as the
proof of moral guilt or innocence.He had, therefore, much to fear from
her peculiar opinions in this particular, refined as they were beyond
those of the age she lived in.While he thus suffered under these contending feelings, Magdalen,
the widow of the slaughtered man, entered the court, wrapt in a deep
mourning veil, and followed and supported by five or six women of good
(that is, of respectability) dressed in the same melancholy attire.One
of her attendants held an infant in her arms, the last pledge of poor
Oliver's nuptial affections.Another led a little tottering creature of
two years, or thereabouts, which looked with wonder and fear, sometimes
on the black dress in which they had muffled him, and sometimes on the
scene around him.The assembly rose to receive the melancholy group, and saluted them with
an expression of the deepest sympathy, which Magdalen, though the mate
of poor Oliver, returned with an air of dignity, which she borrowed,
perhaps, from the extremity of her distress.Sir Patrick Charteris then
stepped forward, and with the courtesy of a knight to a female, and of a
protector to an oppressed and injured widow, took the poor woman's hand,
and explained to her briefly by what course the city had resolved to
follow out the vengeance due for her husband's slaughter.Having, with a softness and gentleness which did not belong to his
general manner, ascertained that the unfortunate woman perfectly
understood what was meant, he said aloud to the assembly: "Good citizens
of Perth, and freeborn men of guild and craft, attend to what is
about to pass, for it concerns your rights and privileges.Here stands
Magdalen Proudfute, desirous to follow forth the revenge due for the
death of her husband, foully murdered, as she sayeth, by Sir John
Ramorny, Knight, of that Ilk, and which she offers to prove, by the
evidence of bier right, or by the body of a man.Therefore, I, Patrick
Charteris, being a belted knight and freeborn gentleman, offer myself to
do battle in her just quarrel, whilst man and horse may endure, if any
one of my degree shall lift my glove.How say you, Magdalen Proudfute,
will you accept me for your champion?"The widow answered with difficulty: "I can desire none nobler."Sir Patrick then took her right hand in his, and, kissing her forehead,
for such was the ceremony, said solemnly: "So may God and St.John
prosper me at my need, as I will do my devoir as your champion,
knightly, truly, and manfully.Go now, Magdalen, and choose at your will
among the burgesses of the Fair City, present or absent, any one upon
whom you desire to rest your challenge, if he against whom you bring
plaint shall prove to be beneath my degree."All eyes were turned to Henry Smith, whom the general voice had already
pointed out as in every respect the fittest to act as champion on the
occasion.But the widow waited not for the general prompting of their
looks.As soon as Sir Patrick had spoken, she crossed the floor to the
place where, near the bottom of the table, the armourer stood among the
men of his degree, and took him by the hand."Henry Gow, or Smith," she said, "good burgher and draftsman, my--my--"

"Husband," she would have said, but the word would not come forth: she
was obliged to change the expression."He who is gone, loved and prized you over all men; therefore meet it is
that thou shouldst follow out the quarrel of his widow and orphans."If there had been a possibility, which in that age there was not, of
Henry's rejecting or escaping from a trust for which all men seemed to
destine him, every wish and idea of retreat was cut off when the widow
began to address him; and a command from Heaven could hardly have made a
stronger impression than did the appeal of the unfortunate Magdalen.Her
allusion to his intimacy with the deceased moved him to the soul.During
Oliver's life, doubtless, there had been a strain of absurdity in his
excessive predilection for Henry, which, considering how very different
they were in character, had in it something ludicrous.But all this
was now forgotten, and Henry, giving way to his natural ardour, only
remembered that Oliver had been his friend and intimate--a man who had
loved and honoured him as much as he was capable of entertaining such
sentiments for any one, and, above all, that there was much reason to
suspect that the deceased had fallen victim to a blow meant for Henry
himself.It was, therefore, with an alacrity which, the minute before, he could
scarce have commanded, and which seemed to express a stern pleasure,
that, having pressed his lips to the cold brow of the unhappy Magdalen,
the armourer replied:

"I, Henry the Smith, dwelling in the Wynd of Perth, good man and true,
and freely born, accept the office of champion to this widow Magdalen
and these orphans, and will do battle in their quarrel to the death,
with any man whomsoever of my own degree, and that so long as I shall
draw breath.So help me at my need God and good St.There arose from the audience a half suppressed cry, expressing the
interest which the persons present took in the prosecution of the
quarrel, and their confidence in the issue.Sir Patrick Charteris then took measures for repairing to the King's
presence, and demanding leave to proceed with inquiry into the murder
of Oliver Proudfute, according to the custom of bier right, and, if
necessary, by combat.He performed this duty after the town council had dissolved, in a
private interview between himself and the King, who heard of this new
trouble with much vexation, and appointed next morning, after mass,
for Sir Patrick and the parties interested to attend his pleasure in
council.In the mean time, a royal pursuivant was despatched to the
Constable's lodgings, to call over the roll of Sir John Ramorny's
attendants, and charge him, with his whole retinue, under high
penalties, to abide within Perth until the King's pleasure should be
farther known.In God's name, see the lists and all things fit;
     There let them end it--God defend the right!In the same council room of the conventual palace of the Dominicans,
King Robert was seated with his brother Albany, whose affected austerity
of virtue, and real art and dissimulation, maintained so high an
influence over the feeble minded monarch.It was indeed natural that one
who seldom saw things according to their real forms and outlines should
view them according to the light in which they were presented to him by
a bold, astucious man, possessing the claim of such near relationship.Ever anxious on account of his misguided and unfortunate son, the King
was now endeavouring to make Albany coincide in opinion with him in
exculpating Rothsay from any part in the death of the bonnet maker, the
precognition concerning which had been left by Sir Patrick Charteris for
his Majesty's consideration."This is an unhappy matter, brother Robin," he said--"a most unhappy
occurrence, and goes nigh to put strife and quarrel betwixt the nobility
and the commons here, as they have been at war together in so many
distant lands.I see but one cause of comfort in the matter, and that
is, that Sir John Ramorny having received his dismissal from the Duke of
Rothsay's family, it cannot be said that he or any of his people who may
have done this bloody deed--if it has truly been done by them--have been
encouraged or hounded out upon such an errand by my poor boy.I am sure,
brother, you and I can bear witness how readily, upon my entreaties, he
agreed to dismiss Ramorny from his service, on account of that brawl in
Curfew Street.""I remember his doing so," said Albany; "and well do I hope that the
connexion betwixt the Prince and Ramorny has not been renewed since he
seemed to comply with your Grace's wishes.""What mean you
by these expressions, brother?Surely, when David promised to me that,
if that unhappy matter of Curfew Street were but smothered up and
concealed, he would part with Ramorny, as he was a counsellor thought
capable of involving him in similar fooleries, and would acquiesce
in our inflicting on him either exile or such punishment as it should
please us to impose--surely you cannot doubt that he was sincere in his
professions, and would keep his word?Remember you not that, when you
advised that a heavy fine should be levied upon his estate in Fife in
lieu of banishment, the Prince himself seemed to say that exile would be
better for Ramorny, and even for himself?""I remember it well, my royal brother.Nor, truly, could I have
suspected Ramorny of having so much influence over the Prince, after
having been accessory to placing him in a situation so perilous, had
it not been for my royal kinsman's own confession, alluded to by your
Grace, that, if suffered to remain at court, he might still continue to
influence his conduct.I then regretted I had advised a fine in place
of exile.But that time is passed, and now new mischief has occurred,
fraught with much peril to your Majesty, as well as to your royal heir,
and to the whole kingdom."by the soul of Bruce, our immortal ancestor!I entreat thee, my
dearest brother, to take compassion on me.Tell me what evil threatens
my son, or my kingdom?"The features of the King, trembling with anxiety, and his eyes brimful
of tears, were bent upon his brother, who seemed to assume time for
consideration ere he replied.Your Grace believed that the Prince had
no accession to this second aggression upon the citizens of Perth--the
slaughter of this bonnet making fellow, about whose death they clamour,
as a set of gulls about their comrade, when one of the noisy brood is
struck down by a boor's shaft.""Their lives," said the King, "are dear to themselves and their friends,
Robin.""Truly, ay, my liege; and they make them dear to us too, ere we can
settle with the knaves for the least blood wit.But, as I said, your
Majesty thinks the Prince had no share in this last slaughter; I will
not attempt to shake your belief in that delicate point, but will
endeavour to believe along with you.What you think is rule for me,
Robert of Albany will never think otherwise than Robert of broad
Scotland.""Thank you, thank you," said the King, taking his brother's hand."I
knew I might rely that your affection would do justice to poor heedless
Rothsay, who exposes himself to so much misconstruction that he scarcely
deserves the sentiments you feel for him."Albany had such an immovable constancy of purpose, that he was able to
return the fraternal pressure of the King's hand, while tearing up by
the very roots the hopes of the indulgent, fond old man.the Duke continued, with a sigh, "this burly, intractable
Knight of Kinfauns, and his brawling herd of burghers, will not view the
matter as we do.They have the boldness to say that this dead fellow had
been misused by Rothsay and his fellows, who were in the street in mask
and revel, stopping men and women, compelling them to dance, or to drink
huge quantities of wine, with other follies needless to recount; and
they say that the whole party repaired in Sir John Ramorny's, and broke
their way into the house in order to conclude their revel there, thus
affording good reason to judge that the dismissal of Sir John from the
Prince's service was but a feigned stratagem to deceive the public.And
hence they urge that, if ill were done that night by Sir John Ramorny
or his followers, much it is to be thought that the Duke of Rothsay must
have at least been privy to, if he did not authorise, it.""Would they make a murderer
of my boy?would they pretend my David would soil his hands in Scottish
blood without having either provocation or purpose?No--no, they will
not invent calumnies so broad as these, for they are flagrant and
incredible.""Pardon, my liege," answered the Duke of Albany; "they say the cause
of quarrel which occasioned the riot in Curfew Street, and, its
consequences, were more proper to the Prince than to Sir John, since
none suspects, far less believes, that that hopeful enterprise was
conducted for the gratification of the knight of Ramorny.""Thou drivest me mad, Robin!""I am dumb," answered his brother; "I did but speak my poor mind
according to your royal order.""Thou meanest well, I know," said the King; "but, instead of tearing me
to pieces with the display of inevitable calamities, were it not kinder,
Robin, to point me out some mode to escape from them?""True, my liege; but as the only road of extrication is rough and
difficult, it is necessary your Grace should be first possessed with
the absolute necessity of using it, ere you hear it even described.The
chirurgeon must first convince his patient of the incurable condition of
a shattered member, ere he venture to name amputation, though it be the
only remedy."The King at these words was roused to a degree of alarm and indignation
greater than his brother had deemed he could be awakened to."Shattered and mortified member, my Lord of Albany!These are unintelligible words, my lord.If thou appliest them
to our son Rothsay, thou must make them good to the letter, else mayst
thou have bitter cause to rue the consequence.""You construe me too literally, my royal liege," said Albany."I spoke
not of the Prince in such unbeseeming terms, for I call Heaven to
witness that he is dearer to me as the son of a well beloved brother
than had he been son of my own.But I spoke in regard to separating him
from the follies and vanities of life, which holy men say are like to
mortified members, and ought, like them, to be cut off and thrown from
us, as things which interrupt our progress in better things.""I understand--thou wouldst have this Ramorny, who hath been thought the
instrument of my son's follies, exiled from court," said the relieved
monarch, "until these unhappy scandals are forgotten, and our subjects
are disposed to look upon our son with different and more confiding
eyes.""That were good counsel, my liege; but mine went a little--a very
little--farther.I would have the Prince himself removed for some brief
period from court."part with my child, my firstborn, the light of my eyes,
and--wilful as he is--the darling of my heart!"Nay, I did but suggest, my lord; I am sensible of the wound such a
proceeding must inflict on a parent's heart, for am I not myself a
father?"And he hung his head, as if in hopeless despondency.When I think that even our own
influence over him, which, sometimes forgotten in our absence, is ever
effectual whilst he is with us, is by your plan to be entirely removed,
what perils might he not rush upon?I could not sleep in his absence--I
should hear his death groan in every breeze; and you, Albany, though you
conceal it better, would be nearly as anxious."Thus spoke the facile monarch, willing to conciliate his brother and
cheat himself, by taking it for granted that an affection, of which
there were no traces, subsisted betwixt the uncle and nephew."Your paternal apprehensions are too easily alarmed, my lord," said
Albany."I do not propose to leave the disposal of the Prince's motions
to his own wild pleasure.I understand that the Prince is to be placed
for a short time under some becoming restraint--that he should
be subjected to the charge of some grave counsellor, who must be
responsible both for his conduct and his safety, as a tutor for his
pupil."a tutor, and at Rothsay's age!"exclaimed the' King; "he is two
years beyond the space to which our laws limit the term of nonage.""The wiser Romans," said Albany, "extended it for four years after the
period we assign; and, in common sense, the right of control ought to
last till it be no longer necessary, and so the time ought to vary with
the disposition.Here is young Lindsay, the Earl of Crawford, who they
say gives patronage to Ramorny on this appeal.He is a lad of fifteen,
with the deep passions and fixed purpose of a man of thirty; while my
royal nephew, with much more amiable and noble qualities both of head
and heart, sometimes shows, at twenty-three years of age, the wanton
humours of a boy, towards whom restraint may be kindness.And do not
be discouraged that it is so, my liege, or angry with your brother for
telling the truth; since the best fruits are those that are slowest in
ripening, and the best horses such as give most trouble to the grooms
who train them for the field or lists."The Duke stopped, and, after suffering King Robert to indulge for two
or three minutes in a reverie which he did not attempt to interrupt, he
added, in a more lively tone: "But, cheer up, my noble liege; perhaps
the feud may be made up without farther fighting or difficulty.The
widow is poor, for her husband, though he was much employed, had idle
and costly habits.The matter may be therefore redeemed for money, and
the amount of an assythment may be recovered out of Ramorny's estate.""Nay, that we will ourselves discharge," said King Robert, eagerly
catching at the hope of a pacific termination of this unpleasing debate."Ramorny's prospects will be destroyed by his being sent from court
and deprived of his charge in Rothsay's household, and it would be
ungenerous to load a falling man.But here comes our secretary, the
prior, to tell us the hour of council approaches."Benedicite, my royal liege," answered the abbot."Now, good father," continued the King, "without waiting for Rothsay,
whose accession to our counsels we will ourselves guarantee, proceed we
to the business of our kingdom."He has arrived at his castle of Tantallon, my liege, and has sent a
post to say, that, though the Earl of March remains in sullen seclusion
in his fortress of Dunbar, his friends and followers are gathering and
forming an encampment near Coldingham, Where it is supposed they intend
to await the arrival of a large force of English, which Hotspur and Sir
Ralph Percy are assembling on the English frontier.""That is cold news," said the King; "and may God forgive George of
Dunbar!"The Prince entered as he spoke, and he continued: "Ha!thou art here at
length, Rothsay; I saw thee not at mass.""I was an idler this morning," said the Prince, "having spent a restless
and feverish night."answered the King; "hadst thou not been over restless
on Fastern's Eve, thou hadst not been feverish on the night of Ash
Wednesday.""Let me not interrupt your praying, my liege," said the Prince,
lightly."Your Grace Was invoking Heaven in behalf of some one--an enemy
doubtless, for these have the frequent advantage of your orisons.""Sit down and be at peace, foolish youth!"said his father, his eye
resting at the same time on the handsome face and graceful figure of
his favourite son.Rothsay drew a cushion near to his father's feet, and
threw himself carelessly down upon it, while the King resumed."I was regretting that the Earl of March, having separated warm from
my hand with full assurance that he should receive compensation for
everything which he could complain of as injurious, should have been
capable of caballing with Northumberland against his own country.Is it
possible he could doubt our intentions to make good our word?""I will answer for him--no," said the Prince."March never doubted your
Highness's word.Marry, he may well have made question whether your
learned counsellors would leave your Majesty the power of keeping it."Robert the Third had adopted to a great extent the timid policy of not
seeming to hear expressions which, being heard, required, even in his
own eyes, some display of displeasure.He passed on, therefore, in his
discourse, without observing his son's speech, but in private Rothsay's
rashness augmented the displeasure which his father began to entertain
against him."It is well the Douglas is on the marches," said the King."His
breast, like those of his ancestors, has ever been the best bulwark of
Scotland.""Then woe betide us if he should turn his back to the enemy," said the
incorrigible Rothsay."Dare you impeach the courage of Douglas?"replied the King, extremely
chafed."No man dare question the Earl's courage," said Rothsay, "it is as
certain as his pride; but his luck may be something doubted."Andrew, David," exclaimed his father, "thou art like a screech
owl, every word thou sayest betokens strife and calamity.""I am silent, father," answered the youth.continued the King,
addressing the prior."I trust they have assumed a favourable aspect," answered the clergyman."The fire which threatened the whole country is likely to be drenched
out by the blood of some forty or fifty kerne; for the two great
confederacies have agreed, by solemn indenture of arms, to decided their
quarrel with such weapons as your Highness may name, and in your royal
presence, in such place as shall be appointed, on the 30th of March next
to come, being Palm Sunday; the number of combatants being limited to
thirty on each side; and the fight to be maintained to extremity, since
they affectionately make humble suit and petition to your Majesty that
you will parentally condescend to waive for the day your royal privilege
of interrupting the combat, by flinging down of truncheon or crying of
'Ho!'until the battle shall be utterly fought to an end."exclaimed the King, "would they limit our best and
dearest royal privilege, that of putting a stop to strife, and crying
truce to battle?Will they remove the only motive which could bring me
to the butcherly spectacle of their combat?Would they fight like men,
or like their own mountain wolves?""My lord," said Albany, "the Earl of Crawford and I had presumed,
without consulting you, to ratify that preliminary, for the adoption of
which we saw much and pressing reason.""Methinks he is a young
counsellor on such grave occurrents.""He is," replied Albany, "notwithstanding his early years, of such
esteem among his Highland neighbours, that I could have done little with
them but for his aid and influence."said the King reproachfully to his heir."I pity Crawford, sire," replied the Prince."He has too early lost a
father whose counsels would have better become such a season as this."The King turned next towards Albany with a look of triumph, at the
filial affection which his son displayed in his reply."It is not the life of these
Highlandmen, but their death, which is to be profitable to this
commonwealth of Scotland; and truly it seemed to the Earl of Crawford
and myself most desirable that the combat should be a strife of
extermination.""Marry," said the Prince, "if such be the juvenile policy of Lindsay, he
will be a merciful ruler some ten or twelve years hence!Out upon a boy
that is hard of heart before he has hair upon his lip!Better he had
contented himself with fighting cocks on Fastern's Even than laying
schemes for massacring men on Palm Sunday, as if he were backing a Welsh
main, where all must fight to death.""Rothsay is right, Albany," said the King: "it were unlike a Christian
monarch to give way in this point.I cannot consent to see men battle
until they are all hewn down like cattle in the shambles.It would
sicken me to look at it, and the warder would drop from my hand for mere
lack of strength to hold it.""It would drop unheeded," said Albany."Let me entreat your Grace to
recollect, that you only give up a royal privilege which, exercised,
would win you no respect, since it would receive no obedience.Were your
Majesty to throw down your warder when the war is high, and these men's
blood is hot, it would meet no more regard than if a sparrow should drop
among a herd of battling wolves the straw which he was carrying to his
nest.Nothing will separate them but the exhaustion of slaughter; and
better they sustain it at the hands of each other than from the swords
of such troops as might attempt to separate them at your Majesty's
commands.An attempt to keep the peace by violence would be construed
into an ambush laid for them; both parties would unite to resist it, the
slaughter would be the same, and the hoped for results of future peace
would be utterly disappointed.""There is even too much truth in what you say, brother Robin," replied
the flexible King."To little purpose is it to command what I cannot
enforce; and, although I have the unhappiness to do so each day of
my life, it were needless to give such a very public example of royal
impotency before the crowds who may assemble to behold this spectacle.Let these savage men, therefore, work their bloody will to the uttermost
upon each other: I will not attempt to forbid what I cannot prevent them
from executing.I will to my oratory
and pray for her, since to aid her by hand and head is alike denied to
me.Father prior, I pray the support of your arm.""Nay, but, brother," said Albany, "forgive me if I remind you that we
must hear the matter between the citizens of Perth and Ramorny, about
the death of a townsman--"

"True--true," said the monarch, reseating himself; "more violence--more
battle.if the best blood of thy bravest
children could enrich thy barren soil, what land on earth would excel
thee in fertility!When is it that a white hair is seen on the beard of
a Scottishman, unless he be some wretch like thy sovereign, protected
from murder by impotence, to witness the scenes of slaughter to which he
cannot put a period?They are in haste
to kill, and, grudge each other each fresh breath of their Creator's
blessed air.The demon of strife and slaughter hath possessed the whole
land!"As the mild prince threw himself back on his seat with an air of
impatience and anger not very usual with him, the door at the lower end
of the room was unclosed, and, advancing from the gallery into which
it led (where in perspective was seen a guard of the Bute men, or
Brandanes, under arms), came, in mournful procession, the widow of poor
Oliver, led by Sir Patrick Charteris, with as much respect as if she had
been a lady of the first rank.Behind them came two women of good, the
wives of magistrates of the city, both in mourning garments, one bearing
the infant and the other leading the elder child.The smith followed in
his best attire, and wearing over his buff coat a scarf of crape.Bailie
Craigdallie and a brother magistrate closed the melancholy procession,
exhibiting similar marks of mourning.The good King's transitory passion was gone the instant he looked at
the pallid countenance of the sorrowing widow, and beheld the
unconsciousness of the innocent orphans who had sustained so great a
loss, and when Sir Patrick Charteris had assisted Magdalen Proudfute to
kneel down and, still holding her hand, kneeled himself on one knee,
it was with a sympathetic tone that King Robert asked her name and
business.She made no answer, but muttered something, looking towards
her conductor."Speak for the poor woman, Sir Patrick Charteris," said the King, "and
tell us the cause of her seeking our presence.""So please you, my liege," answered Sir Patrick, rising up, "this woman,
and these unhappy orphans, make plaint to your Highness upon Sir John
Ramorny of Ramorny, Knight, that by him, or by some of his household,
her umquhile husband, Oliver Proudfute, freeman and burgess of Perth,
was slain upon the streets of the city on the eve of Shrove Tuesday or
morning of Ash Wednesday.""Woman," replied the King, with much kindness, "thou art gentle by sex,
and shouldst be pitiful even by thy affliction; for our own calamity
ought to make us--nay, I think it doth make us--merciful to others.Thy
husband hath only trodden the path appointed to us all.""In his case," said the widow, "my liege must remember it has been a
brief and a bloody one."But since I have been unable to
protect him, as I confess was my royal duty, I am willing, in atonement,
to support thee and these orphans, as well or better than you lived in
the days of your husband; only do thou pass from this charge, and be
not the occasion of spilling more life.Remember, I put before you the
choice betwixt practising mercy and pursuing vengeance, and that betwixt
plenty and penury.""It is true, my liege, we are poor," answered the widow, with unshaken
firmness "but I and my children will feed with the beasts of the field
ere we live on the price of my husband's blood.I demand the combat by
my champion, as you are belted knight and crowned king.""In Scotland
the first words stammered by an infant and the last uttered by a dying
greybeard are 'combat--blood--revenge.'He was dressed in a long furred
robe, such as men of quality wore when they were unarmed.Concealed by
the folds of drapery, his wounded arm was supported by a scarf or
sling of crimson silk, and with the left arm he leaned on a youth,
who, scarcely beyond the years of boyhood, bore on his brow the deep
impression of early thought and premature passion.This was that
celebrated Lindsay, Earl of Crawford, who, in his after days, was known
by the epithet of the Tiger Earl, and who ruled the great and rich
valley of Strathmore with the absolute power and unrelenting cruelty of
a feudal tyrant.Two or three gentlemen, friends of the Earl, or of his
own, countenanced Sir John Ramorny by their presence on this occasion.The charge was again stated, and met by a broad denial on the part
of the accused; and in reply, the challengers offered to prove their
assertion by an appeal to the ordeal of bier right."I am not bound," answered Sir John Ramorny, "to submit to this ordeal,
since I can prove, by the evidence of my late royal master, that I was
in my own lodgings, lying on my bed, ill at ease, while this provost and
these bailies pretend I was committing a crime to which I had neither
will nor temptation.I can therefore be no just object of suspicion.""I can aver," said the Prince, "that I saw and conversed with Sir John
Ramorny about some matters concerning my own household on the very night
when this murder was a-doing.I therefore know that he was ill at ease,
and could not in person commit the deed in question.But I know nothing
of the employment of his attendants, and will not take it upon me to say
that some one of them may not have been guilty of the crime now charged
on them."Sir John Ramorny had, during the beginning of this speech, looked
round with an air of defiance, which was somewhat disconcerted by the
concluding sentence of Rothsay's speech."I thank your Highness," he said, with a smile, "for your cautious and
limited testimony in my behalf.He was wise who wrote, 'Put not your
faith in princes.'""If you have no other evidence of your innocence, Sir John Ramorny,"
said the King, "we may not, in respect to your followers, refuse to
the injured widow and orphans, the complainers, the grant of a proof by
ordeal of bier right, unless any of them should prefer that of combat.For yourself, you are, by the Prince's evidence, freed from the
attaint.""My liege," answered Sir John, "I can take warrant upon myself for the
innocence of my household and followers.""Why, so a monk or a woman might speak," said Sir Patrick Charteris."In
knightly language, wilt thou, Sir John de Ramorny, do battle with me in
the behalf of thy followers?""The provost of Perth had not obtained time to name the word combat,"
said Ramorny, "ere I would have accepted it.But I am not at present fit
to hold a lance.""I am glad of it, under your favour, Sir John.There will be the less
bloodshed," said the King."You must therefore produce your followers
according to your steward's household book, in the great church of
St.John, that, in presence of all whom it may concern, they may purge
themselves of this accusation.See that every man of them do appear at
the time of high mass, otherwise your honour may be sorely tainted.""They shall attend to a man," said Sir John Ramorny.Then bowing low to the King, he directed himself to the young Duke of
Rothsay, and, making a deep obeisance, spoke so as to be heard by him
alone."You have used me generously, my lord!One word of your lips
could have ended this controversy, and you have refused to speak it.""On my life," whispered the Prince, "I spake as far as the extreme verge
of truth and conscience would permit.I think thou couldst not expect
I should frame lies for thee; and after all, John, in my broken
recollections of that night, I do bethink me of a butcherly looking
mute, with a curtal axe, much like such a one as may have done yonder
night job.Ramorny made no answer, but turned as precipitately as if some one had
pressed suddenly on his wounded arm, and regained his lodgings with
the Earl of Crawford; to whom, though disposed for anything rather than
revelry, he was obliged to offer a splendid collation, to acknowledge
in some degree his sense of the countenance which the young noble had
afforded him.In pottingry he wrocht great pyne;
     He murdreit mony in medecyne.When, after an entertainment the prolonging of which was like torture to
the wounded knight, the Earl of Crawford at length took horse, to go
to his distant quarters in the Castle of Dupplin, where he resided as
a guest, the Knight of Ramorny retired into his sleeping apartment,
agonized by pains of body and anxiety of mind.Here he found Henbane
Dwining, on whom it was his hard fate to depend for consolation in both
respects.The physician, with his affectation of extreme humility, hoped
he saw his exalted patient merry and happy."Merry as a mad dog," said Ramorny, "and happy as the wretch whom the
cur hath bitten, and who begins to feel the approach of the ravening
madness!That ruthless boy, Crawford, saw my agony, and spared not a
single carouse.I must do him justice, forsooth!If I had done justice
to him and to the world, I had thrown him out of window and cut short
a career which, if he grew up as he has begun, will prove a source of
misery to all Scotland, but especially to Tayside.Take heed as thou
undoest the ligatures, chirurgeon, the touch of a fly's wing on that raw
glowing stump were like a dagger to me.""Fear not, my noble patron," said the leech, with a chuckling laugh
of enjoyment, which he vainly endeavoured to disguise under a tone of
affected sensibility."We will apply some fresh balsam, and--he, he,
he!--relieve your knightly honour of the irritation which you sustain so
firmly."said Ramorny, grinning with pain; "I sustain it as I
would the scorching flames of purgatory.The bone seems made of red hot
iron; thy greasy ointment will hiss as it drops upon the wound.And yet
it is December's ice, compared to the fever fit of my mind!""We will first use our emollients upon the body, my noble patron," said
Dwining; "and then, with your knighthood's permission; your servant will
try his art on the troubled mind; though I fain hope even the mental
pain also may in some degree depend on the irritation of the wound, and
that, abated as I trust the corporeal pangs will soon be, perhaps the
stormy feelings of the mind may subside of themselves.""Henbane Dwining," said the patient, as he felt the pain of his wound
assuaged, "thou art a precious and invaluable leech, but some things
are beyond thy power.Thou canst stupify my bodily cause of this raging
agony, but thou canst not teach me to bear the score of the boy whom I
have brought up--whom I loved, Dwining--for I did love him--dearly love
him!The worst of my ill deeds have been to flatter his vices; and he
grudged me a word of his mouth, when a word would have allayed this
cumber!He smiled, too--I saw him smile--when yon paltry provost,
the companion and patron of wretched burghers, defied me, whom this
heartless prince knew to be unable to bear arms.Ere I forget or forgive
it, thou thyself shalt preach up the pardoning of injuries!Think'st thou, Henbane Dwining, that, in very
reality, the Wounds of the slaughtered corpse will gape and shed tears
of fresh blood at the murderer's approach?""I cannot tell, my lord, save by report," said Dwining, "which avouches
the fact.""The brute Bonthron," said Ramorny, "is startled at the apprehension of
such a thing, and speaking of being rather willing to stand the combat."It is the armourer's trade to deal with steel," replied Dwining."Were Bonthron to fall, it would little grieve me," said Ramorny;
"though I should miss an useful hand.""I well believe your lordship will not sorrow as for that you lost in
Curfew Street.Excuse my pleasantry, he, he!But what are the useful
properties of this fellow Bonthron?""Those of a bulldog," answered the knight, "he worries without barking.""You have no fear of his confessing?""Who can tell what the dread of approaching death may do?""He has already shown a timorousness entirely alien from his
ordinary sullenness of nature; he, that would scarce wash his hands
after he had slain a man, is now afraid to see a dead body bleed.""Well," said the leech, "I must do something for him if I can, since it
was to further my revenge that he struck yonder downright blow, though
by ill luck it lighted not where it was intended.""And whose fault was that, timid villain," said Ramorny, "save thine
own, who marked a rascal deer for a buck of the first head?""Benedicite, noble sir," replied the mediciner; "would you have me, who
know little save of chamber practice, be as skilful of woodcraft as
your noble self, or tell hart from hind, doe from roe, in a glade at
midnight?I misdoubted me little when I saw the figure run past us to
the smith's habitation in the wynd, habited like a morrice dancer; and
yet my mind partly misgave me whether it was our man, for methought he
seemed less of stature.But when he came out again, after so much time
as to change his dress, and swaggered onward with buff coat and steel
cap, whistling after the armourer's wonted fashion, I do own I was
mistaken super totam materiem, and loosed your knighthood's bulldog upon
him, who did his devoir most duly, though he pulled down the wrong deer.Therefore, unless the accursed smith kill our poor friend stone dead on
the spot, I am determined, if art may do it, that the ban dog Bonthron
shall not miscarry.""It will put thine art to the test, man of medicine," said Ramorny; "for
know that, having the worst of the combat, if our champion be not killed
stone dead in the lists, he will be drawn forth of them by the heels,
and without further ceremony knitted up to the gallows, as convicted of
the murder; and when he hath swung there like a loose tassel for an
hour or so, I think thou wilt hardly take it in hand to cure his broken
neck.""I am of a different opinion, may it please your knighthood," answered
Dwining, gently."I will carry him off from the very foot of the gallows
into the land of faery, like King Arthur, or Sir Huon of Bordeaux, or
Ugero the Dane; or I will, if I please, suffer him to dangle on the
gibbet for a certain number of minutes, or hours, and then whisk him
away from the sight of all, with as much ease as the wind wafts away the
withered leaf.""This is idle boasting, sir leech," replied Ramorny."The whole mob of
Perth will attend him to the gallows, each more eager than another to
see the retainer of a nobleman die, for the slaughter of a cuckoldly
citizen.There will be a thousand of them round the gibbet's foot.""And were there ten thousand," said Dwining, "shall I, who am a high
clerk, and have studied in Spain, and Araby itself, not be able to
deceive the eyes of this hoggish herd of citizens, when the pettiest
juggler that ever dealt in legerdemain can gull even the sharp
observation of your most intelligent knighthood?I tell you, I will put
the change on them as if I were in possession of Keddie's ring.""If thou speakest truth," answered the knight, "and I think thou darest
not palter with me on such a theme, thou must have the aid of Satan, and
I will have nought to do with him.Dwining indulged in his internal chuckling laugh when he heard his
patron testify his defiance of the foul fiend, and saw him second it by
crossing himself.He composed himself, however, upon observing Ramorny's
aspect become very stern, and said, with tolerable gravity, though a
little interrupted by the effort necessary to suppress his mirthful
mood:

"Confederacy, most devout sir--confederacy is the soul of jugglery.But--he, he, he!--I have not the honour to be--he, he!--an ally of the
gentleman of whom you speak--in whose existence I am--he, he!--no
very profound believer, though your knightship, doubtless, hath better
opportunities of acquaintance.""Proceed, rascal, and without that sneer, which thou mayst otherwise
dearly pay for.""I will, most undaunted," replied Dwining."Know that I have my
confederate too, else my skill were little worth.""And who may that be, pray you?""Stephen Smotherwell, if it like your honour, lockman of this Fair City.I marvel your knighthood knows him not.""And I marvel thy knaveship knows him not on professional acquaintance,"
replied Ramorny; "but I see thy nose is unslit, thy ears yet uncropped,
and if thy shoulders are scarred or branded, thou art wise for using a
high collared jerkin."your honour is pleasant," said the mediciner."It is not by
personal circumstances that I have acquired the intimacy of Stephen
Smotherwell, but on account of a certain traffic betwixt us, in which
an't please you, I exchange certain sums of silver for the bodies,
heads, and limbs of those who die by aid of friend Stephen."exclaimed the knight with horror, "is it to compose charms and
forward works of witchcraft that you trade for these miserable relics of
mortality?"No, an it please your knighthood," answered the mediciner,
much amused with the ignorance of his patron; "but we, who are knights
of the scalpel, are accustomed to practise careful carving of the limbs
of defunct persons, which we call dissection, whereby we discover, by
examination of a dead member, how to deal with one belonging to a living
man, which hath become diseased through injury or otherwise.if your
honour saw my poor laboratory, I could show you heads and hands, feet
and lungs, which have been long supposed to be rotting in the mould.The skull of Wallace, stolen from London Bridge; the head of Sir
Simon Fraser [the famous ancestor of the Lovats, slain at Halidon Hill
(executed in London in 1306)], that never feared man; the lovely skull
of the fair Katie Logie [(should be Margaret Logie), the beautiful
mistress of David II].Oh, had I but had the fortune to have preserved
the chivalrous hand of mine honoured patron!"Thinkest thou to disgust me with thy catalogue of
horrors?How can thy traffic
with the hangdog executioner be of avail to serve me, or to help my
servant Bonthron?""Nay, I do not recommend it to your knighthood, save in an extremity,"
replied Dwining."But we will suppose the battle fought and our cock
beaten.Now we must first possess him with the certainty that, if unable
to gain the day, we will at least save him from the hangman, provided he
confess nothing which can prejudice your knighthood's honour."ay, a thought strikes me," said Ramorny."We can do more than this,
we can place a word in Bonthron's mouth that will be troublesome enough
to him whom I am bound to curse for being the cause of my misfortune.Let us to the ban dog's kennel, and explain to him what is to be done
in every view of the question.If we can persuade him to stand the bier
ordeal, it may be a mere bugbear, and in that case we are safe.If he
take the combat, he is fierce as a baited bear, and may, perchance,
master his opponent; then we are more than safe, we are avenged.If
Bonthron himself is vanquished, we will put thy device in exercise; and
if thou canst manage it cleanly; we may dictate his confession, take the
advantage of it, as I will show thee on further conference, and make a
giant stride towards satisfaction for my wrongs.Suppose our mastiff mortally wounded in the lists, who shall
prevent his growling out some species of confession different from what
we would recommend?""Marry, that can his mediciner," said Dwining."Let me wait on him, and
have the opportunity to lay but a finger on his wound, and trust me he
shall betray no confidence.""Why, there's a willing fiend, that needs neither pushing nor
prompting!""As I trust I shall need neither in your knighthood's service.""We will go indoctrinate our agent," continued the knight."We shall
find him pliant; for, hound as he is, he knows those who feed from those
who browbeat him; and he holds a late royal master of mine in deep hate
for some injurious treatment and base terms which he received at his
hand.I must also farther concert with thee the particulars of
thy practice, for saving the ban dog from the hands of the herd of
citizens."We leave this worthy pair of friends to their secret practices, of which
we shall afterwards see the results.They were, although of different
qualities, as well matched for device and execution of criminal projects
as the greyhound is to destroy the game which the slowhound raises, or
the slowhound to track the prey which the gazehound discovers by the
eye.Pride and selfishness were the characteristics of both; but, from
the difference of rank, education, and talents, they had assumed the
most different appearance in the two individuals.Nothing could less resemble the high blown ambition of the favourite
courtier, the successful gallant, and the bold warrior than the
submissive, unassuming mediciner, who seemed even to court and delight
in insult; whilst, in his secret soul, he felt himself possessed of a
superiority of knowledge, a power both of science and of mind, which
placed the rude nobles of the day infinitely beneath him.So conscious
was Henbane Dwining of this elevation, that, like a keeper of wild
beasts, he sometimes adventured, for his own amusement, to rouse the
stormy passions of such men as Ramorny, trusting, with his humble
manner, to elude the turmoil he had excited, as an Indian boy will
launch his light canoe, secure from its very fragility, upon a broken
surf, in which the boat of an argosy would be assuredly dashed to
pieces.That the feudal baron should despise the humble practitioner
in medicine was a matter of course; but Ramorny felt not the less the
influence which Dwining exercised over him, and was in the encounter
of their wits often mastered by him, as the most eccentric efforts of
a fiery horse are overcome by a boy of twelve years old, if he has been
bred to the arts of the manege.But the contempt of Dwining for Ramorny
was far less qualified.He regarded the knight, in comparison with
himself, as scarcely rising above the brute creation; capable, indeed,
of working destruction, as the bull with his horns or the wolf with his
fangs, but mastered by mean prejudices, and a slave to priest craft, in
which phrase Dwining included religion of every kind.On the whole, he
considered Ramorny as one whom nature had assigned to him as a serf, to
mine for the gold which he worshipped, and the avaricious love of
which was his greatest failing, though by no means his worst vice.He
vindicated this sordid tendency in his own eyes by persuading himself
that it had its source in the love of power."Henbane Dwining," he said, as he gazed in delight upon the hoards which
he had secretly amassed, and which he visited from time to time, "is no
silly miser that doats on those pieces for their golden lustre: it is
the power with which they endow the possessor which makes him thus adore
them.What is there that these put not within your command?Do you love
beauty, and are mean, deformed, infirm, and old?Here is a lure the
fairest hawk of them all will stoop to.Are you feeble, weak, subject
to the oppression of the powerful?Here is that will arm in your defence
those more mighty than the petty tyrant whom you fear.Are you splendid
in your wishes, and desire the outward show of opulence?This dark chest
contains many a wide range of hill and dale, many a fair forest full
of game, the allegiance of a thousand vassals.Wish you for favour in
courts, temporal or spiritual?The smiles of kings, the pardon of popes
and priests for old crimes, and the indulgence which encourages priest
ridden fools to venture on new ones--all these holy incentives to vice
may be purchased for gold.Revenge itself, which the gods are said to
reserve to themselves, doubtless because they envy humanity so sweet a
morsel--revenge itself is to be bought by it.But it is also to be won
by superior skill, and that is the nobler mode of reaching it.I will
spare, then, my treasure for other uses, and accomplish my revenge
gratis; or rather I will add the luxury of augmented wealth to the
triumph of requited wrongs."Thus thought Dwining, as, returned from his visit to Sir John Ramorny,
he added the gold he had received for his various services to the mass
of his treasure; and, having gloated over the whole for a minute or two,
turned the key on his concealed treasure house, and walked forth on his
visits to his patients, yielding the wall to every man whom he met and
bowing and doffing his bonnet to the poorest burgher that owned a petty
booth, nay, to the artificers who gained their precarious bread by the
labour of their welked hands."Caitiffs," was the thought of his heart while he did such
obeisance--"base, sodden witted mechanics!did you know what this
key could disclose, what foul weather from heaven would prevent your
unbonneting?what putrid kennel in your wretched hamlet would be
disgusting enough to make you scruple to fall down and worship the owner
of such wealth?But I will make you feel my power, though it suits my
honour to hide the source of it.I will be an incubus to your city,
since you have rejected me as a magistrate.Like the night mare, I will
hag ride ye, yet remain invisible myself.This miserable Ramorny, too,
he who, in losing his hand, has, like a poor artisan, lost the only
valuable part of his frame, he heaps insulting language on me, as if
anything which he can say had power to chafe a constant mind like mine!Yet, while he calls me rogue, villain, and slave, he acts as wisely as
if he should amuse himself by pulling hairs out of my head while my hand
had hold of his heart strings.Every insult I can pay back instantly
by a pang of bodily pain or mental agony, and--he, he!--I run no long
accounts with his knighthood, that must be allowed."While the mediciner was thus indulging his diabolical musing, and
passing, in his creeping manner, along the street, the cry of females
was heard behind him."Ay, there he is, Our Lady be praised!--there is the most helpful man in
Perth," said one voice."They may speak of knights and kings for redressing wrongs, as they
call it; but give me worthy Master Dwining the potter carrier, cummers,"
replied another.At the same moment, the leech was surrounded and taken hold of by the
speakers, good women of the Fair City.said Dwining, "whose cow has calved?""There is no calving in the case," said one of the women, "but a poor
fatherless wean dying; so come awa' wi' you, for our trust is constant
in you, as Bruce said to Donald of the Isles.""Opiferque per orbem dicor," said Henbane Dwining."What is the child
dying of?""The croup--the croup," screamed one of the gossips; "the innocent is
rouping like a corbie.""Cynanche trachealis--that disease makes brief work.Show me the house
instantly," continued the mediciner, who was in the habit of exercising
his profession liberally, not withstanding his natural avarice, and
humanely, in spite of his natural malignity.As we can suspect him of no
better principle, his motive most probably may have been vanity and the
love of his art.He would nevertheless have declined giving his attendance in the present
case had he known whither the kind gossips were conducting him, in time
sufficient to frame an apology.But, ere he guessed where he was going,
the leech was hurried into the house of the late Oliver Proudfute, from
which he heard the chant of the women as they swathed and dressed the
corpse of the umquhile bonnet maker for the ceremony of next morning, of
which chant the following verses may be received as a modern imitation:

     Viewless essence, thin and bare,
     Well nigh melted into air,
     Still with fondness hovering near
     The earthly form thou once didst wear,

     Pause upon thy pinion's flight;
     Be thy course to left or right,
     Be thou doom'd to soar or sink,
     Pause upon the awful brink.To avenge the deed expelling
     Thee untimely from thy dwelling,
     Mystic force thou shalt retain
     O'er the blood and o'er the brain.When the form thou shalt espy
     That darken'd on thy closing eye,
     When the footstep thou shalt hear
     That thrill'd upon thy dying ear,

     Then strange sympathies shall wake,
     The flesh shall thrill, the nerves shall quake,
     The wounds renew their clotter'd flood,
     And every drop cry blood for blood!Hardened as he was, the physician felt reluctance to pass the threshold
of the man to whose death he had been so directly, though, so far as the
individual was concerned, mistakingly, accessory."Let me pass on, women," he said, "my art can only help the living--the
dead are past our power.""Nay, but your patient is upstairs--the youngest orphan"--Dwining was
compelled to go into the house.But he was surprised when, the instant
he stepped over the threshold, the gossips, who were busied with the
dead body, stinted suddenly in their song, while one said to the others:

"In God's name, who entered?"Not so," said another voice, "it is a drop of the liquid balm.""Nay, cummer, it was blood.Again I say, who entered the house even
now?"One looked out from the apartment into the little entrance, where
Dwining, under pretence of not distinctly seeing the trap ladder by
which he was to ascend into the upper part of this house of lamentation,
was delaying his progress purposely, disconcerted with what had reached
him of the conversation."Nay, it is only worthy Master Henbane Dwining," answered one of the
sibyls."Only Master Dwining," replied the one who had first spoken, in a tone
of acquiescence--"our best helper in need!Then it must have been balm
sure enough.""Nay," said the other, "it may have been blood nevertheless; for
the leech, look you, when the body was found, was commanded by the
magistrates to probe the wound with his instruments, and how could the
poor dead corpse know that that was done with good purpose?""Ay, truly, cummer; and as poor Oliver often mistook friends for enemies
while he was in life, his judgment cannot be thought to have mended
now."Dwining heard no more, being now forced upstairs into a species of
garret, where Magdalen sat on her widowed bed, clasping to her bosom
her infant, which, already black in the face and uttering the gasping,
crowing sound which gives the popular name to the complaint, seemed on
the point of rendering up its brief existence.A Dominican monk sat near
the bed, holding the other child in his arms, and seeming from time to
time to speak a word or two of spiritual consolation, or intermingle
some observation on the child's disorder.The mediciner cast upon the good father a single glance, filled
With that ineffable disdain which men of science entertain against
interlopers.His own aid was instant and efficacious: he snatched the
child from the despairing mother, stripped its throat, and opened
a vein, which, as it bled freely, relieved the little patient
instantaneously.In a brief space every dangerous symptom disappeared,
and Dwining, having bound up the vein, replaced the infant in the arms
of the half distracted mother.The poor woman's distress for her husband's loss, which had been
suspended during the extremity of the child's danger, now returned on
Magdalen with the force of an augmented torrent, which has borne down
the dam dike that for a while interrupted its waves."Oh, learned sir," she said, "you see a poor woman of her that you once
knew a richer.But the hands that restored this bairn to my arms must
not leave this house empty.Generous, kind Master Dwining, accept of
his beads; they are made of ebony and silver.He aye liked to have his
things as handsome as any gentleman, and liker he was in all his ways to
a gentleman than any one of his standing, and even so came of it."With these words, in a mute passion of grief she pressed to her breast
and to her lips the chaplet of her deceased husband, and proceeded to
thrust it into Dwining's hands."Take it," she said, "for the love of one who loved you well.Ah, he
used ever to say, if ever man could be brought back from the brink of
the grave, it must be by Master Dwining's guidance.And his ain bairn
is brought back this blessed day, and he is lying there stark and stiff,
and kens naething of its health and sickness!Oh, woe is me, and walawa!But take the beads, and think on his puir soul, as you put them through
your fingers, he will be freed from purgatory the sooner that good
people pray to assoilzie him.""Take back your beads, cummer; I know no legerdemain, can do no
conjuring tricks," said the mediciner, who, more moved than perhaps his
rugged nature had anticipated, endeavoured to avoid receiving the ill
omened gift.But his last words gave offence to the churchman, whose
presence he had not recollected when he uttered them.said the Dominican, "do you call prayers for the
dead juggling tricks?I know that Chaucer, the English maker, says of
you mediciners, that your study is but little on the Bible.Our mother,
the church, hath nodded of late, but her eyes are now opened to discern
friends from foes; and be well assured--"

"Nay, reverend father," said Dwining, "you take me at too great
advantage.I said I could do no miracles, and was about to add that,
as the church certainly could work such conclusions, those rich beads
should be deposited in your hands, to be applied as they may best
benefit the soul of the deceased."He dropped the beads into the Dominican's hand, and escaped from the
house of mourning."This was a strangely timed visit," he said to himself, when he got safe
out of doors."I hold such things cheap as any can; yet, though it is
but a silly fancy, I am glad I saved the squalling child's life.But
I must to my friend Smotherwell, whom I have no doubt to bring to my
purpose in the matter of Bonthron; and thus on this occasion I shall
save two lives, and have destroyed only one."where he lies embalmed in gore,
     His wound to Heaven cries:
     The floodgates of his blood implore
     For vengeance from the skies.John in Perth, being that of the patron saint
of the burgh, had been selected by the magistrates as that in which
the community was likely to have most fair play for the display of the
ordeal.The churches and convents of the Dominicans, Carthusians, and
others of the regular clergy had been highly endowed by the King and
nobles, and therefore it was the universal cry of the city council
that "their ain good auld St.John," of whose good graces they thought
themselves sure, ought to be fully confided in, and preferred to the new
patrons, for whom the Dominicans, Carthusians, Carmelites, and others
had founded newer seats around the Fair City.The disputes between the
regular and secular clergy added to the jealousy which dictated this
choice of the spot in which Heaven was to display a species of miracle,
upon a direct appeal to the divine decision in a case of doubtful guilt;
and the town clerk was as anxious that the church of St.John should be
preferred as if there had been a faction in the body of saints for and
against the interests of the beautiful town of Perth.Many, therefore, were the petty intrigues entered into and disconcerted
for the purpose of fixing on the church.But the magistrates,
considering it as a matter touching in a close degree the honour of
the city, determined, with judicious confidence in the justice and
impartiality of their patron, to confide the issue to the influence of
St.It was, therefore, after high mass had been performed with the greatest
solemnity of which circumstances rendered the ceremony capable, and
after the most repeated and fervent prayers had been offered to Heaven
by the crowded assembly, that preparations were made for appealing
to the direct judgment of Heaven on the mysterious murder of the
unfortunate bonnet maker.The scene presented that effect of imposing solemnity which the rites
of the Catholic Church are so well qualified to produce.The eastern
window, richly and variously painted, streamed down a torrent of
chequered light upon the high altar.On the bier placed before it were
stretched the mortal remains of the murdered man, his arms folded on his
breast, and his palms joined together, with the fingers pointed upwards,
as if the senseless clay was itself appealing to Heaven for vengeance
against those who had violently divorced the immortal spirit from its
mangled tenement.Close to the bier was placed the throne which supported Robert of
Scotland and his brother Albany.The Prince sat upon a lower stool,
beside his father--an arrangement which occasioned some observation, as,
Albany's seat being little distinguished from that of the King, the heir
apparent, though of full age, seemed to be degraded beneath his uncle in
the sight of the assembled people of Perth.The bier was so placed as to
leave the view of the body it sustained open to the greater part of the
multitude assembled in the church.At the head of the bier stood the Knight of Kinfauns, the challenger,
and at the foot the young Earl of Crawford, as representing the
defendant.The evidence of the Duke of Rothsay in expurgation, as it
was termed, of Sir John Ramorny, had exempted him from the necessity of
attendance as a party subjected to the ordeal; and his illness served as
a reason for his remaining at home.His household, including those who,
though immediately in waiting upon Sir John, were accounted the Prince's
domestics, and had not yet received their dismissal, amounted to eight
or ten persons, most of them esteemed men of profligate habits, and who
might therefore be deemed capable, in the riot of a festival evening,
of committing the slaughter of the bonnet maker.They were drawn up in a
row on the left side of the church, and wore a species of white cassock,
resembling the dress of a penitentiary.All eyes being bent on them,
several of this band seemed so much disconcerted as to excite among the
spectators strong prepossessions of their guilt.The real murderer had
a countenance incapable of betraying him--a sullen, dark look, which
neither the feast nor wine cup could enliven, and which the peril of
discovery and death could not render dejected.We have already noticed the posture of the dead body.The face was bare,
as were the breast and arms.The rest of the corpse was shrouded in a
winding sheet of the finest linen, so that, if blood should flow from
any place which was covered, it could not fail to be instantly manifest.High mass having been performed, followed by a solemn invocation to the
Deity, that He would be pleased to protect the innocent, and make known
the guilty, Eviot, Sir John Ramorny's page, was summoned to undergo the
ordeal.Perhaps he thought his
internal consciousness that Bonthron must have been the assassin might
be sufficient to implicate him in the murder, though he was not directly
accessory to it.He paused before the bier; and his voice faltered,
as he swore by all that was created in seven days and seven nights, by
heaven, by hell, by his part of paradise, and by the God and author
of all, that he was free and sackless of the bloody deed done upon the
corpse before which he stood, and on whose breast he made the sign of
the cross, in evidence of the appeal.The body
remained stiff as before, the curdled wounds gave no sign of blood.The citizens looked on each other with faces of blank disappointment.They had persuaded themselves of Eviot's guilt, and their suspicions had
been confirmed by his irresolute manner.Their surprise at his escape
was therefore extreme.The other followers of Ramorny took heart, and
advanced to take the oath with a boldness which increased as one by
one they performed the ordeal, and were declared, by the voice of
the judges, free and innocent of every suspicion attaching to them on
account of the death of Oliver Proudfute.But there was one individual who did not partake that increasing
confidence.The name of "Bonthron--Bonthron!"sounded three times
through the aisles of the church; but he who owned it acknowledged the
call no otherwise than by a sort of shuffling motion with his feet, as
if he had been suddenly affected with a fit of the palsy."Speak, dog," whispered Eviot, "or prepare for a dog's death!"But the murderer's brain was so much disturbed by the sight before him,
that the judges, beholding his deportment, doubted whether to ordain him
to be dragged before the bier or to pronounce judgment in default; and
it was not until he was asked for the last time whether he would submit
to the ordeal, that he answered, with his usual brevity:

"I will not; what do I know what juggling tricks may be practised to
take a poor man's life?I offer the combat to any man who says I harmed
that dead body."And, according to usual form, he threw his glove upon the floor of the
church.Henry Smith stepped forward, amidst the murmured applauses of his fellow
citizens, which even the august presence could not entirely suppress;
and, lifting the ruffian's glove, which he placed in his bonnet, laid
down his own in the usual form, as a gage of battle."He is no match for me," growled the savage, "nor fit to lift my glove.I follow the Prince of Scotland, in attending on his master of horse."Thou follow me, caitiff!I discharge
thee from my service on the spot.Take him in hand, Smith, and beat
him as thou didst never thump anvil!The villain is both guilty and
recreant.It sickens me even to look at him; and if my royal father will
be ruled by me, he will give the parties two handsome Scottish axes, and
we will see which of them turns out the best fellow before the day is
half an hour older."This was readily assented to by the Earl of Crawford and Sir Patrick
Charteris, the godfathers of the parties, who, as the combatants were
men of inferior rank, agreed that they should fight in steel caps, buff
jackets, and with axes, and that as soon as they could be prepared for
the combat.The lists were appointed in the Skinners' Yards--a neighbouring space of
ground, occupied by the corporation from which it had the name, and
who quickly cleared a space of about thirty feet by twenty-five for
the combatants.Thither thronged the nobles, priests, and commons--all
excepting the old King, who, detesting such scenes of blood, retired
to his residence, and devolved the charge of the field upon the Earl
of Errol, Lord High Constable, to whose office it more particularly
belonged.The Duke of Albany watched the whole proceeding with a close
and wary eye.His nephew gave the scene the heedless degree of notice
which corresponded with his character.When the combatants appeared in the lists, nothing could be more
striking than the contrast betwixt the manly, cheerful countenance of
the smith, whose sparkling bright eye seemed already beaming with the
victory he hoped for, and the sullen, downcast aspect of the brutal
Bonthron, who looked as if he were some obscene bird, driven into
sunshine out of the shelter of its darksome haunts.They made oath
severally, each to the truth of his quarrel--a ceremony which Henry
Gow performed with serene and manly confidence, Bonthron with a dogged
resolution, which induced the Duke of Rothsay to say to the High
Constable: "Didst thou ever, my dear Errol, behold such a mixture of
malignity, cruelty, and I think fear, as in that fellow's countenance?""He is not comely," said the Earl, "but a powerful knave as I have
seen.""I'll gage a hogshead of wine with you, my good lord, that he loses the
day.Henry the armourer is as strong as he, and much more active; and
then look at his bold bearing!There is something in that other fellow
that is loathsome to look upon.Let them yoke presently, my dear
Constable, for I am sick of beholding him."The High Constable then addressed the widow, who, in her deep weeds, and
having her children still beside her, occupied a chair within the lists:
"Woman, do you willingly accept of this man, Henry the Smith, to do
battle as your champion in this cause?""I do--I do, most willingly," answered Magdalen Proudfute; "and may the
blessing of God and St.John give him strength and fortune, since he
strikes for the orphan and fatherless!""Then I pronounce this a fenced field of battle," said the Constable
aloud."Let no one dare, upon peril of his life, to interrupt this
combat by word, speech, or look.The trumpets flourished, and the combatants, advancing from the opposite
ends of the lists, with a steady and even pace, looked at each other
attentively, well skilled in judging from the motion of the eye the
direction in which a blow was meditated.They halted opposite to, and
within reach of, each other, and in turn made more than one feint
to strike, in order to ascertain the activity and vigilance of the
opponent.At length, whether weary of these manoeuvres, or fearing lest
in a contest so conducted his unwieldy strength would be foiled by the
activity of the smith, Bonthron heaved up his axe for a downright blow,
adding the whole strength of his sturdy arms to the weight of the weapon
in its descent.The smith, however, avoided the stroke by stepping
aside; for it was too forcible to be controlled by any guard which he
could have interposed.Ere Bonthron recovered guard, Henry struck him
a sidelong blow on the steel headpiece, which prostrated him on the
ground."Confess, or die," said the victor, placing his foot on the body of
the vanquished, and holding to his throat the point of the axe, which
terminated in a spike or poniard."I will confess," said the villain, glaring wildly upwards on the sky."Not till you have yielded," said Harry Smith."I do yield," again murmured Bonthron, and Henry proclaimed aloud that
his antagonist was defeated.The Dukes of Rothsay and Albany, the High Constable, and the Dominican
prior now entered the lists, and, addressing Bonthron, demanded if he
acknowledged himself vanquished."I do," answered the miscreant."And guilty of the murder of Oliver Proudfute?""I am; but I mistook him for another.""And whom didst thou intend to slay?""Confess, my son,
and merit thy pardon in another world for with this thou hast little
more to do.""I took the slain man," answered the discomfited combatant, "for him
whose hand has struck me down, whose foot now presses me."said the prior; "now all those who doubt the
virtue of the holy ordeal may have their eyes opened to their error.Lo,
he is trapped in the snare which he laid for the guiltless.""I scarce ever saw the man," said the smith."I never did wrong to him
or his.Ask him, an it please your reverence, why he should have thought
of slaying me treacherously.""It is a fitting question," answered the prior."Give glory where it is
due, my son, even though it is manifested by thy shame.For what reason
wouldst thou have waylaid this armourer, who says he never wronged
thee?""He had wronged him whom I served," answered Bonthron, "and I meditated
the deed by his command."Bonthron was silent for an instant, then growled out: "He is too mighty
for me to name.""Hearken, my son," said the churchman; "tarry but a brief hour, and the
mighty and the mean of this earth shall to thee alike be empty sounds.The sledge is even now preparing to drag thee to the place of execution.Therefore, son, once more I charge thee to consult thy soul's weal by
glorifying Heaven, and speaking the truth.Was it thy master, Sir John
Ramorny, that stirred thee to so foul a deed?""No," answered the prostrate villain, "it was a greater than he."And at
the same time he pointed with his finger to the Prince.said the astonished Duke of Rothsay; "do you dare to hint that
I was your instigator?""You yourself, my lord," answered the unblushing ruffian."Die in thy falsehood, accursed slave!"said the Prince; and, drawing
his sword, he would have pierced his calumniator, had not the Lord High
Constable interposed with word and action."Your Grace must forgive my discharging mine office: this caitiff must
be delivered into the hands of the executioner.He is unfit to be dealt
with by any other, much less by your Highness."noble earl," said Albany aloud, and with much real or affected
emotion, "would you let the dog pass alive from hence, to poison the
people's ears with false accusations against the Prince of Scotland?I
say, cut him to mammocks upon the spot!""Your Highness will pardon me," said the Earl of Errol; "I must protect
him till his doom is executed.""Then let him be gagged instantly," said Albany."And you, my royal
nephew, why stand you there fixed in astonishment?Call your resolution
up--speak to the prisoner--swear--protest by all that is sacred that you
knew not of this felon deed.See how the people look on each other and
whisper apart!My life on't that this lie spreads faster than any Gospel
truth.Speak to them, royal kinsman, no matter what you say, so you be
constant in denial.""What, sir," said Rothsay, starting from his pause of surprise and
mortification, and turning haughtily towards his uncle; "would you have
me gage my royal word against that of an abject recreant?Let those who
can believe the son of their sovereign, the descendant of Bruce, capable
of laying ambush for the life of a poor mechanic, enjoy the pleasure of
thinking the villain's tale true.""That will not I for one," said the smith, bluntly."I never did aught
but what was in honour towards his royal Grace the Duke of Rothsay, and
never received unkindness from him in word, look, or deed; and I cannot
think he would have given aim to such base practice.""Was it in honour that you threw his Highness from the ladder in Curfew
Street upon Fastern's [St.said Bonthron; "or think
you the favour was received kindly or unkindly?"This was so boldly said, and seemed so plausible, that it shook the
smith's opinion of the Prince's innocence."Alas, my lord," said he, looking sorrowfully towards Rothsay, "could
your Highness seek an innocent fellow's life for doing his duty by a
helpless maiden?I would rather have died in these lists than live to
hear it said of the Bruce's heir!""Thou art a good fellow, Smith," said the Prince; "but I cannot expect
thee to judge more wisely than others.Away with that convict to the
gallows, and gibbet him alive an you will, that he may speak falsehood
and spread scandal on us to the last prolonged moment of his existence!"So saying, the Prince turned away from the lists, disdaining to notice
the gloomy looks cast towards him, as the crowd made slow and reluctant
way for him to pass, and expressing neither surprise nor displeasure at
a deep, hollow murmur, or groan, which accompanied his retreat.Only a
few of his own immediate followers attended him from the field, though
various persons of distinction had come there in his train.Even the
lower class of citizens ceased to follow the unhappy Prince, whose
former indifferent reputation had exposed him to so many charges of
impropriety and levity, and around whom there seemed now darkening
suspicions of the most atrocious nature.He took his slow and thoughtful way to the church of the Dominicans; but
the ill news, which flies proverbially fast, had reached his father's
place of retirement before he himself appeared.On entering the palace
and inquiring for the King, the Duke of Rothsay was surprised to be
informed that he was in deep consultation with the Duke of Albany, who,
mounting on horseback as the Prince left the lists, had reached the
convent before him.He was about to use the privilege of his rank and
birth to enter the royal apartment, when MacLouis, the commander of
the guard of Brandanes, gave him to understand, in the most respectful
terms, that he had special instructions which forbade his admittance."Go at least, MacLouis, and let them know that I wait their pleasure,"
said the Prince."If my uncle desires to have the credit of shutting the
father's apartment against the son, it will gratify him to know that I
am attending in the outer hall like a lackey.""May it please you," said MacLouis, with hesitation, "if your Highness
would consent to retire just now, and to wait awhile in patience, I will
send to acquaint you when the Duke of Albany goes; and I doubt not that
his Majesty will then admit your Grace to his presence.At present, your
Highness must forgive me, it is impossible you can have access.""I understand you, MacLouis; but go, nevertheless, and obey my
commands."The officer went accordingly, and returned with a message that the King
was indisposed, and on the point of retiring to his private chamber;
but that the Duke of Albany would presently wait upon the Prince of
Scotland.It was, however, a full half hour ere the Duke of Albany appeared--a
period of time which Rothsay spent partly in moody silence, and
partly in idle talk with MacLouis and the Brandanes, as the levity or
irritability of his temper obtained the ascendant.At length the Duke came, and with him the lord High Constable, whose
countenance expressed much sorrow and embarrassment."Fair kinsman," said the Duke of Albany, "I grieve to say that it is
my royal brother's opinion that it will be best, for the honour of the
royal family, that your Royal Highness do restrict yourself for a time
to the seclusion of the High Constable's lodgings, and accept of the
noble Earl here present for your principal, if not sole, companion until
the scandals which have been this day spread abroad shall be refuted or
forgotten.""How is this, my lord of Errol?""Is
your house to be my jail, and is your lordship to be my jailer?""The saints forbid, my lord," said the Earl of Errol "but it is my
unhappy duty to obey the commands of your father, by considering your
Royal Highness for some time as being under my ward.""The Prince--the heir of Scotland, under the ward of the High Constable!is the blighting speech of
a convicted recreant of strength sufficient to tarnish my royal
escutcheon?""While such accusations are not refuted and denied, my kinsman," said
the Duke of Albany, "they will contaminate that of a monarch."exclaimed the Prince; "by whom are they asserted,
save by a wretch too infamous, even by his own confession, to be
credited for a moment, though a beggar's character, not a prince's, were
impeached?Fetch him hither, let the rack be shown to him; you will soon
hear him retract the calumny which he dared to assert!""The gibbet has done its work too surely to leave Bonthron sensible
to the rack," said the Duke of Albany."He has been executed an hour
since."said the Prince; "know you it looks as if
there were practice in it to bring a stain on my name?""The custom is universal, the defeated combatant in the ordeal of battle
is instantly transferred from the lists to the gallows.And yet, fair
kinsman," continued the Duke of Albany, "if you had boldly and strongly
denied the imputation, I would have judged right to keep the wretch
alive for further investigation; but as your Highness was silent, I
deemed it best to stifle the scandal in the breath of him that uttered
it."Mary, my lord, but this is too insulting!Do you, my uncle and
kinsman, suppose me guilty of prompting such an useless and unworthy
action as that which the slave confessed?""It is not for me to bandy question with your Highness, otherwise I
would ask whether you also mean to deny the scarce less unworthy, though
less bloody, attack upon the house in Couvrefew Street?Be not angry
with me, kinsman; but, indeed, your sequestering yourself for some brief
space from the court, were it only during the King's residence in this
city, where so much offence has been given, is imperiously demanded."Rothsay paused when he heard this exhortation, and, looking at the Duke
in a very marked manner, replied:

"Uncle, you are a good huntsman.You have pitched your toils with much
skill, but you would have been foiled, not withstanding, had not the
stag rushed among the nets of free will.God speed you, and may you have
the profit by this matter which your measures deserve.Say to my father,
I obey his arrest.My Lord High Constable, I wait only your pleasure to
attend you to your lodgings.Since I am to lie in ward, I could not have
desired a kinder or more courteous warden."The interview between the uncle and nephew being thus concluded, the
Prince retired with the Earl of Errol to his apartments; the citizens
whom they met in the streets passing to the further side when they
observed the Duke of Rothsay, to escape the necessity of saluting
one whom they had been taught to consider as a ferocious as well as
unprincipled libertine.The Constable's lodgings received the owner and
his princely guest, both glad to leave the streets, yet neither feeling
easy in the situation which they occupied with regard to each other
within doors.We must return to the lists after the combat had ceased, and when the
nobles had withdrawn.The crowds were now separated into two distinct
bodies.That which made the smallest in number was at the same time the
most distinguished for respectability, consisting of the better class
of inhabitants of Perth, who were congratulating the successful champion
and each other upon the triumphant conclusion to which they had brought
their feud with the courtiers.The magistrates were so much elated on
the occasion, that they entreated Sir Patrick Charteris's acceptance of
a collation in the town hall.To this Henry, the hero of the day, was of
course invited, or he was rather commanded to attend.He listened to
the summons with great embarrassment, for it may be readily believed
his heart was with Catharine Glover.But the advice of his father Simon
decided him.That veteran citizen had a natural and becoming deference
for the magistracy of the Fair City; he entertained a high estimation
of all honours which flowed from such a source, and thought that his
intended son in law would do wrong not to receive them with gratitude."Thou must not think to absent thyself from such a solemn occasion, son
Henry," was his advice."Sir Patrick Charteris is to be there himself,
and I think it will be a rare occasion for thee to gain his goodwill.It
is like he may order of thee a new suit of harness; and I myself heard
worthy Bailie Craigdallie say there was a talk of furbishing up the
city's armoury.Thou must not neglect the good trade, now that thou
takest on thee an expensive family.""Tush, father Glover," answered the embarrassed victor, "I lack no
custom; and thou knowest there is Catharine, who may wonder at my
absence, and have her ear abused once more by tales of glee maidens and
I wot not what.""Fear not for that," said the glover, "but go, like an obedient burgess,
where thy betters desire to have thee.I do not deny that it will cost
thee some trouble to make thy peace with Catharine about this duel; for
she thinks herself wiser in such matters than king and council, kirk
and canons, provost and bailies.But I will take up the quarrel with
her myself, and will so work for thee, that, though she may receive
thee tomorrow with somewhat of a chiding, it shall melt into tears and
smiles, like an April morning, that begins with a mild shower.Away with
thee, then, my son, and be constant to the time, tomorrow morning after
mass."The smith, though reluctantly, was obliged to defer to the reasoning of
his proposed father in law, and, once determined to accept the honour
destined for him by the fathers of the city, he extricated himself from
the crowd, and hastened home to put on his best apparel; in which he
presently afterwards repaired to the council house, where the ponderous
oak table seemed to bend under the massy dishes of choice Tay salmon
and delicious sea fish from Dundee, being the dainties which the fasting
season permitted, whilst neither wine, ale, nor metheglin were wanting
to wash them down.The waits, or minstrels of the burgh, played during
the repast, and in the intervals of the music one of them recited With
great emphasis a long poetical account of the battle of Blackearnside,
fought by Sir William Wallace and his redoubted captain and friend,
Thomas of Longueville, against the English general Seward--a theme
perfectly familiar to all the guests, who, nevertheless, more tolerant
than their descendants, listened as if it had all the zest of novelty.It was complimentary to the ancestor of the Knight of Kinfauns,
doubtless, and to other Perthshire families, in passages which the
audience applauded vociferously, whilst they pledged each other in
mighty draughts to the memory of the heroes who had fought by the side
of the Champion of Scotland.The health of Henry Wynd was quaffed
with repeated shouts, and the provost announced publicly, that the
magistrates were consulting how they might best invest him with some
distinguished privilege or honorary reward, to show how highly his
fellow citizens valued his courageous exertions."Nay, take it not thus, an it like your worships," said the smith, with
his usual blunt manner, "lest men say that valour must be rare in Perth
when they reward a man for fighting for the right of a forlorn widow.I am sure there are many scores of stout burghers in the town who would
have done this day's dargue as well or better than I. For, in good
sooth, I ought to have cracked yonder fellow's head piece like an
earthen pipkin--ay, and would have done it, too, if it had not been
one which I myself tempered for Sir John Ramorny.But, an the Fair
City think my service of any worth, I will conceive it far more than
acquitted by any aid which you may afford from the common good to the
support of the widow Magdalen and her poor orphans.""That may well be done," said Sir Patrick Charteris, "and yet leave the
Fair City rich enough to pay her debts to Henry Wynd, of which every man
of us is a better judge than him self, who is blinded with an unavailing
nicety, which men call modesty.And if the burgh be too poor for this,
the provost will bear his share.The Rover's golden angels have not all
taken flight yet."The beakers were now circulated, under the name of a cup of comfort to
the widow, and anon flowed around once more to the happy memory of the
murdered Oliver, now so bravely avenged.In short, it was a feast so
jovial that all agreed nothing was wanting to render it perfect but the
presence of the bonnet maker himself, whose calamity had occasioned the
meeting, and who had usually furnished the standing jest at such festive
assemblies.Had his attendance been possible, it was drily observed by
Bailie Craigdallie, he would certainly have claimed the success of the
day, and vouched himself the avenger of his own murder.At the sound of the vesper bell the company broke up, some of the graver
sort going to evening prayers, where, with half shut eyes and shining
countenances, they made a most orthodox and edifying portion of a Lenten
congregation; others to their own homes, to tell over the occurrences of
the fight and feast, for the information of the family circle; and some,
doubtless, to the licensed freedoms of some tavern, the door of which
Lent did not keep so close shut as the forms of the church required.Henry returned to the wynd, warm with the good wine and the applause of
his fellow citizens, and fell asleep to dream of perfect happiness and
Catharine Glover.We have said that, when the combat was decided, the spectators were
divided into two bodies.Of these, when the more respectable portion
attended the victor in joyous procession, much the greater number, or
what might be termed the rabble, waited upon the subdued and sentenced
Bonthron, who was travelling in a different direction, and for a very
opposite purpose.Whatever may be thought of the comparative attractions
of the house of mourning and of feasting under other circumstances,
there can be little doubt which will draw most visitors, when the
question is, whether we would witness miseries which we are not to
share, or festivities of which we are not to partake.Accordingly, the
tumbril in which the criminal was conveyed to execution was attended by
far the greater proportion of the inhabitants of Perth.A friar was seated in the same car with the murderer, to whom he did
not hesitate to repeat, under the seal of confession, the same false
asseveration which he had made upon the place of combat, which charged
the Duke of Rothsay with being director of the ambuscade by which
the unfortunate bonnet maker had suffered.The same falsehood he
disseminated among the crowd, averring, with unblushing effrontery, to
those who were nighest to the car, that he owed his death to his having
been willing to execute the Duke of Rothsay's pleasure.For a time
he repeated these words, sullenly and doggedly, in the manner of one
reciting a task, or a liar who endeavours by reiteration to obtain
a credit for his words which he is internally sensible they do not
deserve.But when he lifted up his eyes, and beheld in the distance the
black outline of a gallows, at least forty feet high, with its ladder
and its fatal cord, rising against the horizon, he became suddenly
silent, and the friar could observe that he trembled very much."Be comforted, my son," said the good priest, "you have confessed
the truth, and received absolution.Your penitence will be accepted
according to your sincerity; and though you have been a man of bloody
hands and cruel heart, yet, by the church's prayers, you shall be in due
time assoilzied from the penal fires of purgatory."These assurances were calculated rather to augment than to diminish
the terrors of the culprit, who was agitated by doubts whether the
mode suggested for his preservation from death would to a certainty be
effectual, and some suspicion whether there was really any purpose of
employing them in his favour, for he knew his master well enough to be
aware of the indifference with which he would sacrifice one who might on
some future occasion be a dangerous evidence against him.His doom, however, was sealed, and there was no escaping from it.They
slowly approached the fatal tree, which was erected on a bank by the
river's side, about half a mile from the walls of the city--a site
chosen that the body of the wretch, which was to remain food for the
carrion crows, might be seen from a distance in every direction.Here the priest delivered Bonthron to the executioner, by whom he was
assisted up the ladder, and to all appearance despatched according to
the usual forms of the law.He seemed to struggle for life for a
minute, but soon after hung still and inanimate.The executioner, after
remaining upon duty for more than half an hour, as if to permit the
last spark of life to be extinguished, announced to the admirers of such
spectacles that the irons for the permanent suspension of the carcass
not having been got ready, the concluding ceremony of disembowelling the
dead body and attaching it finally to the gibbet would be deferred till
the next morning at sunrise.Notwithstanding the early hour which he had named, Master Smotherwell
had a reasonable attendance of rabble at the place of execution, to
see the final proceedings of justice with its victim.But great was the
astonishment and resentment of these amateurs to find that the dead body
had been removed from the gibbet.They were not, however, long at a loss
to guess the cause of its disappearance.Bonthron had been the follower
of a baron whose estates lay in Fife, and was himself a native of that
province.What was more natural than that some of the Fife men, whose
boats were frequently plying on the river, should have clandestinely
removed the body of their countryman from the place of public shame?The
crowd vented their rage against Smotherwell for not completing his
job on the preceding evening; and had not he and his assistant betaken
themselves to a boat, and escaped across the Tay, they would have run
some risk of being pelted to death.The event, however, was too much in
the spirit of the times to be much wondered at.Its real cause we shall
explain in the following chapter.Let gallows gape for dogs, let men go free.Henry V.


The incidents of a narrative of this kind must be adapted to each other,
as the wards of a key must tally accurately with those of the lock to
which it belongs.The reader, however gentle, will not hold himself
obliged to rest satisfied with the mere fact that such and such
occurrences took place, which is, generally speaking, all that in
ordinary life he can know of what is passing around him; but he is
desirous, while reading for amusement, of knowing the interior movements
occasioning the course of events.This is a legitimate and reasonable
curiosity; for every man hath a right to open and examine the mechanism
of his own watch, put together for his proper use, although he is not
permitted to pry into the interior of the timepiece which, for general
information, is displayed on the town steeple.It would be, therefore, uncourteous to leave my readers under any doubt
concerning the agency which removed the assassin Bonthron from the
gallows--an event which some of the Perth citizens ascribed to the foul
fiend himself, while others were content to lay it upon the natural
dislike of Bonthron's countrymen of Fife to see him hanging on the river
side, as a spectacle dishonourable to their province.About midnight succeeding the day when the execution had taken place,
and while the inhabitants of Perth were deeply buried in slumber, three
men muffled in their cloaks, and bearing a dark lantern, descended the
alleys of a garden which led from the house occupied by Sir John Ramorny
to the banks of the Tay, where a small boat lay moored to a landing
place, or little projecting pier.The wind howled in a low and
melancholy manner through the leafless shrubs and bushes; and a pale
moon "waded," as it is termed in Scotland, amongst drifting clouds,
which seemed to threaten rain.The three individuals entered the boat
with great precaution to escape observation.One of them was a tall,
powerful man; another short and bent downwards; the third middle sized,
and apparently younger than his companions, well made, and active.They seated themselves in the
boat and unmoored it from the pier."We must let her drift with the current till we pass the bridge, where
the burghers still keep guard; and you know the proverb, 'A Perth
arrow hath a perfect flight,'" said the most youthful of the party, who
assumed the office of helmsman, and pushed the boat off from the pier;
whilst the others took the oars, which were muffled, and rowed with all
precaution till they attained the middle of the river; they then ceased
their efforts, lay upon their oars, and trusted to the steersman for
keeping her in mid channel.In this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded beneath the stately
Gothic arches of the old bridge, erected by the magnificent patronage
of Robert Bruce in 1329, and carried away by an inundation in 1621.Although they heard the voices of a civic watch, which, since these
disturbances commenced, had been nightly maintained in that important
pass, no challenge was given; and when they were so far down the stream
as to be out of hearing of these guardians of the night, they began to
row, but still with precaution, and to converse, though in a low tone."You have found a new trade, comrade, since I left you," said one of the
rowers to the other."I left you engaged in tending a sick knight, and I
find you employed in purloining a dead body from the gallows.""A living body, so please your squirehood, Master Buncle, or else my
craft hath failed of its purpose.""So I am told, Master Pottercarrier; but, saving your clerkship, unless
you tell me your trick, I will take leave to doubt of its success.""A simple toy, Master Buncle, not likely to please a genius so acute as
that of your valiancie.This suspension of the human
body, which the vulgar call hanging, operates death by apoplexia--that
is, the blood being unable to return to the heart by the compression
of the veins, it rushes to the brain, and the man dies.Also, and as an
additional cause of dissolution, the lungs no longer receive the needful
supply of the vital air, owing to the ligature of the cord around the
thorax; and hence the patient perishes."But how is such a revulsion of blood to
the brain to be prevented, sir mediciner?"said the third person, who
was no other than Ramorny's page, Eviot."Marry, then," replied Dwining, "hang me the patient up in such fashion
that the carotid arteries shall not be compressed, and the blood will
not determine to the brain, and apoplexia will not take place; and
again, if there be no ligature around the thorax, the lungs will be
supplied with air, whether the man be hanging in the middle heaven or
standing on the firm earth.""All this I conceive," said Eviot; "but how these precautions can be
reconciled with the execution of the sentence of hanging is what my dull
brain cannot comprehend."good youth, thy valiancie hath spoiled a fair wit.Hadst thou
studied with me, thou shouldst have learned things more difficult than
this.I get me certain bandages, made of the same
substance with your young valiancie's horse girths, having especial care
that they are of a kind which will not shrink on being strained, since
that would spoil my experiment.One loop of this substance is drawn
under each foot, and returns up either side of the leg to a cincture,
with which it is united; these cinctures are connected by divers straps
down the breast and back, in order to divide the weight.And there are
sundry other conveniences for easing the patient, but the chief is this:
the straps, or ligatures, are attached to a broad steel collar, curving
outwards, and having a hook or two, for the better security of the
halter, which the friendly executioner passes around that part of the
machine, instead of applying it to the bare throat of the patient.Thus, when thrown off from the ladder, the sufferer will find himself
suspended, not by his neck, if it please you, but by the steel circle,
which supports the loops in which his feet are placed, and on which his
weight really rests, diminished a little by similar supports under each
arm.Thus, neither vein nor windpipe being compressed, the man will
breathe as free, and his blood, saving from fright and novelty of
situation, will flow as temperately as your valiancie's when you stand
up in your stirrups to view a field of battle.""By my faith, a quaint and rare device!"pursued the leech, "and well worth being known to such
mounting spirits as your valiancies, since there is no knowing to what
height Sir John Ramorny's pupils may arrive; and if these be such that
it is necessary to descend from them by a rope, you may find my mode of
management more convenient than the common practice.Marry, but you must
be provided with a high collared doublet, to conceal the ring of steel,
and, above all, such a bonus socius as Smother well to adjust the
noose.""Base poison vender," said Eviot, "men of our calling die on the field
of battle.""I will save the lesson, however," replied Buncle, "in case of some
pinching occasion.But what a night the bloody hangdog Bonthron must
have had of it, dancing a pavise in mid air to the music of his own
shackles, as the night wind swings him that way and this!""It were an alms deed to leave him there," said Eviot; "for his descent
from the gibbet will but encourage him to new murders.He knows but two
elements--drunkenness and bloodshed.""Perhaps Sir John Ramorny might have been of your opinion," said
Dwining; "but it would first have been necessary to cut out the rogue's
tongue, lest he had told strange tales from his airy height.And there
are other reasons that it concerns not your valiancies to know.In
truth, I myself have been generous in serving him, for the fellow is
built as strong as Edinburgh Castle, and his anatomy would have matched
any that is in the chirurgical hall of Padua.But tell me, Master
Buncle, what news bring you from the doughty Douglas?""They may tell that know," said Buncle."I am the dull ass that bears
the message, and kens nought of its purport.I carried letters from the Duke of Albany and from Sir John
Ramorny to the Douglas, and he looked black as a northern tempest when
he opened them.I brought them answers from the Earl, at which they
smiled like the sun when the harvest storm is closing over him.Go to
your ephemerides, leech, and conjure the meaning out of that.""Methinks I can do so without much cost of wit," said the chirurgeon;
"but yonder I see in the pale moonlight our dead alive.Should he have
screamed out to any chance passenger, it were a curious interruption
to a night journey to be hailed from the top of such a gallows as that.Hark, methinks I do hear his groans amid the whistling of the wind and
the creaking of the chains.So--fair and softly; make fast the boat
with the grappling, and get out the casket with my matters, we would be
better for a little fire, but the light might bring observation on
us.Come on, my men of valour, march warily, for we are bound for the
gallows foot.Follow with the lantern; I trust the ladder has been left."Sing, three merry men, and three merry men,
     And three merry men are we,
     Thou on the land, and I on the sand,
     And Jack on the gallows tree."As they advanced to the gibbet, they could plainly hear groans, though
uttered in a low tone.Dwining ventured to give a low cough once or
twice, by way of signal; but receiving no answer, "We had best make
haste," said he to his companions, "for our friend must be in extremis,
as he gives no answer to the signal which announces the arrival of help.I will go up the ladder first and cut the
rope.Do you two follow, one after another, and take fast hold of the
body, so that he fall not when the halter is unloosed.Keep sure gripe,
for which the bandages will afford you convenience.Bethink you that,
though he plays an owl's part tonight, he hath no wings, and to fall out
of a halter may be as dangerous as to fall into one."While he spoke thus with sneer and gibe, he ascended the ladder, and
having ascertained that the men at arms who followed him had the body in
their hold, he cut the rope, and then gave his aid to support the almost
lifeless form of the criminal.By a skilful exertion of strength and address, the body of Bonthron was
placed safely on the ground; and the faint yet certain existence of life
having been ascertained, it was thence transported to the river side,
where, shrouded by the bank, the party might be best concealed from
observation, while the leech employed himself in the necessary means of
recalling animation, with which he had taken care to provide himself.For this purpose he first freed the recovered person from his shackles,
which the executioner had left unlocked on purpose, and at the same time
disengaged the complicated envelopes and bandages by which he had been
suspended.It was some time ere Dwining's efforts succeeded; for, in
despite of the skill with which his machine had been constructed, the
straps designed to support the body had stretched so considerably as to
occasion the sense of suffocation becoming extremely overpowering.But
the address of the surgeon triumphed over all obstacles; and, after
sneezing and stretching himself, with one or two brief convulsions,
Bonthron gave decided proofs of reanimation, by arresting the hand
of the operator as it was in the act of dropping strong waters on his
breast and throat, and, directing the bottle which contained them to his
lips, he took, almost perforce, a considerable gulp of the contents."It is spiritual essence double distilled," said the astonished
operator, "and would blister the throat and burn the stomach of any
other man.But this extraordinary beast is so unlike all other human
creatures, that I should not wonder if it brought him to the complete
possession of his faculties."Bonthron seemed to confirm this: he started with a strong convulsion,
sat up, stared around, and indicated some consciousness of existence."Wine--wine," were the first words which he articulated.The leech gave him a draught of medicated wine, mixed with water.He
rejected it, under the dishonourable epithet of "kennel washings," and
again uttered the words, "Wine--wine.""Nay, take it to thee, i' the devil's name," said the leech, "since none
but he can judge of thy constitution."A draught, long and deep enough to have discomposed the intellects of
any other person, was found effectual in recalling those of Bonthron to
a more perfect state; though he betrayed no recollection of where he was
or what had befallen him, and in his brief and sullen manner asked why
he was brought to the river side at this time of night."Another frolic of the wild Prince, for drenching me as he did before.Nails and blood, but I would--"

"Hold thy peace," interrupted Eviot, "and be thankful, I pray you, if
you have any thankfulness in you, that thy body is not crow's meat and
thy soul in a place where water is too scarce to duck thee.""I begin to bethink me," said the ruffian; and raising the flask to his
mouth, which he saluted with a long and hearty kiss, he set the empty
bottle on the earth, dropped his head on his bosom, and seemed to muse
for the purpose of arranging his confused recollections."We can abide the issue of his meditations no longer," said Dwining; "he
will be better after he has slept.you have been riding the air
these some hours; try if the water be not an easier mode of conveyance.I can no more lift this mass than I
could raise in my arms a slaughtered bull.""Stand upright on thine own feet, Bonthron, now we have placed thee upon
them," said Eviot."Every drop of blood tingles in my
veins as if it had pinpoints, and my knees refuse to bear their burden.This is some practice of thine,
thou dog leech!""Ay--ay, so it is, honest Bonthron," said Dwining--"a practice thou
shalt thank me for when thou comest to learn it.In the mean while,
stretch down in the stern of that boat, and let me wrap this cloak about
thee."Assisted into the boat accordingly, Bonthron was deposited there as
conveniently as things admitted of.He answered their attentions with
one or two snorts resembling the grunt of a boar who has got some food
particularly agreeable to him."And now, Buncle," said the chirurgeon, "your valiant squireship
knows your charge.You are to carry this lively cargo by the river to
Newburgh, where you are to dispose of him as you wot of; meantime,
here are his shackles and bandages, the marks of his confinement and
liberation.Bind them up together, and fling them into the deepest pool
you pass over; for, found in your possession, they might tell tales
against us all.This low, light breath of wind from the west will permit
you to use a sail as soon as the light comes in and you are tired of
rowing.Your other valiancie, Master Page Eviot, must be content to
return to Perth with me afoot, for here severs our fair company.Take
with thee the lantern, Buncle, for thou wilt require it more than we,
and see thou send me back my flasket."As the pedestrians returned to Perth, Eviot expressed his belief that
Bonthron's understanding would never recover the shock which terror had
inflicted upon it, and which appeared to him to have disturbed all the
faculties of his mind, and in particular his memory."It is not so, an it please your pagehood," said the leech."Bonthron's
intellect, such as it is, hath a solid character: it Will but vacillate
to and fro like a pendulum which hath been put in motion, and then will
rest in its proper point of gravity.Our memory is, of all our powers of
mind, that which is peculiarly liable to be suspended.Deep intoxication
or sound sleep alike destroy it, and yet it returns when the drunkard
becomes sober or the sleeper is awakened.I knew at Paris a criminal condemned to die by the halter,
who suffered the sentence accordingly, showing no particular degree of
timidity upon the scaffold, and behaving and expressing himself as men
in the same condition are wont to do.Accident did for him what a little
ingenious practice hath done for our amiable friend from whom we but
now parted.He was cut down and given to his friends before life was
extinct, and I had the good fortune to restore him.But, though he
recovered in other particulars, he remembered but little of his trial
and sentence.Of his confession on the morning of his execution--he!(in his usual chuckling manner)--he remembered him not a word.Neither of leaving the prison, nor of his passage to the Greve, where
he suffered, nor of the devout speeches with which he--he!he!--so many good Christians, nor of ascending the
fatal tree, nor of taking the fatal leap, had my revenant the slightest
recollection.'But here we reach the point where we must separate;
for it were unfit, should we meet any of the watch, that we be found
together, and it were also prudent that we enter the city by different
gates.My profession forms an excuse for my going and coming at all
times.Your valiant pagehood will make such explanation as may seem
sufficing.""I shall make my will a sufficient excuse if I am interrogated," said
the haughty young man."Yet I will avoid interruption, if possible.The
moon is quite obscured, and the road as black as a wolf's mouth.""Tut," said the physicianer, "let not your valour care for that: we
shall tread darker paths ere it be long."Without inquiring into the meaning of these evil boding sentences, and
indeed hardly listening to them in the pride and recklessness of his
nature, the page of Ramorny parted from his ingenious and dangerous
companion, and each took his own way.The course of true love never did run smooth.The ominous anxiety of our armourer had not played him false.When the
good glover parted with his intended son in law, after the judicial
combat had been decided, he found what he indeed had expected, that his
fair daughter was in no favourable disposition towards her lover.But
although he perceived that Catharine was cold, restrained, collected,
had cast away the appearance of mortal passion, and listened with a
reserve, implying contempt, to the most splendid description he could
give her of the combat in the Skinners' Yards, he was determined not
to take the least notice of her altered manner, but to speak of her
marriage with his son Henry as a thing which must of course take place.At length, when she began, as on a former occasion, to intimate that her
attachment to the armourer did not exceed the bounds of friendship, that
she was resolved never to marry, that the pretended judicial combat
was a mockery of the divine will, and of human laws, the glover not
unnaturally grew angry."I cannot read thy thoughts, wench; nor can I pretend to guess under
what wicked delusion it is that you kiss a declared lover, suffer him
to kiss you, run to his house when a report is spread of his death, and
fling yourself into his arms when you find him alone [alive].All
this shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her parents in a match
sanctioned by her father; but such tokens of intimacy, bestowed on one
whom a young woman cannot esteem, and is determined not to marry, are
uncomely and unmaidenly.You have already been more bounteous of your
favours to Henry Smith than your mother, whom God assoilzie, ever was to
me before I married her.I tell thee, Catharine, this trifling with the
love of an honest man is what I neither can, will, nor ought to endure.I have given my consent to the match, and I insist it shall take place
without delay, and that you receive Henry Wynd tomorrow, as a man whose
bride you are to be with all despatch.""A power more potent than yours, father, will say no," replied
Catharine."I will risk it; my power is a lawful one, that of a father over a
child, and an erring child," answered her father."God and man allow of
my influence.""Then, may Heaven help us," said Catharine; "for, if you are obstinate
in your purpose, we are all lost.""We can expect no help from Heaven," said the glover, "when we act
with indiscretion.I am clerk enough myself to know that; and that your
causeless resistance to my will is sinful, every priest will inform
you.Ay, and more than that, you have spoken degradingly of the blessed
appeal to God in the combat of ordeal.for the Holy Church
is awakened to watch her sheepfold, and to extirpate heresy by fire and
steel; so much I warn thee of."Catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation; and, with difficulty
compelling herself to assume an appearance of composure, promised her
father that, if he would spare her any farther discussion of the subject
till tomorrow morning, she would then meet him, determined to make a
full discovery of her sentiments.With this promise Simon Glover was obliged to remain contented, though
extremely anxious for the postponed explanation.It could not be levity
or fickleness of character which induced his daughter to act with so
much apparent inconsistency towards the man of his choice, and whom she
had so lately unequivocally owned to be also the man of her own.What
external force there could exist, of a kind powerful enough to change
the resolutions she had so decidedly expressed within twenty-four hours,
was a matter of complete mystery."But I will be as obstinate as she can be," thought the glover, "and she
shall either marry Henry Smith without farther delay or old Simon Glover
will know an excellent reason to the contrary."The subject was not renewed during the evening; but early on the next
morning, just at sun rising, Catharine knelt before the bed in which her
parent still slumbered.Her heart sobbed as if it would burst, and her
tears fell thick upon her father's face.The good old man awoke, looked
up, crossed his child's forehead, and kissed her affectionately."I understand thee, Kate," he said; "thou art come to confession, and, I
trust, art desirous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere.""I need not ask, my father, if you remember the Carthusian monk,
Clement, and his preachings and lessons; at which indeed you assisted so
often, that you cannot be ignorant men called you one of his converts,
and with greater justice termed me so likewise?""I am aware of both," said the old man, raising himself on his elbow;
"but I defy foul fame to show that I ever owned him in any heretical
proposition, though I loved to hear him talk of the corruptions of the
church, the misgovernment of the nobles, and the wild ignorance of
the poor, proving, as it seemed to me, that the sole virtue of our
commonweal, its strength and its estimation, lay among the burgher
craft of the better class, which I received as comfortable doctrine, and
creditable to the town.And if he preached other than right doctrine,
wherefore did his superiors in the Carthusian convent permit it?If the
shepherds turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the flock, they should
not blame the sheep for being worried.""They endured his preaching, nay, they encouraged it," said Catharine,
"while the vices of the laity, the contentions of the nobles, and
the oppression of the poor were the subject of his censure, and they
rejoiced in the crowds who, attracted to the Carthusian church,
forsook those of the other convents.But the hypocrites--for such they
are--joined with the other fraternities in accusing their preacher
Clement, when, passing from censuring the crimes of the state, he
began to display the pride, ignorance, and luxury of the churchmen
themselves--their thirst of power, their usurpation over men's
consciences, and their desire to augment their worldly wealth.""For God's sake, Catharine," said her father, "speak within doors: your
voice rises in tone and your speech in bitterness, your eyes sparkle.It is owing to this zeal in what concerns you no more than others
that malicious persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous name of a
heretic.""You know I speak no more than what is truth," said Catharine, "and
which you yourself have avouched often.""Wouldst
thou have me avouch what might cost me life and limb, land and goods?For a full commission hath been granted for taking and trying heretics,
upon whom is laid the cause of all late tumults and miscarriages;
wherefore, few words are best, wench.I am ever of mind with the old
maker:

"Since word is thrall and thought is free, Keep well thy tongue, I
counsel thee.""The counsel comes too late, father," answered Catharine, sinking down
on a chair by her father's bedside."The words have been spoken and
heard; and it is indited against Simon Glover, burgess in Perth, that he
hath spoken irreverent discourses of the doctrines of Holy Church.""As I live by knife and needle," interrupted Simon, "it is a lie!I
never was so silly as to speak of what I understood not.""And hath slandered the anointed of the church, both regular and
secular," continued Catharine."Nay, I will never deny the truth," said the glover: "an idle word I may
have spoken at the ale bench, or over a pottle pot of wine, or in right
sure company; but else, my tongue is not one to run my head into peril.""So you think, my dearest father; but your slightest language has been
espied, your best meaning phrases have been perverted, and you are in
dittay as a gross railer against church and churchmen, and for holding
discourse against them with loose and profligate persons, such as the
deceased Oliver Proudfute, the smith Henry of the Wynd, and others, set
forth as commending the doctrines of Father Clement, whom they charge
with seven rank heresies, and seek for with staff and spear, to try him
to the death.But that," said Catharine, kneeling, and looking upwards
with the aspect of one of those beauteous saints whom the Catholics have
given to the fine arts--"that they shall never do.He hath escaped from
the net of the fowler; and, I thank Heaven, it was by my means.""Thy means, girl--art thou mad?""I will not deny what I glory in," answered Catharine: "it was by my
means that Conachar was led to come hither with a party of men and carry
off the old man, who is now far beyond the Highland line.""Thou my rash--my unlucky child!"said the glover, "hast dared to aid
the escape of one accused of heresy, and to invite Highlanders in arms
to interfere with the administration of justice within burgh?thou hast offended both against the laws of the church and those of the
realm.What--what would become of us, were this known?""It is known, my dear father," said the maiden, firmly--"known even to
those who will be the most willing avengers of the deed.""This must be some idle notion, Catharine, or some trick of those
cogging priests and nuns; it accords not with thy late cheerful
willingness to wed Henry Smith."dearest father, remember the dismal surprise occasioned by his
reported death, and the joyful amazement at finding him alive; and deem
it not wonder if I permitted myself, under your protection, to say more
than my reflection justified.But then I knew not the worst, and thought
the danger exaggerated.Alas I was yesterday fearfully undeceived, when
the abbess herself came hither, and with her the Dominican.They showed
me the commission, under the broad seal of Scotland, for inquiring into
and punishing heresy; they showed me your name and my own in a list of
suspected persons; and it was with tears--real tears, that the abbess
conjured me to avert a dreadful fate by a speedy retreat into the
cloister, and that the monk pledged his word that you should not be
molested if I complied.""The foul fiend take them both for weeping crocodiles!"replied Catharine, "complaint or anger will little help us; but
you see I have had real cause for this present alarm."my reckless child, where was your
prudence when you ran headlong into such a snare?""Hear me, father," said Catharine; "there is still one mode of safety
held out: it is one which I have often proposed, and for which I have in
vain supplicated your permission.""I understand you--the convent," said her father."But, Catharine, what
abbess or prioress would dare--"

"That I will explain to you, father, and it will also show the
circumstances which have made me seem unsteady of resolution to a
degree which has brought censure upon me from yourself and others.Our
confessor, old Father Francis, whom I chose from the Dominican convent
at your command--"

"Ay, truly," interrupted the glover; "and I so counselled and commanded
thee, in order to take off the report that thy conscience was altogether
under the direction of Father Clement.""Well, this Father Francis has at different times urged and provoked me
to converse on such matters as he judged I was likely to learn something
of from the Carthusian preacher.I fell
into the snare, spoke freely, and, as he argued gently, as one who would
fain be convinced, I even spoke warmly in defence of what I believed
devoutly.The confessor assumed not his real aspect and betrayed not his
secret purpose until he had learned all that I had to tell him.It was
then that he threatened me with temporal punishment and with eternal
condemnation.Had his threats reached me alone, I could have stood firm;
for their cruelty on earth I could have endured, and their power beyond
this life I have no belief in."said the glover, who was well nigh beside himself
at perceiving at every new word the increasing extremity of his
daughter's danger, "beware of blaspheming the Holy Church, whose arms
are as prompt to strike as her ears are sharp to hear.""To me," said the Maid of Perth, again looking up, "the terrors of the
threatened denunciations would have been of little avail; but when they
spoke of involving thee, my father, in the charge against me, I own
I trembled, and desired to compromise.The Abbess Martha, of Elcho
nunnery, being my mother's kinswoman, I told her my distresses, and
obtained her promise that she would receive me, if, renouncing worldly
love and thoughts of wedlock, I would take the veil in her sisterhood.She had conversation on the topic, I doubt not, with the Dominican
Francis, and both joined in singing the same song."'Remain in the world,' said they, 'and thy father and thou shall be
brought to trial as heretics; assume the veil, and the errors of both
shall be forgiven and cancelled.'They spoke not even of recantation
of errors of doctrine: all should be peace if I would but enter the
convent.""I doubt not--I doubt not," said Simon: "the old glover is thought rich,
and his wealth would follow his daughter to the convent of Elcho, unless
what the Dominicans might claim as their own share.So this was thy call
to the veil, these thy objections to Henry Wynd?""Indeed, father, the course was urged on all hands, nor did my own
mind recoil from it.Sir John Ramorny threatened me with the powerful
vengeance of the young Prince, if I continued to repel his wicked suit;
and as for poor Henry, it is but of late that I have discovered, to
my own surprise--that--that I love his virtues more than I dislike his
faults.the discovery has only been made to render my quitting the
world more difficult than when I thought I had thee only to regret."She rested her head on her hand and wept bitterly."All this is folly," said the glover."Never was there an extremity so
pinching, but what a wise man might find counsel if he was daring enough
to act upon it.This has never been the land or the people over whom
priests could rule in the name of Rome, without their usurpation being
controlled.If they are to punish each honest burgher who says the
monks love gold, and that the lives of some of them cry shame upon the
doctrines they teach, why, truly, Stephen Smotherwell will not lack
employment; and if all foolish maidens are to be secluded from the world
because they follow the erring doctrines of a popular preaching friar,
they must enlarge the nunneries and receive their inmates on slighter
composition.Our privileges have been often defended against the Pope
himself by our good monarchs of yore, and when he pretended to interfere
with the temporal government of the kingdom, there wanted not a Scottish
Parliament who told him his duty in a letter that should have been
written in letters of gold.I have seen the epistle myself, and though
I could not read it, the very sight of the seals of the right reverend
prelates and noble and true barons which hung at it made my heart leap
for joy.Thou shouldst not have kept this secret, my child--but it is no
time to tax thee with thy fault.I will mount
instantly, and go to our Lord Provost and have his advice, and, as I
trust, his protection and that of other true hearted Scottish nobles,
who will not see a true man trodden down for an idle word."my father," said Catharine, "it was even this impetuosity which I
dreaded.I knew if I made my plaint to you there would soon be fire and
feud, as if religion, though sent to us by the Father of peace, were fit
only to be the mother of discord; and hence I could now--even now--give
up the world, and retire with my sorrow among the sisters of Elcho,
would you but let me be the sacrifice.Only, father--comfort poor Henry
when we are parted for ever; and do not--do not let him think of me too
harshly.Say Catharine will never vex him more by her remonstrances, but
that she will never forget him in her prayers.""The girl hath a tongue that would make a Saracen weep," said her
father, his own eyes sympathising with those of his daughter."But I
will not yield way to this combination between the nun and the priest to
rob me of my only child.Away with you, girl, and let me don my clothes;
and prepare yourself to obey me in what I may have to recommend for your
safety.Get a few clothes together, and what valuables thou hast; also,
take the keys of my iron box, which poor Henry Smith gave me, and divide
what gold you find into two portions; put the one into a purse for
thyself, and the other into the quilted girdle which I made on purpose
to wear on journeys.Thus both shall be provided, in case fate should
sunder us; in which event, God send the whirlwind may take the withered
leaf and spare the green one!Let them make ready my horse instantly,
and the white jennet that I bought for thee but a day since, hoping to
see thee ride to St.John's Kirk with maids and matrons, as blythe a
bride as ever crossed the holy threshold.Away, and remember that the saints help those who are willing to help
themselves.Not a word in answer; begone, I say--no wilfullness now.The
pilot in calm weather will let a sea boy trifle with the rudder; but, by
my soul, when winds howl and waves arise, he stands by the helm himself.Catharine left the room to execute, as well as she might, the commands
of her father, who, gentle in disposition and devotedly attached to his
child, suffered her often, as it seemed, to guide and rule both herself
and him; yet who, as she knew, was wont to claim filial obedience and
exercise parental authority with sufficient strictness when the occasion
seemed to require an enforcement of domestic discipline.While the fair Catharine was engaged in executing her father's behests,
and the good old glover was hastily attiring himself, as one who was
about to take a journey, a horse's tramp was heard in the narrow street.The horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak, having the cape of it
drawn up, as if to hide the under part of his face, while his bonnet was
pulled over his brows, and a broad plume obscured his upper features.He sprung from the saddle, and Dorothy had scarce time to reply to
his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom, ere the stranger had
ascended the stair and entered the sleeping apartment.Simon, astonished
and alarmed, and disposed to see in this early visitant an apparitor or
sumner come to attach him and his daughter, was much relieved when, as
the stranger doffed the bonnet and threw the skirt of the mantle from
his face, he recognised the knightly provost of the Fair City, a visit
from whom at any time was a favour of no ordinary degree, but, being
made at such an hour, had something marvellous, and, connected with the
circumstances of the times, even alarming."This high honour done to your
poor beadsman--"

"Hush!"said the knight, "there is no time for idle civilities.I came
hither because a man is, in trying occasions, his own safest page, and
I can remain no longer than to bid thee fly, good glover, since warrants
are to be granted this day in council for the arrest of thy daughter and
thee, under charge of heresy; and delay will cost you both your liberty
for certain, and perhaps your lives.""I have heard something of such a matter," said the glover, "and was
this instant setting forth to Kinfauns to plead my innocence of this
scandalous charge, to ask your lordship's counsel, and to implore your
protection.""Thy innocence, friend Simon, will avail thee but little before
prejudiced judges; my advice is, in one word, to fly, and wait for
happier times.As for my protection, we must tarry till the tide turns
ere it will in any sort avail thee.But if thou canst lie concealed for
a few days or weeks, I have little doubt that the churchmen, who, by
siding with the Duke of Albany in court intrigue, and by alleging
the decay of the purity of Catholic doctrine as the sole cause of the
present national misfortunes, have, at least for the present hour, an
irresistible authority over the King, will receive a check.In the mean
while, however, know that King Robert hath not only given way to this
general warrant for inquisition after heresy, but hath confirmed the
Pope's nomination of Henry Wardlaw to be Archbishop of St.Andrews and
Primate of Scotland; thus yielding to Rome those freedoms and immunities
of the Scottish Church which his ancestors, from the time of Malcolm
Canmore, have so boldly defended.His brave fathers would have rather
subscribed a covenant with the devil than yielded in such a matter to
the pretensions of Rome.""None, old man, save in some sudden court change," said Sir Patrick."The King is but like a mirror, which, having no light itself, reflects
back with equal readiness any which is placed near to it for the
time.Now, although the Douglas is banded with Albany, yet the Earl is
unfavourable to the high claims of those domineering priests, having
quarrelled with them about the exactions which his retinue hath raised
on the Abbot of Arbroath.He will come back again with a high hand, for
report says the Earl of March hath fled before him.When he returns
we shall have a changed world, for his presence will control Albany;
especially as many nobles, and I myself, as I tell you in confidence,
are resolved to league with him to defend the general right.Thy exile,
therefore, will end with his return to our court.Thou hast but to seek
thee some temporary hiding place.""For that, my lord," said the glover, "I can be at no loss, since I
have just title to the protection of the high Highland chief, Gilchrist
MacIan, chief of the Clan Quhele.""Nay, if thou canst take hold of his mantle thou needs no help of any
one else: neither Lowland churchman nor layman finds a free course of
justice beyond the Highland frontier.""But then my child, noble sir--my Catharine?"The graddan cake will keep her white teeth
in order, the goat's whey will make the blood spring to her cheek again,
which these alarms have banished and even the Fair Maiden of Perth may
sleep soft enough on a bed of Highland breckan.""It is not from such idle respects, my lord, that I hesitate," said the
glover."Catharine is the daughter of a plain burgher, and knows not
nicety of food or lodging.But the son of MacIan hath been for many
years a guest in my house, and I am obliged to say that I have observed
him looking at my daughter, who is as good as a betrothed bride, in a
manner that, though I cared not for it in this lodging in Curfew Street,
would give me some fear of consequences in a Highland glen, where I have
no friend and Conachar many."The knightly provost replied by a long whistle.Nay, in
that case, I advise thee to send her to the nunnery at Elcho, where the
abbess, if I forget not, is some relation of yours.Indeed, she said so
herself, adding, that she loved her kinswoman well, together with all
that belongs to thee, Simon.""Truly, my lord, I do believe that the abbess hath so much regard for
me, that she would willingly receive the trust of my daughter, and
my whole goods and gear, into her sisterhood.Marry, her affection is
something of a tenacious character, and would be loth to unloose its
hold, either upon the wench or her tocher."again whistled the Knight of Kinfauns; "by the Thane's
Cross, man, but this is an ill favoured pirn to wind: Yet it shall never
be said the fairest maid in the Fair City was cooped up in a convent,
like a kain hen in a cavey, and she about to be married to the bold
burgess Henry Wynd.That tale shall not be told while I wear belt and
spurs, and am called Provost of Perth.""We must all take our share of the risk.Come, get you and your daughter
presently to horse.You shall ride with me, and we'll see who dare
gloom at you.The summons is not yet served on thee, and if they send
an apparitor to Kinfauns without a warrant under the King's own hand,
I make mine avow, by the Red Rover's soul!that he shall eat his
writ, both wax and wether skin.and," addressing
Catharine, as she entered at the moment, "you too, my pretty maid--

"To horse, and fear not for your quarters; They thrive in law that trust
in Charters."In a minute or two the father and daughter were on horseback, both
keeping an arrow's flight before the provost, by his direction, that
they might not seem to be of the same company.They passed the eastern
gate in some haste, and rode forward roundly until they were out of
sight.Sir Patrick followed leisurely; but, when he was lost to the view
of the warders, he spurred his mettled horse, and soon came up with the
glover and Catharine, when a conversation ensued which throws light upon
some previous passages of this history.seed of those who scorn'd
     To stoop the neck to wide imperial Rome--
     Oh, dearest half of Albion sea walled!"I have been devising a mode," said the well meaning provost, "by which
I may make you both secure for a week or two from the malice of your
enemies, when I have little doubt I may see a changed world at court.But that I may the better judge what is to be done, tell me frankly,
Simon, the nature of your connexion with Gilchrist MacIan, which leads
you to repose such implicit confidence in him.You are a close observer
of the rules of the city, and are aware of the severe penalties which
they denounce against such burghers as have covine and alliance with the
Highland clans.""True, my lord; but it is also known to you that our craft, working in
skins of cattle, stags, and every other description of hides, have a
privilege, and are allowed to transact with those Highlanders, as with
the men who can most readily supply us with the means of conducting our
trade, to the great profit of the burgh.Thus it hath chanced with me to
have great dealings with these men; and I can take it on my salvation,
that you nowhere find more just and honourable traffickers, or by whom a
man may more easily make an honest penny.I have made in my day several
distant journeys into the far Highlands, upon the faith of their chiefs;
nor did I ever meet with a people more true to their word, when you
can once prevail upon them to plight it in your behalf.And as for the
Highland chief, Gilchrist MacIan, saving that he is hasty in homicide
and fire raising towards those with whom he hath deadly feud, I have
nowhere seen a man who walketh a more just and upright path.""It is more than ever I heard before," said Sir Patrick Charteris."Yet
I have known something of the Highland runagates too.""They show another favour, and a very different one, to their friends
than to their enemies, as your lordship shall understand," said the
glover."However, be that as it may, it chanced me to serve Gilchrist
MacIan in a high matter.It is now about eighteen years since, that it
chanced, the Clan Quhele and Clan Chattan being at feud, as indeed they
are seldom at peace, the former sustained such a defeat as well nigh
extirpated the family of their chief MacIan.Seven of his sons were
slain in battle and after it, himself put to flight, and his castle
taken and given to the flames.His wife, then near the time of giving
birth to an infant, fled into the forest, attended by one faithful
servant and his daughter.Here, in sorrow and care enough, she gave
birth to a boy; and as the misery of the mother's condition rendered her
little able to suckle the infant, he was nursed with the milk of a doe,
which the forester who attended her contrived to take alive in a snare.It was not many months afterwards that, in a second encounter of these
fierce clans, MacIan defeated his enemies in his turn, and regained
possession of the district which he had lost.It was with unexpected
rapture that he found his wife and child were in existence, having never
expected to see more of them than the bleached bones, from which the
wolves and wildcats had eaten the flesh."But a strong and prevailing prejudice, such as is often entertained
by these wild people, prevented their chief from enjoying the full
happiness arising from having thus regained his only son in safety.An
ancient prophecy was current among them, that the power of the tribe
should fall by means of a boy born under a bush of holly and suckled
by a white doe.The circumstance, unfortunately for the chief, tallied
exactly with the birth of the only child which remained to him, and it
was demanded of him by the elders of the clan, that the boy should be
either put to death or at least removed from the dominions of the tribe
and brought up in obscurity.Gilchrist MacIan was obliged to consent and
having made choice of the latter proposal, the child, under the name of
Conachar, was brought up in my family, with the purpose, as was at first
intended, of concealing from him all knowledge who or what he was, or of
his pretensions to authority over a numerous and warlike people.But,
as years rolled on, the elders of the tribe, who had exerted so much
authority, were removed by death, or rendered incapable of interfering
in the public affairs by age; while, on the other hand, the influence of
Gilchrist MacIan was increased by his successful struggles against
the Clan Chattan, in which he restored the equality betwixt the two
contending confederacies, which had existed before the calamitous defeat
of which I told your honour.Feeling himself thus firmly seated, he
naturally became desirous to bring home his only son to his bosom and
family; and for that purpose caused me to send the young Conachar, as
he was called, more than once to the Highlands.He was a youth expressly
made, by his form and gallantry of bearing, to gain a father's heart.At length, I suppose the lad either guessed the secret of his birth
or something of it was communicated to him; and the disgust which the
paughty Hieland varlet had always shown for my honest trade became more
manifest; so that I dared not so much as lay my staff over his costard,
for fear of receiving a stab with a dirk, as an answer in Gaelic to
a Saxon remark.It was then that I wished to be well rid of him, the
rather that he showed so much devotion to Catharine, who, forsooth, set
herself up to wash the Ethiopian, and teach a wild Hielandmnan mercy and
morals."Nay, my father," said Catharine, "it was surely but a point of charity
to snatch the brand from the burning.""But a small point of wisdom," said her father, "to risk the burning of
your own fingers for such an end."My lord would not offend the Fair Maid of Perth," said Sir Patrick;
"and he knows well the purity and truth of her mind.And yet I must
needs say that, had this nursling of the doe been shrivelled, haggard,
cross made, and red haired, like some Highlanders I have known, I
question if the Fair Maiden of Perth would have bestowed so much zeal
upon his conversion; and if Catharine had been as aged, wrinkled, and
bent by years as the old woman that opened the door for me this morning,
I would wager my gold spurs against a pair of Highland brogues that this
wild roebuck would never have listened to a second lecture.You laugh,
glover, and Catharine blushes a blush of anger.Let it pass, it is the
way of the world.""The way in which the men of the world esteem their neighbours, my
lord," answered Catharine, with some spirit."Nay, fair saint, forgive a jest," said the knight; "and thou, Simon,
tell us how this tale ended--with Conachar's escape to the Highlands, I
suppose?""With his return thither," said the glover."There was, for some two
or three years, a fellow about Perth, a sort of messenger, who came
and went under divers pretences, but was, in fact, the means of
communication between Gilchrist MacIan and his son, young Conachar, or,
as he is now called, Hector.From this gillie I learned, in general,
that the banishment of the dault an neigh dheil, or foster child of
the white doe, was again brought under consideration of the tribe.His
foster father, Torquil of the Oak, the old forester, appeared with
eight sons, the finest men of the clan, and demanded that the doom of
banishment should be revoked.He spoke with the greater authority, as
he was himself taishatar, or a seer, and supposed to have communication
with the invisible world.He affirmed that he had performed a magical
ceremony, termed tine egan, by which he evoked a fiend, from whom he
extorted a confession that Conachar, now called Eachin, or Hector,
MacIan, was the only man in the approaching combat between the two
hostile clans who should come off without blood or blemish.Hence
Torquil of the Oak argued that the presence of the fated person was
necessary to ensure the victory.'So much I am possessed of this,' said
the forester, 'that, unless Eachin fight in his place in the ranks of
the Clan Quhele, neither I, his foster father, nor any of my eight sons
will lift a weapon in the quarrel.'"This speech was received with much alarm; for the defection of
nine men, the stoutest of their tribe, would be a serious blow, more
especially if the combat, as begins to be rumoured, should be decided by
a small number from each side.The ancient superstition concerning
the foster son of the white doe was counterbalanced by a new and later
prejudice, and the father took the opportunity of presenting to the
clan his long hidden son, whose youthful, but handsome and animated,
countenance, haughty carriage, and active limbs excited the admiration
of the clansmen, who joyfully received him as the heir and descendant of
their chief, notwithstanding the ominous presage attending his birth and
nurture."From this tale, my lord," continued Simon Glover, "your lordship may
easily conceive why I myself should be secure of a good reception among
the Clan Quhele; and you may also have reason to judge that it would be
very rash in me to carry Catharine thither.And this, noble lord, is the
heaviest of my troubles.""We shall lighten the load, then," said Sir Patrick; "and, good glover,
I will take risk for thee and this damsel.My alliance with the Douglas
gives me some interest with Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, his daughter,
the neglected wife of our wilful Prince.Rely on it, good glover, that
in her retinue thy daughter will be as secure as in a fenced castle.The
Duchess keeps house now at Falkland, a castle which the Duke of Albany,
to whom it belongs, has lent to her for her accommodation.I cannot
promise you pleasure, Fair Maiden; for the Duchess Marjory of Rothsay
is unfortunate, and therefore splenetic, haughty, and overbearing;
conscious of the want of attractive qualities, therefore jealous of
those women who possess them.But she is firm in faith and noble in
spirit, and would fling Pope or prelate into the ditch of her castle who
should come to arrest any one under her protection.You will therefore
have absolute safety, though you may lack comfort.""I have no title to more," said Catharine; "and deeply do I feel the
kindness that is willing to secure me such honourable protection.If she
be haughty, I will remember she is a Douglas, and hath right, as being
such, to entertain as much pride as may become a mortal; if she be
fretful, I will recollect that she is unfortunate, and if she be
unreasonably captious, I will not forget that she is my protectress.Heed no longer for me, my lord, when you have placed me under the noble
lady's charge.But my poor father, to be exposed amongst these wild and
dangerous people!""Think not of that, Catharine," said the glover: "I am as familiar with
brogues and bracken as if I had worn them myself.I have only to fear
that the decisive battle may be fought before I can leave this country;
and if the clan Quhele lose the combat, I may suffer by the ruin of my
protectors.""We must have that cared for," said Sir Patrick: "rely on my looking out
for your safety.But which party will carry the day, think you?""Frankly, my Lord Provost, I believe the Clan Chattan will have the
worse: these nine children of the forest form a third nearly of the band
surrounding the chief of Clan Quhele, and are redoubted champions.""And your apprentice, will he stand to it, thinkest thou?""He is hot as fire, Sir Patrick," answered the glover; "but he is also
unstable as water.Nevertheless, if he is spared, he seems likely to be
one day a brave man.""But, as now, he has some of the white doe's milk still lurking about
his liver, ha, Simon?""He has little experience, my lord," said the glover, "and I need not
tell an honoured warrior like yourself that danger must be familiar to
us ere we can dally with it like a mistress."This conversation brought them speedily to the Castle of Kinfauns,
where, after a short refreshment, it was necessary that the father and
the daughter should part, in order to seek their respective places of
refuge.It was then first, as she saw that her father's anxiety on her
account had drowned all recollections of his friend, that Catharine
dropped, as if in a dream, the name of "Henry Gow.""True--most true," continued her father; "we must possess him of our
purposes.""Leave that to me," said Sir Patrick."I will not trust to a messenger,
nor will I send a letter, because, if I could write one, I think he
could not read it.He will suffer anxiety in the mean while, but I will
ride to Perth tomorrow by times and acquaint him with your designs."It was a bitter moment, but
the manly character of the old burgher, and the devout resignation of
Catharine to the will of Providence made it lighter than might have been
expected.The good knight hurried the departure of the burgess, but
in the kindest manner; and even went so far as to offer him some gold
pieces in loan, which might, where specie was so scarce, be considered
as the ne plus ultra of regard.The glover, however, assured him he
was amply provided, and departed on his journey in a northwesterly
direction.The hospitable protection of Sir Patrick Charteris was no
less manifested towards his fair guest.She was placed under the charge
of a duenna who managed the good knight's household, and was compelled
to remain several days in Kinfauns, owing to the obstacles and delays
interposed by a Tay boatman, named Kitt Henshaw, to whose charge she was
to be committed, and whom the provost highly trusted.Thus were severed the child and parent in a moment of great danger and
difficulty, much augmented by circumstances of which they were then
ignorant, and which seemed greatly to diminish any chance of safety that
remained for them."Austin may do the same again for me."Pope's Prologue to Canterbury Tales from Chaucer.The course of our story will be best pursued by attending that of Simon
Glover.It is not our purpose to indicate the exact local boundaries of
the two contending clans, especially since they are not clearly pointed
out by the historians who have transmitted accounts of this memorable
feud.It is sufficient to say, that the territory of the Clan Chattan
extended far and wide, comprehending Caithness and Sutherland, and
having for their paramount chief the powerful earl of the latter shire,
thence called Mohr ar Chat.In this general sense, the Keiths, the
Sinclairs, the Guns, and other families and clans of great power, were
included in the confederacy.These, however, were not engaged in the
present quarrel, which was limited to that part of the Clan Chattan
occupying the extensive mountainous districts of Perthshire and
Inverness shire, which form a large portion of what is called the
northeastern Highlands.It is well known that two large septs,
unquestionably known to belong to the Clan Chattan, the MacPhersons and
the MacIntoshes, dispute to this day which of their chieftains was at
the head of this Badenoch branch of the great confederacy, and both have
of later times assumed the title of Captain of Clan Chattan.But, at all events, Badenoch must have been the centre of the
confederacy, so far as involved in the feud of which we treat.Of the rival league of Clan Quhele we have a still less distinct
account, for reasons which will appear in the sequel.Some authors have
identified them with the numerous and powerful sept of MacKay.If this
is done on good authority, which is to be doubted, the MacKays must have
shifted their settlements greatly since the reign of Robert III, since
they are now to be found (as a clan) in the extreme northern parts of
Scotland, in the counties of Ross and Sutherland.We cannot, therefore,
be so clear as we would wish in the geography of the story.Suffice
it that, directing his course in a northwesterly direction, the glover
travelled for a day's journey in the direction of the Breadalbane
country, from which he hoped to reach the castle where Gilchrist MacIan,
the captain of the Clan Quhele, and the father of his pupil Conachar,
usually held his residence, with a barbarous pomp of attendance and
ceremonial suited to his lofty pretensions.We need not stop to describe the toil and terrors of such a journey,
where the path was to be traced among wastes and mountains, now
ascending precipitous ravines, now plunging into inextricable bogs,
and often intersected with large brooks, and even rivers.But all these
perils Simon Glover had before encountered in quest of honest gain; and
it was not to be supposed that he shunned or feared them where liberty,
and life itself, were at stake.The danger from the warlike and uncivilised inhabitants of these wilds
would have appeared to another at least as formidable as the perils of
the journey.But Simon's knowledge of the manners and language of the
people assured him on this point also.An appeal to the hospitality of
the wildest Gael was never unsuccessful; and the kerne, that in other
circumstances would have taken a man's life for the silver button of
his cloak, would deprive himself of a meal to relieve the traveller who
implored hospitality at the door of his bothy.The art of travelling in
the Highlands was to appear as confident and defenceless as possible;
and accordingly the glover carried no arms whatever, journeyed without
the least appearance of precaution, and took good care to exhibit
nothing which might excite cupidity.Another rule which he deemed it
prudent to observe was to avoid communication with any of the passengers
whom he might chance to meet, except in the interchange of the common
civilities of salutation, which the Highlanders rarely omit.Few
opportunities occurred of exchanging even such passing greetings.The
country, always lonely, seemed now entirely forsaken; and, even in the
little straths or valleys which he had occasion to pass or traverse,
the hamlets were deserted, and the inhabitants had betaken themselves to
woods and caves.This was easily accounted for, considering the imminent
dangers of a feud which all expected would become one of the most
general signals for plunder and ravage that had ever distracted that
unhappy country.Simon began to be alarmed at this state of desolation.He had made a
halt since he left Kinfauns, to allow his nag some rest; and now he
began to be anxious how he was to pass the night.He had reckoned
upon spending it at the cottage of an old acquaintance, called Niel
Booshalloch (or the cow herd), because he had charge of numerous herds
of cattle belonging to the captain of Clan Quhele, for which purpose he
had a settlement on the banks of the Tay, not far from the spot where
it leaves the lake of the same name.From this his old host and friend,
with whom he had transacted many bargains for hides and furs, the old
glover hoped to learn the present state of the country, the prospect of
peace or war, and the best measures to be taken for his own safety.It
will be remembered that the news of the indentures of battle entered
into for diminishing the extent of the feud had only been communicated
to King Robert the day before the glover left Perth, and did not become
public till some time afterwards."If Niel Booshalloch hath left his dwelling like the rest of them, I
shall be finely holped up," thought Simon, "since I want not only the
advantage of his good advice, but also his interest with Gilchrist
MacIan; and, moreover, a night's quarters and a supper."Thus reflecting, he reached the top of a swelling green hill, and saw
the splendid vision of Loch Tay lying beneath him--an immense plate of
polished silver, its dark heathy mountains and leafless thickets of oak
serving as an arabesque frame to a magnificent mirror.Indifferent to natural beauty at any time, Simon Glover was now
particularly so; and the only part of the splendid landscape on which he
turned his eye was an angle or loop of meadow land where the river Tay,
rushing in full swoln dignity from its parent lake, and wheeling around
a beautiful valley of about a mile in breadth, begins his broad course
to the southeastward, like a conqueror and a legislator, to subdue
and to enrich remote districts.Upon the sequestered spot, which is so
beautifully situated between lake, mountain, and river, arose afterwards
the feudal castle of the Ballough [Balloch is Gaelic for the discharge
of a lake into a river], which in our time has been succeeded by the
splendid palace of the Earls of Breadalbane.But the Campbells, though they had already attained very great power
in Argyleshire, had not yet extended themselves so far eastward as Loch
Tay, the banks of which were, either by right or by mere occupancy,
possessed for, the present by the Clan Quhele, whose choicest herds were
fattened on the Balloch margin of the lake.In this valley, therefore,
between the river and the lake, amid extensive forests of oak wood,
hazel, rowan tree, and larches, arose the humble cottage of Niel
Booshalloch, a village Eumaeus, whose hospitable chimneys were seen to
smoke plentifully, to the great encouragement of Simon Glover, who might
otherwise have been obliged to spend the night in the open air, to his
no small discomfort.He reached the door of the cottage, whistled, shouted, and made his
approach known.There was a baying of hounds and collies, and presently
the master of the hut came forth.There was much care on his brow, and
he seemed surprised at the sight of Simon Glover, though the herdsman
covered both as well as he might; for nothing in that region could be
reckoned more uncivil than for the landlord to suffer anything to escape
him in look or gesture which might induce the visitor to think that
his arrival was an unpleasing, or even an unexpected, incident.The
traveller's horse was conducted to a stable, which was almost too low
to receive him, and the glover himself was led into the mansion of the
Booshalloch, where, according to the custom of the country, bread
and cheese was placed before the wayfarer, while more solid food was
preparing.Simon, who understood all their habits, took no notice of the
obvious marks of sadness on the brow of his entertainer and on those of
the family, until he had eaten somewhat for form's sake, after which he
asked the general question, "Was there any news in the country?""Bad news as ever were told," said the herdsman: "our father is no
more."said Simon, greatly alarmed, "is the captain of the Clan Quhele
dead?""The captain of the Clan Quhele never dies," answered the Booshalloch;
"but Gilchrist MacIan died twenty hours since, and his son, Eachin
MacIan, is now captain.""What, Eachin--that is Conachar--my apprentice?""As little of that subject as you list, brother Simon," said the
herdsman."It is to be remembered, friend, that your craft, which doth
very well for a living in the douce city of Perth, is something too
mechanical to be much esteemed at the foot of Ben Lawers and on the
banks of Loch Tay.We have not a Gaelic word by which we can even name a
maker of gloves.""It would be strange if you had, friend Niel," said Simon, drily,
"having so few gloves to wear.I think there be none in the whole Clan
Quhele, save those which I myself gave to Gilchrist MacIan, whom God
assoilzie, who esteemed them a choice propine.Most deeply do I regret
his death, for I was coming to him on express business.""You had better turn the nag's head southward with morning light," said
the herdsman."The funeral is instantly to take place, and it must be
with short ceremony; for there is a battle to be fought by the Clan
Quhele and the Clan Chattan, thirty champions on a side, as soon as Palm
Sunday next, and we have brief time either to lament the dead or honour
the living.""Yet are my affairs so pressing, that I must needs see the young chief,
were it but for a quarter of an hour," said the glover."Hark thee, friend," replied his host, "I think thy business must be
either to gather money or to make traffic.Now, if the chief owe thee
anything for upbringing or otherwise, ask him not to pay it when all the
treasures of the tribe are called in for making gallant preparation of
arms and equipment for their combatants, that we may meet these proud
hill cats in a fashion to show ourselves their superiors.But if thou
comest to practise commerce with us, thy time is still worse chosen.Thou knowest that thou art already envied of many of our tribe, for
having had the fosterage of the young chief, which is a thing usually
given to the best of the clan."'exclaimed the glover, "men should remember the
office was not conferred on me as a favour which I courted, but that
it was accepted by me on importunity and entreaty, to my no small
prejudice.This Conachar, or Hector, of yours, or whatever you call him,
has destroyed me doe skins to the amount of many pounds Scots.""There again, now," said the Booshalloch, "you have spoken word to cost
your life--any allusion to skins or hides, or especially to deer and
does--may incur no less a forfeit.The chief is young, and jealous of
his rank; none knows the reason better than thou, friend Glover.He
will naturally wish that everything concerning the opposition to
his succession, and having reference to his exile, should be totally
forgotten; and he will not hold him in affection who shall recall the
recollection of his people, or force back his own, upon what they must
both remember with pain.Think how, at such a moment, they will look
on the old glover of Perth, to whom the chief was so long apprentice!Come--come, old friend, you have erred in this.You are in over great
haste to worship the rising sun, while his beams are yet level with the
horizon.Come thou when he has climbed higher in the heavens, and thou
shalt have thy share of the warmth of his noonday height.""Niel Booshalloch," said the glover, "we have been old friends, as thou
say'st; and as I think thee a true one, I will speak to thee freely,
though what I say might be perilous if spoken to others of thy clan.Thou think'st I come hither to make my own profit of thy young chief,
and it is natural thou shouldst think so.But I would not, at my years,
quit my own chimney corner in Curfew Street to bask me in the beams of
the brightest sun that ever shone upon Highland heather.The very truth
is, I come hither in extremity: my foes have the advantage of me, and
have laid things to my charge whereof I am incapable, even in thought.Nevertheless, doom is like to go forth against me, and there is no
remedy but that I must up and fly, or remain and perish.I come to your
young chief, as one who had refuge with me in his distress--who ate of
my bread and drank of my cup.I ask of him refuge, which, as I trust, I
shall need but a short time.""That makes a different case," replied the herdsman."So different,
that, if you came at midnight to the gate of MacIan, having the King
of Scotland's head in your hand, and a thousand men in pursuit for the
avenging of his blood, I could not think it for his honour to refuse you
protection.And for your innocence or guilt, it concerns not the case;
or rather, he ought the more to shelter you if guilty, seeing your
necessity and his risk are both in that case the greater.I must
straightway to him, that no hasty tongue tell him of your arriving
hither without saying the cause.""A pity of your trouble," said the glover; "but where lies the chief?""He is quartered about ten miles hence, busied with the affairs of the
funeral, and with preparations for the combat--the dead to the grave and
the living to battle.""It is a long way, and will take you all night to go and come," said the
glover; "and I am very sure that Conachar when he knows it is I who--"

"Forget Conachar," said the herdsman, placing his finger on his lips."And as for the ten miles, they are but a Highland leap, when one bears
a message between his friend and his chief."So saying, and committing the traveller to the charge of his eldest son
and his daughter, the active herdsman left his house two hours before
midnight, to which he returned long before sunrise.He did not disturb
his wearied guest, but when the old man had arisen in the morning he
acquainted him that the funeral of the late chieftain was to take place
the same day, and that, although Eachin MacIan could not invite a Saxon
to the funeral, he would be glad to receive him at the entertainment
which was to follow."His will must be obeyed," said the glover, half smiling at the change
of relation between himself and his late apprentice."The man is
the master now, and I trust he will remember that, when matters were
otherwise between us, I did not use my authority ungraciously."exclaimed the Booshalloch, "the less of that you say
the better.You will find yourself a right welcome guest to Eachin, and
the deil a man dares stir you within his bounds.But fare you well, for
I must go, as beseems me, to the burial of the best chief the clan ever
had, and the wisest captain that ever cocked the sweet gale (bog myrtle)
in his bonnet.Farewell to you for a while, and if you will go to the
top of the Tom an Lonach behind the house, you will see a gallant sight,
and hear such a coronach as will reach the top of Ben Lawers.A boat
will wait for you, three hours hence, at a wee bit creek about half a
mile westward from the head of the Tay."With these words he took his departure, followed by his three sons, to
man the boat in which he was to join the rest of the mourners, and two
daughters, whose voices were wanted to join in the lament, which was
chanted, or rather screamed, on such occasions of general affliction.Simon Glover, finding himself alone, resorted to the stable to look
after his nag, which, he found, had been well served with graddan, or
bread made of scorched barley.Of this kindness he was fully sensible,
knowing that, probably, the family had little of this delicacy left to
themselves until the next harvest should bring them a scanty supply.In
animal food they were well provided, and the lake found them abundance
of fish for their lenten diet, which they did not observe very strictly;
but bread was a delicacy very scanty in the Highlands.The bogs afforded
a soft species of hay, none of the best to be sure; but Scottish horses,
like their riders, were then accustomed to hard fare.Gauntlet, for this was the name of the palfrey, had his stall crammed
full of dried fern for litter, and was otherwise as well provided for as
Highland hospitality could contrive.Simon Glover being thus left to his own painful reflections, nothing
better remained, after having seen after the comforts of the dumb
companion of his journey, than to follow the herdsman's advice; and
ascending towards the top of an eminence called Tom an Lonach, or the
Knoll of Yew Trees, after a walk of half an hour he reached the summit,
and could look down on the broad expanse of the lake, of which the
height commanded a noble view.A few aged and scattered yew trees
of great size still vindicated for the beautiful green hill the name
attached to it.But a far greater number had fallen a sacrifice to
the general demand for bow staves in that warlike age, the bow being a
weapon much used by the mountaineers, though those which they employed,
as well as their arrows, were, in shape and form, and especially in
efficacy, far inferior to the archery of merry England.The dark and
shattered individual yews which remained were like the veterans of a
broken host, occupying in disorder some post of advantage, with the
stern purpose of resisting to the last.Behind this eminence, but
detached from it, arose a higher hill, partly covered with copsewood,
partly opening into glades of pasture, where the cattle strayed,
finding, at this season of the year, a scanty sustenance among the
spring heads and marshy places, where the fresh grass began first to
arise.The opposite or northern shore of the lake presented a far more Alpine
prospect than that upon which the glover was stationed.Woods and
thickets ran up the sides of the mountains, and disappeared among the
sinuosities formed by the winding ravines which separated them from each
other; but far above these specimens of a tolerable natural soil arose
the swart and bare mountains themselves, in the dark grey desolation
proper to the season.Some were peaked, some broad crested, some rocky and precipitous, others
of a tamer outline; and the clan of Titans seemed to be commanded by
their appropriate chieftains--the frowning mountain of Ben Lawers, and
the still more lofty eminence of Ben Mohr, arising high above the rest,
whose peaks retain a dazzling helmet of snow far into the summer season,
and sometimes during the whole year.Yet the borders of this wild and
silvan region, where the mountains descended upon the lake, intimated,
even at that early period, many traces of human habitation.Hamlets were
seen, especially on the northern margin of the lake, half hid among the
little glens that poured their tributary streams into Loch Tay, which,
like many earthly things, made a fair show at a distance, but, when more
closely approached, were disgustful and repulsive, from their squalid
want of the conveniences which attend even Indian wigwams.They were
inhabited by a race who neither cultivated the earth nor cared for
the enjoyments which industry procures.The women, although otherwise
treated with affection, and even delicacy of respect, discharged all the
absolutely necessary domestic labour.The men, excepting some reluctant
use of an ill formed plough, or more frequently a spade, grudgingly gone
through, as a task infinitely beneath them, took no other employment
than the charge of the herds of black cattle, in which their wealth
consisted.At all other times they hunted, fished, or marauded, during
the brief intervals of peace, by way of pastime; plundering with bolder
license, and fighting with embittered animosity, in time of war, which,
public or private, upon a broader or more restricted scale, formed the
proper business of their lives, and the only one which they esteemed
worthy of them.The magnificent bosom of the lake itself was a scene to gaze on with
delight.Its noble breadth, with its termination in a full and beautiful
run, was rendered yet more picturesque by one of those islets which are
often happily situated in the Scottish lakes.The ruins upon that isle,
now almost shapeless, being overgrown with wood rose, at the time we
speak of, into the towers and pinnacles of a priory, where slumbered
the remains of Sibylla, daughter of Henry I of England, and consort
of Alexander the First of Scotland.This holy place had been deemed of
dignity sufficient to be the deposit of the remains of the captain of
the Clan Quhele, at least till times when the removal of the danger, now
so imminently pressing, should permit of his body being conveyed to a
distinguished convent in the north, where he was destined ultimately to
repose with all his ancestry.A number of boats pushed off from various points of the near and more
distant shore, many displaying sable banners, and others having their
several pipers in the bow, who from time to time poured forth a few
notes of a shrill, plaintive, and wailing character, and intimated to
the glover that the ceremony was about to take place.These sounds of
lamentation were but the tuning as it were of the instruments, compared
with the general wail which was speedily to be raised.A distant sound was heard from far up the lake, even as it seemed from
the remote and distant glens out of which the Dochart and the Lochy pour
their streams into Loch Tay.It was in a wild, inaccessible spot, where
the Campbells at a subsequent period founded their strong fortress of
Finlayrigg, that the redoubted commander of the Clan Quhele drew his
last breath; and, to give due pomp to his funeral, his corpse was now to
be brought down the loch to the island assigned for his temporary place
of rest.The funeral fleet, led by the chieftain's barge, from which a
huge black banner was displayed, had made more than two thirds of its
voyage ere it was visible from the eminence on which Simon Glover stood
to overlook the ceremony.The instant the distant wail of the coronach
was heard proceeding from the attendants on the funeral barge, all the
subordinate sounds of lamentation were hushed at once, as the raven
ceases to croak and the hawk to whistle whenever the scream of the eagle
is heard.The boats, which had floated hither and thither upon the lake,
like a flock of waterfowl dispersing themselves on its surface, now drew
together with an appearance of order, that the funeral flotilla might
pass onward, and that they themselves might fall into their proper
places.In the mean while the piercing din of the war pipes became
louder and louder, and the cry from the numberless boats which followed
that from which the black banner of the chief was displayed rose in
wild unison up to the Tom an Lonach, from which the glover viewed the
spectacle.The galley which headed the procession bore on its poop a
species of scaffold, upon which, arrayed in white linen, and with the
face bare, was displayed the corpse of the deceased chieftain.His son
and the nearest relatives filled the vessel, while a great number of
boats, of every description that could be assembled, either on Loch
Tay itself or brought by land carriage from Loch Earn and otherwise,
followed in the rear, some of them of very frail materials.There were
even curraghs, composed of ox hides stretched over hoops of willow,
in the manner of the ancient British, and some committed themselves
to rafts formed for the occasion, from the readiest materials that
occurred, and united in such a precarious manner as to render it
probable that, before the accomplishment of the voyage, some of the
clansmen of the deceased might be sent to attend their chieftain in the
world of spirits.When the principal flotilla came in sight of the smaller group of boats
collected towards the foot of the lake, and bearing off from the little
island, they hailed each other with a shout so loud and general, and
terminating in a cadence so wildly prolonged, that not only the deer
started from their glens for miles around, and sought the distant
recesses of the mountains, but even the domestic cattle, accustomed to
the voice of man, felt the full panic which the human shout strikes into
the wilder tribes, and like them fled from their pasture into morasses
and dingles.Summoned forth from their convent by those sounds, the monks who
inhabited the little islet began to issue from their lowly portal, with
cross and banner, and as much of ecclesiastical state as they had the
means of displaying; their bells at the same time, of which the edifice
possessed three, pealing the death toll over the long lake, which came
to the ears of the now silent multitude, mingled with the solemn chant
of the Catholic Church, raised by the monks in their procession.Various
ceremonies were gone through, while the kindred of the deceased carried
the body ashore, and, placing it on a bank long consecrated to the
purpose, made the deasil around the departed.When the corpse was
uplifted to be borne into the church, another united yell burst from the
assembled multitude, in which the deep shout of warriors and the shrill
wail of females joined their notes with the tremulous voice of age and
the babbling cry of childhood.The coronach was again, and for the last
time, shrieked as the body was carried into the interior of the
church, where only the nearest relatives of the deceased and the most
distinguished of the leaders of the clan were permitted to enter.The
last yell of woe was so terribly loud, and answered by so many hundred
echoes, that the glover instinctively raised his hands to his ears, to
shut out, or deaden at least, a sound so piercing.He kept this attitude
while the hawks, owls, and other birds, scared by the wild scream, had
begun to settle in their retreats, when, as he withdrew his hands, a
voice close by him said:

"Think you this, Simon Glover, the hymn of penitence and praise with
which it becomes poor forlorn man, cast out from his tenement of clay,
to be wafted into the presence of his maker?"The glover turned, and in the old man with a long white beard who stood
close beside him had no difficulty, from the clear mild eye and the
benevolent cast of features, to recognise the Carthusian monk Father
Clement, no longer wearing his monastic habiliments, but wrapped in a
frieze mantle and having a Highland cap on his head.It may be recollected that the glover regarded this man with a combined
feeling of respect and dislike--respect, which his judgment could not
deny to the monk's person and character, and dislike, which arose from
Father Clement's peculiar doctrines being the cause of his daughter's
exile and his own distress.It was not, therefore, with sentiments of
unmixed satisfaction that he returned the greetings of the father, and
replied to the reiterated question, what he thought of the funeral rites
which were discharged in so wild a manner: "I know not, my good father;
but these men do their duty to their deceased chief according to the
fashion of their ancestors: they mean to express their regret for their
friend's loss and their prayers to Heaven in his behalf; and that which
is done of goodwill must, to my thinking, be accepted favourably.Had
it been otherwise, methinks they had ere now been enlightened to do
better.""Thou art deceived," answered the monk."God has sent His light amongst
us all, though in various proportions; but man wilfully shuts his eyes
and prefers darkness.This benighted people mingle with the ritual of
the Roman Church the old heathen ceremonies of their own fathers, and
thus unite with the abominations of a church corrupted by wealth and
power the cruel and bloody ritual of savage paynims.""Father," said Simon, abruptly, "methinks your presence were more
useful in yonder chapel, aiding your brethren in the discharge of their
clerical duties, than in troubling and unsettling the belief of an
humble though ignorant Christian like myself.""And wherefore say, good brother, that I would unfix thy principles of
belief?""So Heaven deal with me, as, were my life
blood necessary to cement the mind of any man to the holy religion he
professeth, it should be freely poured out for the purpose.""Your speech is fair, father, I grant you," said the glover; "but if I
am to judge the doctrine by the fruits, Heaven has punished me by the
hand of the church for having hearkened thereto.Ere I heard you, my
confessor was little moved though I might have owned to have told
a merry tale upon the ale bench, even if a friar or a nun were the
subject.If at a time I had called Father Hubert a better hunter of
hares than of souls, I confessed me to the Vicar Vinesauf, who laughed
and made me pay a reckoning for penance; or if I had said that the Vicar
Vinesauf was more constant to his cup than to his breviary, I confessed
me to Father Hubert, and a new hawking glove made all well again; and
thus I, my conscience, and Mother Church lived together on terms of
peace, friendship, and mutual forbearance.But since I have listened to
you, Father Clement, this goodly union is broke to pieces, and nothing
is thundered in my ear but purgatory in the next world and fire and
fagot in this.Therefore, avoid you, Father Clement, or speak to those
who can understand your doctrine.I have no heart to be a martyr: I have
never in my whole life had courage enough so much as to snuff a candle
with my fingers; and, to speak the truth, I am minded to go back to
Perth, sue out my pardon in the spiritual court, carry my fagot to the
gallows foot in token of recantation, and purchase myself once more the
name of a good Catholic, were it at the price of all the worldly wealth
that remains to me.""You are angry, my dearest brother," said Clement, "and repent you on
the pinch of a little worldly danger and a little worldly loss for the
good thoughts which you once entertained.""You speak at ease, Father Clement, since I think you have long forsworn
the wealth and goods of the world, and are prepared to yield up your
life when it is demanded in exchange for the doctrine you preach and
believe.You are as ready to put on your pitched shirt and brimstone
head gear as a naked man is to go to his bed, and it would seem you have
not much more reluctance to the ceremony.But I still wear that which
clings to me.My wealth is still my own, and I thank Heaven it is a
decent pittance whereon to live; my life, too, is that of a hale old man
of sixty, who is in no haste to bring it to a close; and if I were
poor as Job and on the edge of the grave, must I not still cling to my
daughter, whom your doctrines have already cost so dear?""Thy daughter, friend Simon," said the Carmelite [Carthusian], "may be
truly called an angel upon earth.""Ay, and by listening to your doctrines, father, she is now like to be
called on to be an angel in heaven, and to be transported thither in a
chariot of fire.""Nay, my good brother," said Clement, "desist, I pray you, to speak of
what you little understand.Since it is wasting time to show thee the
light that thou chafest against, yet listen to that which I have to say
touching thy daughter, whose temporal felicity, though I weigh it not
even for an instant in the scale against that which is spiritual, is,
nevertheless, in its order, as dear to Clement Blair as to her own
father."The tears stood in the old man's eyes as he spoke, and Simon Glover was
in some degree mollified as he again addressed him."One would think thee, Father Clement, the kindest and most amiable of
men; how comes it, then, that thy steps are haunted by general ill
will wherever thou chancest to turn them?I could lay my life thou hast
contrived already to offend yonder half score of poor friars in their
water girdled cage, and that you have been prohibited from attendance on
the funeral?""Even so, my son," said the Carthusian, "and I doubt whether their
malice will suffer me to remain in this country.I did but speak a few
sentences about the superstition and folly of frequenting St.Fillan's
church, to detect theft by means of his bell, of bathing mad patients in
his pool, to cure their infirmity of mind; and lo!the persecutors have
cast me forth of their communion, as they will speedily cast me out of
this life.""Lo you there now," said the glover, "see what it is for a man that
cannot take a warning!Well, Father Clement, men will not cast me forth
unless it were as a companion of yours.I pray you, therefore, tell me
what you have to say of my daughter, and let us be less neighbours than
we have been.""This, then, brother Simon, I have to acquaint you with.This young
chief, who is swoln with contemplation of his own power and glory, loves
one thing better than it all, and that is thy daughter.""My runagate apprentice look up to my
daughter!"said Clement, "how close sits our worldly pride, even as ivy
clings to the wall, and cannot be separated!Look up to thy daughter,
good Simon?The captain of Clan Quhele, great as he is, and
greater as he soon expects to be, looks down to the daughter of the
Perth burgess, and considers himself demeaned in doing so.But, to use
his own profane expression, Catharine is dearer to him than life here
and Heaven hereafter: he cannot live without her.""Then he may die, if he lists," said Simon Glover, "for she is betrothed
to an honest burgess of Perth; and I would not break my word to make my
daughter bride to the Prince of Scotland.""I thought it would be your answer," replied the monk; "I would, worthy
friend, thou couldst carry into thy spiritual concerns some part of that
daring and resolved spirit with which thou canst direct thy temporal
affairs.""Hush thee--hush, Father Clement!"answered the glover; "when thou
fallest into that vein of argument, thy words savour of blazing tar, and
that is a scent I like not.As to Catharine, I must manage as I can, so
as not to displease the young dignitary; but well is it for me that she
is far beyond his reach.""She must then be distant indeed," said the Carmelite [Carthusian]."And now, brother Simon, since you think it perilous to own me and my
opinions, I must walk alone with my own doctrines and the dangers they
draw on me.But should your eye, less blinded than it now is by worldly
hopes and fears, ever turn a glance back on him who soon may be snatched
from you, remember, that by nought save a deep sense of the truth and
importance of the doctrine which he taught could Clement Blair have
learned to encounter, nay, to provoke, the animosity of the powerful and
inveterate, to alarm the fears of the jealous and timid, to walk in the
world as he belonged not to it, and to be accounted mad of men, that he
might, if possible, win souls to God.Heaven be my witness, that I would
comply in all lawful things to conciliate the love and sympathy of my
fellow creatures!It is no light thing to be shunned by the worthy as
an infected patient, to be persecuted by the Pharisees of the day as an
unbelieving heretic, to be regarded with horror at once and contempt by
the multitude, who consider me as a madman, who may be expected to turn
mischievous.But were all those evils multiplied an hundredfold, the
fire within must not be stifled, the voice which says within me 'Speak'
must receive obedience.Woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel, even
should I at length preach it from amidst the pile of flames!"So spoke this bold witness, one of those whom Heaven raised up from time
to time to preserve amidst the most ignorant ages, and to carry down to
those which succeed them, a manifestation of unadulterated Christianity,
from the time of the Apostles to the age when, favoured by the invention
of printing, the Reformation broke out in full splendour.The selfish
policy of the glover was exposed in his own eyes; and he felt himself
contemptible as he saw the Carthusian turn from him in all the
hallowedness of resignation.He was even conscious of a momentary
inclination to follow the example of the preacher's philanthropy and
disinterested zeal, but it glanced like a flash of lightning through a
dark vault, where there lies nothing to catch the blaze; and he slowly
descended the hill in a direction different from that of the Carthusian,
forgetting him and his doctrines, and buried in anxious thoughts about
his child's fate and his own.What want these outlaws conquerors should have
     But history's purchased page to call them great,
     A wider space, an ornamented grave?Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.The funeral obsequies being over, the same flotilla which had proceeded
in solemn and sad array down the lake prepared to return with displayed
banners, and every demonstration of mirth and joy; for there was but
brief time to celebrate festivals when the awful conflict betwixt the
Clan Quhele and their most formidable rivals so nearly approached.It
had been agreed, therefore, that the funeral feast should be blended
with that usually given at the inauguration of the young chief.Some objections were made to this arrangement, as containing an evil
omen.But, on the other hand, it had a species of recommendation, from
the habits and feelings of the Highlanders, who, to this day, are wont
to mingle a degree of solemn mirth with their mourning, and something
resembling melancholy with their mirth.The usual aversion to speak
or think of those who have been beloved and lost is less known to this
grave and enthusiastic race than it is to others.You hear not only the
young mention (as is everywhere usual) the merits and the character of
parents, who have, in the course of nature, predeceased them; but the
widowed partner speaks, in ordinary conversation, of the lost spouse,
and, what is still stranger, the parents allude frequently to the beauty
or valour of the child whom they have interred.The Scottish Highlanders
appear to regard the separation of friends by death as something less
absolute and complete than it is generally esteemed in other countries,
and converse of the dear connexions who have sought the grave before
them as if they had gone upon a long journey in which they themselves
must soon follow.The funeral feast, therefore, being a general custom
throughout Scotland, was not, in the opinion of those who were to share
it, unseemingly mingled, on the present occasion, with the festivities
which hailed the succession to the chieftainship.The barge which had lately borne the dead to the grave now conveyed
the young MacIan to his new command and the minstrels sent forth their
gayest notes to gratulate Eachin's succession, as they had lately
sounded their most doleful dirges when carrying Gilchrist to his grave.From the attendant flotilla rang notes of triumph and jubilee, instead
of those yells of lamentation which had so lately disturbed the echoes
of Loch Tay; and a thousand voices hailed the youthful chieftain as he
stood on the poop, armed at all points, in the flower of early manhood,
beauty, and activity, on the very spot where his father's corpse had so
lately been extended, and surrounded by triumphant friends, as that had
been by desolate mourners.One boat kept closest of the flotilla to the honoured galley.Torquil
of the Oak, a grizzled giant, was steersman; and his eight sons, each
exceeding the ordinary stature of mankind, pulled the oars.Like some
powerful and favourite wolf hound, unloosed from his couples, and
frolicking around a liberal master, the boat of the foster brethren
passed the chieftain's barge, now on one side and now on another, and
even rowed around it, as if in extravagance of joy; while, at the same
time, with the jealous vigilance of the animal we have compared it to,
they made it dangerous for any other of the flotilla to approach so near
as themselves, from the risk of being run down by their impetuous
and reckless manoeuvres.Raised to an eminent rank in the clan by the
succession of their foster brother to the command of the Clan Quhele,
this was the tumultuous and almost terrible mode in which they testified
their peculiar share in their chief's triumph.Far behind, and with different feelings, on the part of one at least of
the company, came the small boat in which, manned by the Booshalloch and
one of his sons, Simon Glover was a passenger."If we are bound for the head of the lake," said Simon to his friend,
"we shall hardly be there for hours."But as he spoke the crew of the boat of the foster brethren, or
leichtach, on a signal from the chief's galley, lay on their oars until
the Booshalloch's boat came up, and throwing on board a rope of hides,
which Niel made fast to the head of his skiff, they stretched to their
oars once more, and, notwithstanding they had the small boat in tow,
swept through the lake with almost the same rapidity as before.The
skiff was tugged on with a velocity which seemed to hazard the pulling
her under water, or the separation of her head from her other timbers.Simon Glover saw with anxiety the reckless fury of their course, and the
bows of the boat occasionally brought within an inch or two of the level
of the water; and though his friend, Niel Booshalloch, assured him it
was all done in especial honour, he heartily wished his voyage might
have a safe termination.It had so, and much sooner than he apprehended;
for the place of festivity was not four miles distant from the
sepulchral island, being chosen to suit the chieftain's course, which
lay to the southeast, so soon as the banquet should be concluded.A
bay on the southern side of Loch Tay presented a beautiful beach of
sparkling sand, on which the boats might land with ease, and a dry
meadow, covered with turf, verdant considering the season, behind and
around which rose high banks, fringed with copsewood, and displaying the
lavish preparations which had been made for the entertainment.The Highlanders, well known for ready hatchet men, had constructed a
long arbour or silvan banqueting room, capable of receiving two hundred
men, while a number of smaller huts around seemed intended for sleeping
apartments.The uprights, the couples, and roof tree of the temporary
hall were composed of mountain pine, still covered with its bark.The
framework of the sides was of planks or spars of the same material,
closely interwoven with the leafy boughs of the fir and other
evergreens, which the neighbouring woods afforded, while the hills had
furnished plenty of heath to form the roof.Within this silvan palace
the most important personages present were invited to hold high
festival.Others of less note were to feast in various long sheds
constructed with less care; and tables of sod, or rough planks, placed
in the open air, were allotted to the numberless multitude.At a
distance were to be seen piles of glowing charcoal or blazing wood,
around which countless cooks toiled, bustled, and fretted, like so many
demons working in their native element.Pits, wrought in the hillside,
and lined with heated stones, served as ovens for stewing immense
quantities of beef, mutton, and venison; wooden spits supported sheep
and goats, which were roasted entire; others were cut into joints,
and seethed in caldrons made of the animal's own skins, sewed hastily
together and filled with water; while huge quantities of pike, trout,
salmon, and char were broiled with more ceremony on glowing embers.The
glover had seen many a Highland banquet, but never one the preparations
for which were on such a scale of barbarous profusion.He had little time, however, to admire the scene around him for, as
soon as they landed on the beach, the Booshalloch observed with some
embarrassment, that, as they had not been bidden to the table of the
dais, to which he seemed to have expected an invitation, they had best
secure a place in one of the inferior bothies or booths; and was leading
the way in that direction, when he was stopped by one of the bodyguards,
seeming to act as master of ceremonies, who whispered something in his
ear."I thought so," said the herdsman, much relieved--"I thought neither the
stranger nor the man that has my charge would be left out at the high
table."They were conducted accordingly into the ample lodge, within which were
long ranges of tables already mostly occupied by the guests, while those
who acted as domestics were placing upon them the abundant though rude
materials of the festival.The young chief, although he certainly saw
the glover and the herdsman enter, did not address any personal salute
to either, and their places were assigned them in a distant corner, far
beneath the salt, a huge piece of antique silver plate, the only article
of value that the table displayed, and which was regarded by the clan
as a species of palladium, only produced and used on the most solemn
occasions, such as the present.The Booshalloch, somewhat discontented, muttered to Simon as he took his
place: "These are changed days, friend.His father, rest his soul, would
have spoken to us both; but these are bad manners which he has learned
among you Sassenachs in the Low Country."To this remark the glover did not think it necessary to reply; instead
of which he adverted to the evergreens, and particularly to the skins
and other ornaments with which the interior of the bower was decorated.The most remarkable part of these ornaments was a number of Highland
shirts of mail, with steel bonnets, battle axes, and two handed swords
to match, which hung around the upper part of the room, together with
targets highly and richly embossed.Each mail shirt was hung over a well
dressed stag's hide, which at once displayed the armour to advantage and
saved it from suffering by damp."These," whispered the Booshalloch, "are the arms of the chosen
champions of the Clan Quhele.They are twenty-nine in number, as you
see, Eachin himself being the thirtieth, who wears his armour today,
else had there been thirty.And he has not got such a good hauberk after
all as he should wear on Palm Sunday.These nine suits of harness, of
such large size, are for the leichtach, from whom so much is expected.""And these goodly deer hides," said Simon, the spirit of his profession
awakening at the sight of the goods in which he traded--"think you the
chief will be disposed to chaffer for them?They are in demand for the
doublets which knights wear under their armour.""Did I not pray you," said Niel Booshalloch, "to say nothing on that
subject?""It is the mail shirts I speak of," said Simon--"may I ask if any of
them were made by our celebrated Perth armourer, called Henry of the
Wynd?""Thou art more unlucky than before," said Niel, "that man's name is to
Eachin's temper like a whirlwind upon the lake; yet no man knows for
what cause.""I can guess," thought our glover, but gave no utterance to the thought;
and, having twice lighted on unpleasant subjects of conversation, he
prepared to apply himself, like those around him, to his food, without
starting another topic.We have said as much of the preparations as may lead the reader to
conclude that the festival, in respect of the quality of the food, was
of the most rude description, consisting chiefly of huge joints of meat,
which were consumed with little respect to the fasting season, although
several of the friars of the island convent graced and hallowed the
board by their presence.The platters were of wood, and so were the
hooped cogues or cups out of which the guests quaffed their liquor, as
also the broth or juice of the meat, which was held a delicacy.There
were also various preparations of milk which were highly esteemed, and
were eaten out of similar vessels.Bread was the scarcest article at the
banquet, but the glover and his patron Niel were served with two small
loaves expressly for their own use.In eating, as, indeed, was then the
case all over Britain, the guests used their knives called skenes, or
the large poniards named dirks, without troubling themselves by the
reflection that they might occasionally have served different or more
fatal purposes.At the upper end of the table stood a vacant seat, elevated a step or
two above the floor.It was covered with a canopy of hollow boughs and
ivy, and there rested against it a sheathed sword and a folded banner.This had been the seat of the deceased chieftain, and was left vacant
in honour of him.Eachin occupied a lower chair on the right hand of the
place of honour.The reader would be greatly mistaken who should follow out this
description by supposing that the guests behaved like a herd of hungry
wolves, rushing upon a feast rarely offered to them.On the contrary,
the Clan Quhele conducted themselves with that species of courteous
reserve and attention to the wants of others which is often found in
primitive nations, especially such as are always in arms, because a
general observance of the rules of courtesy is necessary to prevent
quarrels, bloodshed, and death.The guests took the places assigned them
by Torquil of the Oak, who, acting as marischal taeh, i.e.sewer of
the mess, touched with a white wand, without speaking a word, the place
where each was to sit.Thus placed in order, the company patiently
waited for the portion assigned them, which was distributed among them
by the leichtach; the bravest men or more distinguished warriors of
the tribe being accommodated with a double mess, emphatically called
bieyfir, or the portion of a man.When the sewers themselves had seen
every one served, they resumed their places at the festival, and were
each served with one of these larger messes of food.Water was placed
within each man's reach, and a handful of soft moss served the purposes
of a table napkin, so that, as at an Eastern banquet, the hands were
washed as often as the mess was changed.For amusement, the bard recited
the praises of the deceased chief, and expressed the clan's confidence
in the blossoming virtues of his successor.The seannachie recited the
genealogy of the tribe, which they traced to the race of the Dalriads;
the harpers played within, while the war pipes cheered the multitude
without.The conversation among the guests was grave, subdued, and
civil; no jest was attempted beyond the bounds of a very gentle
pleasantry, calculated only to excite a passing smile.There were no
raised voices, no contentious arguments; and Simon Glover had heard a
hundred times more noise at a guild feast in Perth than was made on this
occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers.Even the liquor itself did not seem to raise the festive party above the
same tone of decorous gravity.Wine appeared in
very small quantities, and was served out only to the principal guests,
among which honoured number Simon Glover was again included.The wine
and the two wheaten loaves were indeed the only marks of notice which he
received during the feast; but Niel Booshalloch, jealous of his master's
reputation for hospitality, failed not to enlarge on them as proofs
of high distinction.Distilled liquors, since so generally used in
the Highlands, were then comparatively unknown.The usquebaugh was
circulated in small quantities, and was highly flavoured with a
decoction of saffron and other herbs, so as to resemble a medicinal
potion rather than a festive cordial.Cider and mead were seen at the
entertainment, but ale, brewed in great quantities for the purpose, and
flowing round without restriction, was the liquor generally used, and
that was drunk with a moderation much less known among the more modern
Highlanders.A cup to the memory of the deceased chieftain was the first
pledge solemnly proclaimed after the banquet was finished, and a low
murmur of benedictions was heard from the company, while the monks
alone, uplifting their united voices, sung Requiem eternam dona.An
unusual silence followed, as if something extraordinary was expected,
when Eachin arose with a bold and manly, yet modest, grace, and ascended
the vacant seat or throne, saying with dignity and firmness:

"This seat and my father's inheritance I claim as my right--so prosper
me God and St."How will you rule your father's children?"said an old man, the uncle
of the deceased."I will defend them with my father's sword, and distribute justice to
them under my father's banner."The old man, with a trembling hand, unsheathed the ponderous weapon,
and, holding it by the blade, offered the hilt to the young chieftain's
grasp; at the same time Torquil of the Oak unfurled the pennon of the
tribe, and swung it repeatedly over Eachin's head, who, with singular
grace and dexterity, brandished the huge claymore as in its defence.The guests raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance of the
patriarchal chief who claimed their allegiance, nor was there any who,
in the graceful and agile youth before them, was disposed to recollect
the subject of sinister vaticinations.As he stood in glittering mail,
resting on the long sword, and acknowledging by gracious gestures the
acclamations which rent the air within, without, and around, Simon
Glover was tempted to doubt whether this majestic figure was that of the
same lad whom he had often treated with little ceremony, and began to
have some apprehension of the consequences of having done so.A
general burst of minstrelsy succeeded to the acclamations, and rock and
greenwood rang to harp and pipes, as lately to shout and yell of woe.It would be tedious to pursue the progress of the inaugural feast, or
detail the pledges that were quaffed to former heroes of the clan, and
above all to the twenty-nine brave galloglasses who were to fight in the
approaching conflict, under the eye and leading of their young chief.The bards, assuming in old times the prophetic character combined with
their own, ventured to assure them of the most distinguished victory,
and to predict the fury with which the blue falcon, the emblem of the
Clan Quhele, should rend to pieces the mountain cat, the well known
badge of the Clan Chattan.It was approaching sunset when a bowl, called the grace cup, made of
oak, hooped with silver, was handed round the table as the signal of
dispersion, although it was left free to any who chose a longer carouse
to retreat to any of the outer bothies.As for Simon Glover, the
Booshalloch conducted him to a small hut, contrived, it would seem,
for the use of a single individual, where a bed of heath and moss was
arranged as well as the season would permit, and an ample supply of
such delicacies as the late feast afforded showed that all care had been
taken for the inhabitant's accommodation."Do not leave this hut," said the Booshalloch, taking leave of his
friend and protege: "this is your place of rest.But apartments are lost
on such a night of confusion, and if the badger leaves his hole the toad
will creep into it."To Simon Glover this arrangement was by no means disagreeable.He had
been wearied by the noise of the day, and felt desirous of repose.After
eating, therefore, a morsel, which his appetite scarce required, and
drinking a cup of wine to expel the cold, he muttered his evening
prayer, wrapt himself in his cloak, and lay down on a couch which old
acquaintance had made familiar and easy to him.The hum and murmur,
and even the occasional shouts, of some of the festive multitude who
continued revelling without did not long interrupt his repose, and in
about ten minutes he was as fast asleep as if he had lain in his own bed
in Curfew Street.Two hours before the black cock crew, Simon Glover was wakened by a well
known voice, which called him by name.he replied, as he started from sleep, "is the morning
so far advanced?"and, raising his eyes, the person of whom he was
dreaming stood before him; and at the same moment, the events of
yesterday rushing on his recollection, he saw with surprise that the
vision retained the form which sleep had assigned it, and it was not the
mail clad Highland chief, with claymore in hand, as he had seen him
the preceding night, but Conachar of Curfew Street, in his humble
apprentice's garb, holding in his hand a switch of oak.An apparition
would not more have surprised our Perth burgher.As he gazed with
wonder, the youth turned upon him a piece of lighted bog wood which he
carried in a lantern, and to his waking exclamation replied:

"Even so, father Simon: it is Conachar, come to renew our old
acquaintance, when our intercourse will attract least notice."So saying, he sat down on a tressel which answered the purpose of
a chair, and placing the lantern beside him, proceeded in the most
friendly tone:

"I have tasted of thy good cheer many a day, father Simon; I trust thou
hast found no lack in my family?""None whatever, Eachin MacIan," answered the glover, for the simplicity
of the Celtic language and manners rejects all honorary titles; "it was
even too good for this fasting season, and much too good for me, since I
must be ashamed to think how hard you fared in Curfew Street.""Even too well, to use your own word," said Conachar, "for the deserts
of an idle apprentice and for the wants of a young Highlander.But
yesterday, if there was, as I trust, enough of food, found you not, good
glover, some lack of courteous welcome?Excuse it not--I know you did
so.But I am young in authority with my people, and I must not too early
draw their attention to the period of my residence in the Lowlands,
which, however, I can never forget.""I understand the cause entirely," said Simon; "and therefore it is
unwillingly, and as it were by force, that I have made so early a visit
hither."It is well you are come to see some of my Highland
splendour while it yet sparkles.Return after Palm Sunday, and who knows
whom or what you may find in the territories we now possess!The
wildcat may have made his lodge where the banqueting bower of MacIan now
stands."The young chief was silent, and pressed the top of the rod to his lips,
as if to guard against uttering more."There is no fear of that, Eachin," said Simon, in that vague way in
which lukewarm comforters endeavour to turn the reflections of their
friends from the consideration of inevitable danger."There is fear, and there is peril of utter ruin," answered Eachin, "and
there is positive certainty of great loss.I marvel my father consented
to this wily proposal of Albany.I would MacGillie Chattanach would
agree with me, and then, instead of wasting our best blood against
each other, we would go down together to Strathmore and kill and take
possession.I would rule at Perth and he at Dundee, and all the great
strath should be our own to the banks of the Firth of Tay.Such is the
policy I have caught from your old grey head, father Simon, when holding
a trencher at thy back, and listening to thy evening talk with Bailie
Craigdallie.""The tongue is well called an unruly member," thought the glover."Here have I been holding a candle to the devil, to show him the way to
mischief."But he only said aloud: "These plans come too late.""The indentures of battle are signed
by our marks and seals, the burning hate of the Clan Quhele and Clan
Chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable flame by mutual insults and
boasts.But to thine own affairs, father
Glover.It is religion that has brought thee hither, as I learn from
Niel Booshalloch.Surely, my experience of thy prudence did not lead
me to suspect thee of any quarrel with Mother Church.As for my old
acquaintance, Father Clement, he is one of those who hunt after the
crown of martyrdom, and think a stake, surrounded with blazing fagots,
better worth embracing than a willing bride.He is a very knight errant
in defence of his religious notions, and does battle wherever he comes.He hath already a quarrel with the monks of Sibyl's Isle yonder about
some point of doctrine."I have," answered Simon; "but we spoke little together, the time being
pressing.""He may have said that there is a third person--one more likely, I
think, to be a true fugitive for religion than either you, a shrewd
citizen, or he, a wrangling preacher--who would be right heartily
welcome to share our protection?Thou art dull, man, and wilt not guess
my meaning--thy daughter, Catharine."These last words the young chief spoke in English; and he continued the
conversation in that language, as if apprehensive of being overheard,
and, indeed, as if under the sense of some involuntary hesitation."My daughter Catharine," said the glover, remembering what the
Carthusian had told him, "is well and safe.""And wherefore came she
not with you?Think you the Clan Quhele have no cailliachs as active as
old Dorothy, whose hand has warmed my haffits before now, to wait upon
the daughter of their chieftain's master?""Again I thank you," said the glover, "and doubt neither your power nor
your will to protect my daughter, as well as myself.But an honourable
lady, the friend of Sir Patrick Charteris, hath offered her a safe place
of refuge without the risk of a toilsome journey through a desolate and
distracted country.""Oh, ay, Sir Patrick Charteris," said Eachin, in a more reserved and
distant tone; "he must be preferred to all men, without doubt.Simon Glover longed to punish this affectation of a boy who had been
scolded four times a day for running into the street to see Sir Patrick
Charteris ride past; but he checked his spirit of repartee, and simply
said:

"Sir Patrick Charteris has been provost of Perth for seven years, and it
is likely is so still, since the magistrates are elected, not in Lent,
but at St."Ah, father Glover," said the youth, in his kinder and more familiar
mode of address, "you are so used to see the sumptuous shows and
pageants of Perth, that you would but little relish our barbarous
festival in comparison.What didst thou think of our ceremonial of
yesterday?""It was noble and touching," said the glover; "and to me, who knew your
father, most especially so.When you rested on the sword and looked
around you, methought I saw mine old friend Gilchrist MacIan arisen from
the dead and renewed in years and in strength.""I played my part there boldly, I trust; and showed little of that
paltry apprentice boy whom you used to--use just as he deserved?""Eachin resembles Conachar," said the glover, "no more than a salmon
resembles a gar, though men say they are the same fish in a different
state, or than a butterfly resembles a grub.""Thinkest thou that, while I was taking upon me the power which all
women love, I would have been myself an object for a maiden's eye to
rest upon?To speak plain, what would Catharine have thought of me in
the ceremonial?""We approach the shallows now," thought Simon Glover, "and without nice
pilotage we drive right on shore.""Most women like show, Eachin; but I think my daughter Catharine be an
exception.She would rejoice in the good fortune of her household friend
and playmate; but she would not value the splendid MacIan, captain of
Clan Quhele, more than the orphan Conachar.""She is ever generous and disinterested," replied the young chief."But
yourself, father, have seen the world for many more years than she has
done, and can better form a judgment what power and wealth do for those
who enjoy them.Think, and speak sincerely, what would be your own
thoughts if you saw your Catharine standing under yonder canopy, with
the command over an hundred hills, and the devoted obedience of ten
thousand vassals; and as the price of these advantages, her hand in that
of the man who loves her the best in the world?""Meaning in your own, Conachar?""Ay, Conachar call me: I love the name, since it was by that I have been
known to Catharine.""Sincerely, then," said the glover, endeavouring to give the least
offensive turn to his reply, "my inmost thought would be the earnest
wish that Catharine and I were safe in our humble booth in Curfew
Street, with Dorothy for our only vassal.""And with poor Conachar also, I trust?You would not leave him to pine
away in solitary grandeur?""I would not," answered the glover, "wish so ill to the Clan Quhele,
mine ancient friends, as to deprive them, at the moment of emergency,
of a brave young chief, and that chief of the fame which he is about to
acquire at their head in the approaching conflict."Eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated feelings as he replied:
"Words--words--empty words, father Simon.You fear the Clan Quhele
more than you love them, and you suppose their indignation would be
formidable should their chief marry the daughter of a burgess of Perth.""And if I do fear such an issue, Hector MacIan, have I not reason?How
have ill assorted marriages had issue in the house of MacCallanmore,
in that of the powerful MacLeans--nay, of the Lords of the Isles
themselves?What has ever come of them but divorce and exheredation,
sometimes worse fate, to the ambitious intruder?You could not marry my
child before a priest, and you could only wed her with your left
hand; and I--" he checked the strain of impetuosity which the subject
inspired, and concluded, "and I am an honest though humble burgher of
Perth, who would rather my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse of
a citizen in my own rank than the licensed concubine of a monarch.""I will wed Catharine before the priest and before the world, before
the altar and before the black stones of Iona," said the impetuous young
man."She is the love of my youth, and there is not a tie in religion or
honour but I will bind myself by them!If
we do but win this combat--and, with the hope of gaining Catharine, we
SHALL win it--my heart tells me so--I shall be so much lord over their
affections that, were I to take a bride from the almshouse, so it was
my pleasure, they would hail her as if she were a daughter of
MacCallanmore."You put words of offence in my mouth," said the old man, "and may next
punish me for them, since I am wholly in your power.But with my consent
my daughter shall never wed save in her own degree.Her heart would
break amid the constant wars and scenes of bloodshed which connect
themselves with your lot.If you really love her, and recollect her
dread of strife and combat, you would not wish her to be subjected to
the train of military horrors in which you, like your father, must
needs be inevitably and eternally engaged.Choose a bride amongst the
daughters of the mountain chiefs, my son, or fiery Lowland nobles.You
are fair, young, rich, high born, and powerful, and will not woo in
vain.You will readily find one who will rejoice in your conquests, and
cheer you under defeat.To Catharine, the one would be as frightful
as the other.A warrior must wear a steel gauntlet: a glove of kidskin
would be torn to pieces in an hour."A dark cloud passed over the face of the young chief, lately animated
with so much fire."Farewell," he said, "the only hope which could have lighted me to fame
or victory!"He remained for a space silent, and intensely thoughtful, with downcast
eyes, a lowering brow, and folded arms.At length he raised his hands,
and said: "Father,--for such you have been to me--I am about to tell you
a secret.Reason and pride both advise me to be silent, but fate urges
me, and must be obeyed.I am about to lodge in you the deepest and
dearest secret that man ever confided to man.But beware--end this
conference how it will--beware how you ever breathe a syllable of what
I am now to trust to you; for know that, were you to do so in the most
remote corner of Scotland, I have ears to hear it even there, and a
hand and poniard to reach a traitor's bosom.I am--but the word will not
out!""Do not speak it then," said the prudent glover: "a secret is no longer
safe when it crosses the lips of him who owns it, and I desire not a
confidence so dangerous as you menace me with.""Ay, but I must speak, and you must hear," said the youth."In this age
of battle, father, you have yourself been a combatant?""Once only," replied Simon, "when the Southron assaulted the Fair City.I was summoned to take my part in the defence, as my tenure required,
like that of other craftsmen, who are bound to keep watch and ward.""What can that import to the present business?""Much, else I had not asked the question," answered.Eachin, in the tone
of haughtiness which from time to time he assumed."An old man is easily brought to speak of olden times," said Simon, not
unwilling, on an instant's reflection, to lead the conversation away
from the subject of his daughter, "and I must needs confess my feelings
were much short of the high, cheerful confidence, nay, the pleasure,
with which I have seen other men go to battle.My life and profession
were peaceful, and though I have not wanted the spirit of a man, when
the time demanded it, yet I have seldom slept worse than the night
before that onslaught.My ideas were harrowed by the tales we were
told--nothing short of the truth--about the Saxon archers: how they drew
shafts of a cloth yard length, and used bows a third longer than ours.When I fell into a broken slumber, if but a straw in the mattress
pricked my side I started and waked, thinking an English arrow was
quivering in my body.In the morning, as I began for very weariness to
sink into some repose, I was waked by the tolling of the common bell,
which called us burghers to the walls; I never heard its sound peal so
like a passing knell before or since.""I did on my harness," said Simon, "such as it was; took my mother's
blessing, a high spirited woman, who spoke of my father's actions for
the honour of the Fair Town.This heartened me, and I felt still bolder
when I found myself ranked among the other crafts, all bowmen, for thou
knowest the Perth citizens have good skill in archery.We were dispersed
on the walls, several knights and squires in armour of proof being
mingled amongst us, who kept a bold countenance, confident perhaps in
their harness, and informed us, for our encouragement, that they would
cut down with their swords and axes any of those who should attempt to
quit their post.I was kindly assured of this myself by the old Kempe
of Kinfauns, as he was called, this good Sir Patrick's father, then our
provost.He was a grandson of the Red Rover, Tom of Longueville, and
a likely man to keep his word, which he addressed to me in especial,
because a night of much discomfort may have made me look paler than
usual; and, besides, I was but a lad.""And did his exhortation add to your fear or your resolution?"said
Eachin, who seemed very attentive."To my resolution," answered Simon; "for I think nothing can make a
man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the
knowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward.Well, I
mounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the
Spey Tower, being accounted a good bowman.But a very cold fit seized me
as I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front,
and their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong
columns, three in number.They came on steadily, and some of us would
fain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were
obliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement
as we best might.As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines,
each man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover
themselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before
them, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home
for a glass of distilled waters.But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy
Kempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he
should waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English
were in presence; so I e'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable
angle, formed by two battlements.The English then strode forward, and
drew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but
to the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could
call on St.I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I
believe I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet.But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town
crier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took
heart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim.A
little man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target,
dropt with a shaft through his shoulder.The provost cried, 'Well
stitched, Simon Glover!'John, for his own town, my fellow
craftsmen!'shouted I, though I was then but an apprentice.And if you
will believe me, in the rest of the skirmish, which was ended by the
foes drawing off, I drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if
I had been shooting at butts instead of men's breasts.I gained
some credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of
necessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not
have lost it again.And this is all I can tell of warlike experience in
battle.Other dangers I have had, which I have endeavoured to avoid like
a wise man, or, when they were inevitable, I have faced them like a
true one.Upon other terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
Scotland.""I understand your tale," said Eachin; "but I shall find it difficult
to make you credit mine, knowing the race of which I am descended, and
especially that I am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the
tomb--well that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to
hear!Look, my father, the light which I bear grows short and pale, a
few minutes will extinguish it; but before it expires, the hideous tale
will be told.Father, I am--a COWARD!It is said at last, and the secret
of my disgrace is in keeping of another!"The young man sunk back in a species of syncope, produced by the agony
of his mind as he made the fatal communication.The glover, moved as
well by fear as by compassion, applied himself to recall him to life,
and succeeded in doing so, but not in restoring him to composure.He hid
his face with his hands, and his tears flowed plentifully and bitterly."For Our Lady's sake, be composed," said the old man, "and recall the
vile word!I know you better than yourself: you are no coward, but only
too young and inexperienced, ay, and somewhat too quick of fancy, to
have the steady valour of a bearded man.I would hear no other man say
that of you, Conachar, without giving him the lie.You are no coward:
I have seen high sparks of spirit fly from you even on slight enough
provocation."said the unfortunate youth; "but
when saw you them supported by the resolution that should have backed
them?The sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as on a piece
of ice which could catch fire from nothing: if my offended pride urged
me to strike, my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly.""Want of habit," said Simon; "it is by clambering over walls that youths
learn to scale precipices.Begin with slight feuds; exercise daily the
arms of your country in tourney with your followers."exclaimed the young chief,
starting as if something horrid had occurred to his imagination."How
many days are there betwixt this hour and Palm Sunday, and what is to
chance then?A list inclosed, from which no man can stir, more than the
poor bear who is chained to his stake.Sixty living men, the best
and fiercest--one alone excepted!--which Albyn can send down from her
mountains, all athirst for each other's blood, while a king and his
nobles, and shouting thousands besides, attend, as at a theatre, to
encourage their demoniac fury!Blows clang and blood flows, thicker,
faster, redder; they rush on each other like madmen, they tear each
other like wild beasts; the wounded are trodden to death amid the feet
of their companions!Blood ebbs, arms become weak; but there must be
no parley, no truce, no interruption, while any of the maimed wretches
remain alive!Here is no crouching behind battlements, no fighting with
missile weapons: all is hand to hand, till hands can no longer be raised
to maintain the ghastly conflict!If such a field is so horrible in
idea, what think you it will be in reality?""I can only pity you, Conachar," said Simon."It is hard to be the
descendant of a lofty line--the son of a noble father--the leader by
birth of a gallant array, and yet to want, or think you want, for
still I trust the fault lies much in a quick fancy, that over estimates
danger--to want that dogged quality which is possessed by every game
cock that is worth a handful of corn, every hound that is worth a
mess of offal.But how chanced it that, with such a consciousness of
inability to fight in this battle, you proffered even now to share your
chiefdom with my daughter?Your power must depend on your fighting this
combat, and in that Catharine cannot help you.""You mistake, old man," replied Eachin: "were Catharine to look kindly
on the earnest love I bear her, it would carry me against the front of
the enemies with the mettle of a war horse.Overwhelming as my sense
of weakness is, the feeling that Catharine looked on would give me
strength.Say yet--oh, say yet--she shall be mine if we gain the combat,
and not the Gow Chrom himself, whose heart is of a piece with his
anvil, ever went to battle so light as I shall do!One strong passion is
conquered by another."Cannot the recollection of your interest, your
honour, your kindred, do as much to stir your courage as the thoughts of
a brent browed lass?"You tell me but what I have told myself, but it is in vain," replied
Eachin, with a sigh."It is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous.Be it from constitution; be
it, as our Highland cailliachs will say, from the milk of the white
doe; be it from my peaceful education and the experience of your strict
restraint; be it, as you think, from an overheated fancy, which paints
danger yet more dangerous and ghastly than it is in reality, I cannot
tell.But I know my failing, and--yes, it must be said!--so sorely dread
that I cannot conquer it, that, could I have your consent to my wishes
on such terms, I would even here make a pause, renounce the rank I have
assumed, and retire into humble life.""What, turn glover at last, Conachar?""This beats the
legend of St.Nay--nay, your hand was not framed for that: you
shall spoil me no more doe skins.""Jest not," said Eachin, "I am serious.If I cannot labour, I will bring
wealth enough to live without it.They will proclaim me recreant with
horn and war pipe.Catharine will love me the better
that I have preferred the paths of peace to those of bloodshed, and
Father Clement shall teach us to pity and forgive the world, which will
load us with reproaches that wound not.I shall be the happiest of men;
Catharine will enjoy all that unbounded affection can confer upon her,
and will be freed from apprehension of the sights and sounds of horror
which your ill assorted match would have prepared for her; and you,
father Glover, shall occupy your chimney corner, the happiest and most
honoured man that ever--"

"Hold, Eachin--I prithee, hold," said the glover; "the fir light, with
which this discourse must terminate, burns very low, and I would speak
a word in my turn, and plain dealing is best.Though it may vex,
or perhaps enrage, you, let me end these visions by saying at once:
Catharine can never be yours.A glove is the emblem of faith, and a
man of my craft should therefore less than any other break his own.Catharine's hand is promised--promised to a man whom you may hate, but
whom you must honour--to Henry the armourer.The match is fitting by
degree, agreeable to their mutual wishes, and I have given my promise.It is best to be plain at once; resent my refusal as you will--I am
wholly in your power.The glover spoke thus decidedly, because he was aware from experience
that the very irritable disposition of his former apprentice yielded in
most cases to stern and decided resolution.Yet, recollecting where he
was, it was with some feelings of fear that he saw the dying flame leap
up and spread a flash of light on the visage of Eachin, which seemed
pale as the grave, while his eye rolled like that of a maniac in his
fever fit.The light instantly sunk down and died, and Simon felt a
momentary terror lest he should have to dispute for his life with
the youth, whom he knew to be capable of violent actions when highly
excited, however short a period his nature could support the measures
which his passion commenced.He was relieved by the voice of Eachin, who
muttered in a hoarse and altered tone:

"Let what we have spoken this night rest in silence for ever.If thou
bring'st it to light, thou wert better dig thine own grave."Thus speaking, the door of the hut opened, admitting a gleam of
moonshine.The form of the retiring chief crossed it for an instant, the
hurdle was then closed, and the shieling left in darkness.Simon Glover felt relieved when a conversation fraught with offence and
danger was thus peaceably terminated.But he remained deeply affected by
the condition of Hector MacIan, whom he had himself bred up."The poor child," said he, "to be called up to a place of eminence,
only to be hurled from it with contempt!What he told me I partly knew,
having often remarked that Conachar was more prone to quarrel than to
fight.But this overpowering faint heartedness, which neither shame
nor necessity can overcome, I, though no Sir William Wallace, cannot
conceive.And to propose himself for a husband to my daughter, as if
a bride were to find courage for herself and the bridegroom!No--no,
Catharine must wed a man to whom she may say, 'Husband, spare your
enemy'--not one in whose behalf she must cry, 'Generous enemy, spare my
husband!"Tired out with these reflections, the old man at length fell asleep.In the morning he was awakened by his friend the Booshalloch, who, with
something of a blank visage, proposed to him to return to his abode on
the meadow at the Ballough.He apologised that the chief could not see
Simon Glover that morning, being busied with things about the expected
combat; and that Eachin MacIan thought the residence at the Ballough
would be safest for Simon Glover's health, and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection and accommodation.Niel Booshalloch dilated on these circumstances, to gloss over the
neglect implied in the chief's dismissing his visitor without a
particular audience."His father knew better," said the herdsman."But where should he have
learned manners, poor thing, and bred up among your Perth burghers, who,
excepting yourself, neighbour Glover, who speak Gaelic as well as I do,
are a race incapable of civility?"Simon Glover, it may be well believed, felt none of the want of respect
which his friend resented on his account.On the contrary, he greatly
preferred the quiet residence of the good herdsman to the tumultuous
hospitality of the daily festival of the chief, even if there had not
just passed an interview with Eachin upon a subject which it would be
most painful to revive.To the Ballough, therefore, he quietly retreated, where, could he have
been secure of Catharine's safety, his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough.His amusement was sailing on the lake in a little skiff, which a
Highland boy managed, while the old man angled.He frequently landed
on the little island, where he mused over the tomb of his old friend
Gilchrist MacIan, and made friends with the monks, presenting the prior
with gloves of martens' fur, and the superior officers with each of them
a pair made from the skin of the wildcat.The cutting and stitching of
these little presents served to beguile the time after sunset, while
the family of the herdsman crowded around, admiring his address, and
listening to the tales and songs with which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening.It must be confessed that the cautious glover avoided the conversation
of Father Clement, whom he erroneously considered as rather the author
of his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer of them."I will not," he
thought, "to please his fancies, lose the goodwill of these kind
monks, which may be one day useful to me.I have suffered enough by his
preachments already, I trow.Little the wiser and much the poorer they
have made me.No--no, Catharine and Clement may think as they will; but
I will take the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated hound at
the call of his master, submit to a plentiful course of haircloth and
whipcord, disburse a lusty mulct, and become whole with the church
again."More than a fortnight had passed since the glover had arrived at
Ballough, and he began to wonder that he had not heard news of Catharine
or of Henry Wynd, to whom he concluded the provost had communicated the
plan and place of his retreat.He knew the stout smith dared not come
up into the Clan Quhele country, on account of various feuds with
the inhabitants, and with Eachin himself, while bearing the name of
Conachar; but yet the glover thought Henry might have found means to
send him a message, or a token, by some one of the various couriers who
passed and repassed between the court and the headquarters of the Clan
Quhele, in order to concert the terms of the impending combat, the
march of the parties to Perth, and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment.It was now the middle of March, and the fatal Palm Sunday
was fast approaching.Whilst time was thus creeping on, the exiled glover had not even once
set eyes upon his former apprentice.The care that was taken to attend
to his wants and convenience in every respect showed that he was not
forgotten; but yet, when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing through
the woods, he usually made it a point to choose his walk in a different
direction.One morning, however, he found himself unexpectedly in
Eachin's close neighbourhood, with scarce leisure to avoid him, and thus
it happened.As Simon strolled pensively through a little silvan glade, surrounded
on either side with tall forest trees, mixed with underwood, a white doe
broke from the thicket, closely pursued by two deer greyhounds, one
of which griped her haunch, the other her throat, and pulled her down
within half a furlong of the glover, who was something startled at the
suddenness of the incident.The ear and piercing blast of a horn, and
the baying of a slow hound, made Simon aware that the hunters were close
behind, and on the trace of the deer.Hallooing and the sound of
men running through the copse were heard close at hand.A moment's
recollection would have satisfied Simon that his best way was to stand
fast, or retire slowly, and leave it to Eachin to acknowledge his
presence or not, as he should see cause.But his desire of shunning the
young man had grown into a kind of instinct, and in the alarm of finding
him so near, Simon hid himself in a bush of hazels mixed with holly,
which altogether concealed him.He had hardly done so ere Eachin, rosy
with exercise, dashed from the thicket into the open glade, accompanied
by his foster father, Torquil of the Oak.The latter, with equal
strength and address, turned the struggling hind on her back, and
holding her forefeet in his right hand, while he knelt on her body,
offered his skene with the left to the young chief, that he might cut
the animal's throat."It may not be, Torquil; do thine office, and take the assay thyself.I
must not kill the likeness of my foster--"

This was spoken with a melancholy smile, while a tear at the same time
stood in the speaker's eye.Torquil stared at his young chief for an
instant, then drew his sharp wood knife across the creature's throat
with a cut so swift and steady that the weapon reached the backbone.Then rising on his feet, and again fixing a long piercing look on his
chief, he said: "As much as I have done to that hind would I do to any
living man whose ears could have heard my dault (foster son) so much as
name a white doe, and couple the word with Hector's name!"If Simon had no reason before to keep himself concealed, this speech of
Torquil furnished him with a pressing one."It cannot be concealed, father Torquil," said Eachin: "it will all out
to the broad day.""It is the fatal secret," thought Simon; "and now, if this huge privy
councillor cannot keep silence, I shall be made answerable, I suppose,
for Eachin's disgrace having been blown abroad."Thinking thus anxiously, he availed himself at the same time of his
position to see as much as he could of what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confidant, impelled by that spirit of curiosity which
prompts us in the most momentous, as well as the most trivial, occasions
of life, and which is sometimes found to exist in company with great
personal fear.As Torquil listened to what Eachin communicated, the young man sank
into his arms, and, supporting himself on his shoulder, concluded his
confession by a whisper into his ear.Torquil seemed to listen with such
amazement as to make him incapable of crediting his ears.As if to be
certain that it was Eachin who spoke, he gradually roused the youth from
his reclining posture, and, holding him up in some measure by a grasp on
his shoulder, fixed on him an eye that seemed enlarged, and at the same
time turned to stone, by the marvels he listened to.And so wild waxed
the old man's visage after he had heard the murmured communication,
that Simon Glover apprehended he would cast the youth from him as a
dishonoured thing, in which case he might have lighted among the very
copse in which he lay concealed, and occasioned his discovery in a
manner equally painful and dangerous.But the passions of Torquil,
who entertained for his foster child even a double portion of that
passionate fondness which always attends that connexion in the Highlands
took a different turn."I believe it not," he exclaimed; "it is false of thy father's child,
false of thy mother's son, falsest of my dault!I offer my gage to
heaven and hell, and will maintain the combat with him that shall call
it true.Thou hast been spellbound by an evil eye, my darling, and the
fainting which you call cowardice is the work of magic.I remember the
bat that struck the torch out on the hour that thou wert born--that hour
of grief and of joy.Thou shalt with me to Iona,
and the good St.Columbus, with the whole choir of blessed saints and
angels, who ever favoured thy race, shall take from thee the heart of
the white doe and return that which they have stolen from thee."Eachin listened, with a look as if he would fain have believed the words
of the comforter."But, Torquil," he said, "supposing this might avail us, the fatal day
approaches, and if I go to the lists, I dread me we shall be shamed.""Hell shall not prevail so
far: we will steep thy sword in holy water, place vervain, St.John's
Wort, and rowan tree in thy crest.We will surround thee, I and thy
eight brethren: thou shalt be safe as in a castle."Again the youth helplessly uttered something, which, from the dejected
tone in which it was spoken, Simon could not understand, while Torquil's
deep tones in reply fell full and distinct upon his ear."Yes, there may be a chance of withdrawing thee from the conflict.Thou
art the youngest who is to draw blade.Now, hear me, and thou shalt know
what it is to have a foster father's love, and how far it exceeds the
love even of kinsmen.The youngest on the indenture of the Clan Chattan
is Ferquhard Day.His father slew mine, and the red blood is seething
hot between us; I looked to Palm Sunday as the term that should cool it.Thou wouldst have thought that the blood in the veins of this
Ferquhard Day and in mine would not have mingled had they been put into
the same vessel, yet hath he cast the eyes of his love upon my only
daughter Eva, the fairest of our maidens.Think with what feelings I
heard the news.It was as if a wolf from the skirts of Farragon had
said, 'Give me thy child in wedlock, Torquil.'My child thought not
thus: she loves Ferquhard, and weeps away her colour and strength in
dread of the approaching battle.Let her give him but a sign of favour,
and well I know he will forget kith and kin, forsake the field, and fly
with her to the desert.""He, the youngest of the champions of Clan Chattan, being absent, I, the
youngest of the Clan Quhele, may be excused from combat" said Eachin,
blushing at the mean chance of safety thus opened to him."See now, my chief;" said Torquil, "and judge my thoughts towards
thee: others might give thee their own lives and that of their sons--I
sacrifice to thee the honour of my house.""My friend--my father," repeated the chief, folding Torquil to his
bosom, "what a base wretch am I that have a spirit dastardly enough to
avail myself of your sacrifice!"Let us back to the camp, and
send our gillies for the venison.The slowhound, or lyme dog, luckily for Simon, had drenched his nose in
the blood of the deer, else he might have found the glover's lair in the
thicket; but its more acute properties of scent being lost, it followed
tranquilly with the gazehounds.When the hunters were out of sight and hearing, the glover arose,
greatly relieved by their departure, and began to move off in the
opposite direction as fast as his age permitted.His first reflection
was on the fidelity of the foster father."The wild mountain heart is faithful and true.Yonder man is more like
the giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves; and yet
Christians might take an example from him for his lealty.A simple
contrivance this, though, to finger a man from off their enemies'
chequer, as if there would not be twenty of the wildcats ready to supply
his place."Thus thought the glover, not aware that the strictest proclamations
were issued, prohibiting any of the two contending clans, their friends,
allies, and dependants, from coming within fifty miles of Perth, during
a week before and a week after the combat, which regulation was to be
enforced by armed men.So soon as our friend Simon arrived at the habitation of the herdsman,
he found other news awaiting him.They were brought by Father Clement,
who came in a pilgrim's cloak, or dalmatic, ready to commence his return
to the southward, and desirous to take leave of his companion in exile,
or to accept him as a travelling companion."But what," said the citizen, "has so suddenly induced you to return
within the reach of danger?""Have you not heard," said Father Clement, "that, March and his English
allies having retired into England before the Earl of Douglas, the good
earl has applied himself to redress the evils of the commonwealth, and
hath written to the court letters desiring that the warrant for the High
Court of Commission against heresy be withdrawn, as a trouble to men's
consciences, that the nomination of Henry of Wardlaw to be prelate of
St.Andrews be referred to the Parliament, with sundry other things
pleasing to the Commons?Now, most of the nobles that are with the King
at Perth, and with them Sir Patrick Charteris, your worthy provost, have
declared for the proposals of the Douglas.The Duke of Albany had agreed
to them--whether from goodwill or policy I know not.The good King is
easily persuaded to mild and gentle courses.And thus are the jaw
teeth of the oppressors dashed to pieces in their sockets, and the prey
snatched from their ravening talons.Will you with me to the Lowlands,
or do you abide here a little space?"Neil Booshalloch saved his friend the trouble of reply."He had the chief's authority," he said, "for saying that Simon Glover
should abide until the champions went down to the battle."In this answer the citizen saw something not quite consistent with his
own perfect freedom of volition; but he cared little for it at the
time, as it furnished a good apology for not travelling along with the
clergyman."An exemplary man," he said to his friend Niel Booshalloch, as soon as
Father Clement had taken leave--"a great scholar and a great saint.It
is a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned, as his sermon
at the stake would convert thousands.O Niel Booshalloch, Father
Clement's pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to
all decent Christians!But what would the burning of a borrel ignorant
burgess like me serve?Men offer not up old glove leather for incense,
nor are beacons fed with undressed hides, I trow.Sooth to speak, I have
too little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair, and,
therefore, I should, in our homely phrase, have both the scathe and the
scorn.""True for you," answered the herdsman.We must return to the characters of our dramatic narrative whom we
     left at Perth, when we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
     to Kinfauns, and from that hospitable mansion traced the course of
     Simon to Loch Tay; and the Prince, as the highest personage, claims
     our immediate attention.This rash and inconsiderate young man endured with some impatience his
sequestered residence with the Lord High Constable, with whose company,
otherwise in every respect satisfactory, he became dissatisfied, from
no other reason than that he held in some degree the character of his
warder.Incensed against his uncle and displeased with his father, he
longed, not unnaturally, for the society of Sir John Ramorny, on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself for amusement, and, though
he would have resented the imputation as an insult, for guidance and
direction.He therefore sent him a summons to attend him, providing his
health permitted; and directed him to come by water to a little pavilion
in the High Constable's garden, which, like that of Sir John's own
lodgings, ran down to the Tay.In renewing an intimacy so dangerous,
Rothsay only remembered that he had been Sir Join Ramorny's munificent
friend; while Sir John, on receiving the invitation, only recollected,
on his part, the capricious insults he had sustained from his patron,
the loss of his hand, and the lightness with which he had treated the
subject, and the readiness with which Rothsay had abandoned his cause in
the matter of the bonnet maker's slaughter.He laughed bitterly when he
read the Prince's billet."Eviot," he said, "man a stout boat with six trusty men--trusty men,
mark me--lose not a moment, and bid Dwining instantly come hither."Heaven smiles on us, my trusty friend," he said to the mediciner."I
was but beating my brains how to get access to this fickle boy, and here
he sends to invite me."I see the matter very clearly," said Dwining."Heaven smiles on
some untoward consequences--he!"No matter, the trap is ready; and it is baited, too, my friend, with
what would lure the boy from a sanctuary, though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard.His own weariness of himself would have done the job.Get thy matters
ready--thou goest with us.Write to him, as I cannot, that we come
instantly to attend his commands, and do it clerkly.He reads well, and
that he owes to me.""He will be your valiancie's debtor for more knowledge before he
dies--he!But is your bargain sure with the Duke of Albany?""Enough to gratify my ambition, thy avarice, and the revenge of both.Aboard--aboard, and speedily; let Eviot throw in a few flasks of the
choicest wine, and some cold baked meats.""But your arm, my lord, Sir John?"The throbbing of my heart silences the pain of my wound.It beats as it
would burst my bosom."said Dwining; adding, in a low voice--"It would be a
strange sight if it should.I should like to dissect it, save that its
stony case would spoil my best instruments."In a few minutes they were in the boat, while a speedy messenger carried
the note to the Prince.Rothsay was seated with the Constable, after their noontide repast.He
was sullen and silent; and the earl had just asked whether it was his
pleasure that the table should be cleared, when a note, delivered to the
Prince, changed at once his aspect."I go to the pavilion in the garden--always
with permission of my Lord Constable--to receive my late master of the
horse.""Ay, my lord; must I ask permission twice?""No, surely, my lord," answered the Constable; "but has your Royal
Highness recollected that Sir John Ramorny--"

"Has not the plague, I hope?""Come, Errol,
you would play the surly turnkey, but it is not in your nature; farewell
for half an hour."said Errol, as the Prince, flinging open a lattice of
the ground parlour in which they sat, stept out into the garden--"a new
folly, to call back that villain to his counsels.The Prince, in the mean time, looked back, and said hastily:

"Your lordship's good housekeeping will afford us a flask or two of
wine and a slight collation in the pavilion?I love the al fresco of the
river."The Constable bowed, and gave the necessary orders; so that Sir John
found the materials of good cheer ready displayed, when, landing from
his barge, he entered the pavilion."It grieves my heart to see your Highness under restraint," said
Ramorny, with a well executed appearance of sympathy."That grief of thine will grieve mine," said the Prince."I am sure here
has Errol, and a right true hearted lord he is, so tired me with grave
looks, and something like grave lessons, that he has driven me back to
thee, thou reprobate, from whom, as I expect nothing good, I may perhaps
obtain something entertaining.Yet, ere we say more, it was foul work,
that upon the Fastern's Even, Ramorny.I well hope thou gavest not aim
to it.""On my honour, my lord, a simple mistake of the brute Bonthron.I did
hint to him that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by whom I had
lost a hand; and lo you, my knave makes a double mistake.He takes one
man for another, and instead of the baton he uses the axe.""It is well that it went no farther.Small matter for the bonnet maker;
but I had never forgiven you had the armourer fallen--there is not his
match in Britain.But I hope they hanged the villain high enough?""If thirty feet might serve," replied Ramorny.no more of him," said Rothsay; "his wretched name makes the good
wine taste of blood.And what are the news in Perth, Ramorny?How stands
it with the bona robas and the galliards?""Little galliardise stirring, my lord," answered the knight."All eyes
are turned to the motions of the Black Douglas, who comes with five
thousand chosen men to put us all to rights, as if he were bound for
another Otterburn.It is said he is to be lieutenant again.It is
certain many have declared for his faction.""It is time, then, my feet were free," said Rothsay, "otherwise I may
find a worse warder than Errol."were you once away from this place, you might make as bold
a head as Douglas.""Ramorny," said the Prince, gravely, "I have but a confused remembrance
of your once having proposed something horrible to me.I would be free--I would have my person at my own disposal; but
I will never levy arms against my father, nor those it pleases him to
trust.""It was only for your Royal Highness's personal freedom that I was
presuming to speak," answered Ramorny."Were I in your Grace's place,
I would get me into that good boat which hovers on the Tay, and drop
quietly down to Fife, where you have many friends, and make free to take
possession of Falkland.It is a royal castle; and though the King has
bestowed it in gift on your uncle, yet surely, even if the grant were
not subject to challenge, your Grace might make free with the residence
of so near a relative.""He hath made free with mine," said the Duke, "as the stewartry of
Renfrew can tell.But stay, Ramorny--hold; did I not hear Errol say
that the Lady Marjory Douglas, whom they call Duchess of Rothsay, is
at Falkland?I would neither dwell with that lady nor insult her by
dislodging her.""The lady was there, my lord," replied Ramorny; "I have sure advice that
she is gone to meet her father."or perhaps to beg him to spare
me, providing I come on my knees to her bed, as pilgrims say the emirs
and amirals upon whom a Saracen soldan bestows a daughter in marriage
are bound to do?Ramorny, I will act by the Douglas's own saying, 'It
is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak.'I will keep both
foot and hand from fetters.""No place fitter than Falkland," replied Ramorny."I have enough of good
yeomen to keep the place; and should your Highness wish to leave it, a
brief ride reaches the sea in three directions."Neither mirth, music,
nor maidens--ha!""Pardon me, noble Duke; but, though the Lady Marjory Douglas be
departed, like an errant dame in romance, to implore succour of her
doughty sire, there is, I may say, a lovelier, I am sure a younger,
maiden, either presently at Falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither.Your Highness has not forgotten the Fair Maid of Perth?""Forget the prettiest wench in Scotland!No--any more than thou hast
forgotten the hand that thou hadst in the Curfew Street onslaught on St.Your Highness would say, the hand that I lost.As
certain as I shall never regain it, Catharine Glover is, or will soon
be, at Falkland.I will not flatter your Highness by saying she
expects to meet you; in truth, she proposes to place herself under the
protection of the Lady Marjory.""The little traitress," said the Prince--"she too to turn against me?"I trust your Grace will make her penance a gentle one," replied the
knight."Faith, I would have been her father confessor long ago, but I have ever
found her coy.""Opportunity was lacking, my lord," replied Ramorny; "and time presses
even now.""Nay, I am but too apt for a frolic; but my father--"

"He is personally safe," said Ramorny, "and as much at freedom as ever
he can be; while your Highness--"

"Must brook fetters, conjugal or literal--I know it.Yonder comes
Douglas, with his daughter in his hand, as haughty and as harsh featured
as himself, bating touches of age.""And at Falkland sits in solitude the fairest wench in Scotland," said
Ramorny."Here is penance and restraint, yonder is joy and freedom.""Thou hast prevailed, most sage counsellor," replied Rothsay; "but mark
you, it shall be the last of my frolics.""I trust so," replied Ramorny; "for, when at liberty, you may make a
good accommodation with your royal father.""I will write to him, Ramorny.No, I cannot
put my thoughts in words--do thou write.""Your Royal Highness forgets," said Ramorny, pointing to his mutilated
arm."So please your Highness," answered his counsellor, "if you would use
the hand of the mediciner, Dwining--he writes like a clerk.""Hath he a hint of the circumstances?"Fully," said Ramorny; and, stepping to the window, he called Dwining
from the boat.He entered the presence of the Prince of Scotland, creeping as if he
trode upon eggs, with downcast eyes, and a frame that seemed shrunk up
by a sense of awe produced by the occasion.I will make trial of you; thou
know'st the case--place my conduct to my father in a fair light."Dwining sat down, and in a few minutes wrote a letter, which he handed
to Sir John Ramorny."Why, the devil has aided thee, Dwining," said the knight.'Respected father and liege sovereign--Know that important
considerations induce me to take my departure from this your court,
purposing to make my abode at Falkland, both as the seat of my dearest
uncle Albany, with whom I know your Majesty would desire me to use all
familiarity, and as the residence of one from whom I have been too
long estranged, and with whom I haste to exchange vows of the closest
affection from henceforward.'"The Duke of Rothsay and Ramorny laughed aloud; and the physician,
who had listened to his own scroll as if it were a sentence of death,
encouraged by their applause, raised his eyes, uttered faintly his
chuckling note of "He!and was again grave and silent, as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds of reverent respect.The old man will apply
all this to the Duchess, as they call her, of Rothsay.Dwining, thou
shouldst be a secretis to his Holiness the Pope, who sometimes, it is
said, wants a scribe that can make one word record two meanings.I will
subscribe it, and have the praise of the device.""And now, my lord," said Ramorny, sealing the letter and leaving it
behind, "will you not to boat?""Not till my chamberlain attends with some clothes and necessaries, and
you may call my sewer also.""My lord," said Ramorny, "time presses, and preparation will but excite
suspicion.Your officers will follow with the mails tomorrow.For
tonight, I trust my poor service may suffice to wait on you at table and
chamber.""Nay, this time it is thou who forgets," said the Prince, touching the
wounded arm with his walking rod."Recollect, man, thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point--a goodly sewer or valet of the mouth!"Ramorny grinned with rage and pain; for his wound, though in a way of
healing, was still highly sensitive, and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble."Will your Highness now be pleased to take boat?""Not till I take leave of the Lord Constable.Rothsay must not slip
away, like a thief from a prison, from the house of Errol."My Lord Duke," said Ramorny, "it may be dangerous to our plan.""To the devil with danger, thy plan, and thyself!I must and will act to
Errol as becomes us both."The earl entered, agreeable to the Prince's summons."I gave you this trouble, my lord," said Rothsay, with the dignified
courtesy which he knew so well how to assume, "to thank you for your
hospitality and your good company.I can enjoy them no longer, as
pressing affairs call me to Falkland.""My lord," said the Lord High Constable, "I trust your Grace remembers
that you are--under ward."If I am a prisoner, speak plainly; if not, I will
take my freedom to depart.""I would, my lord, your Highness would request his Majesty's permission
for this journey."Mean you displeasure against yourself, my lord, or against me?""I have already said your Highness lies in ward here; but if you
determine to break it, I have no warrant--God forbid--to put force on
your inclinations.I can but entreat your Highness, for your own sake--"

"Of my own interest I am the best judge.The wilful Prince stepped into the boat with Dwining and Ramorny, and,
waiting for no other attendance, Eviot pushed off the vessel, which
descended the Tay rapidly by the assistance of sail and oar and of the
ebb tide.For some space the Duke of Rothsay appeared silent and moody, nor did
his companions interrupt his reflections.He raised his head at length
and said: "My father loves a jest, and when all is over he will take
this frolic at no more serious rate than it deserves--a fit of youth,
with which he will deal as he has with others.Yonder, my masters, shows
the old hold of Kinfauns, frowning above the Tay.Now, tell me, John
Ramorny, how thou hast dealt to get the Fair Maid of Perth out of the
hands of yonder bull headed provost; for Errol told me it was rumoured
that she was under his protection.""Truly she was, my lord, with the purpose of being transferred to the
patronage of the Duchess--I mean of the Lady Marjory of Douglas.Now,
this beetle headed provost, who is after all but a piece of blundering
valiancy, has, like most such, a retainer of some slyness and cunning,
whom he uses in all his dealings, and whose suggestions he generally
considers as his own ideas.Whenever I would possess myself of a
landward baron, I address myself to such a confidant, who, in the
present case, is called Kitt Henshaw, an old skipper upon the Tay,
and who, having in his time sailed as far as Campvere, holds with Sir
Patrick Charteris the respect due to one who has seen foreign countries.This his agent I have made my own, and by his means have insinuated
various apologies in order to postpone the departure of Catharine for
Falkland.""I know not if it is wise to tell your Highness, lest you should
disapprove of my views.I meant the officers of the Commission for
inquiry into heretical opinions should have found the Fair Maid at
Kinfauns, for our beauty is a peevish, self willed swerver from the
church; and certes, I designed that the knight should have come in
for his share of the fines and confiscations that were about to be
inflicted.The monks were eager enough to be at him, seeing he hath had
frequent disputes with them about the salmon tithe.""But wherefore wouldst thou have ruined the knight's fortunes, and
brought the beautiful young woman to the stake, perchance?"An old woman
might have been in some danger; and as for my Lord Provost, as they call
him, if they had clipped off some of his fat acres, it would have
been some atonement for the needless brave he put on me in St."Methinks, John, it was but a base revenge," said Rothsay.He that cannot right himself by the hand
must use his head.Well, that chance was over by the tender hearted
Douglas's declaring in favour of tender conscience; and then, my lord,
old Henshaw found no further objections to carrying the Fair Maid
of Perth to Falkland, not to share the dulness of the Lady Marjory's
society, as Sir Patrick Charteris and she herself doth opine, but to
keep your Highness from tiring when we return from hunting in the park."There was again a long pause, in which the Prince seemed to muse deeply."Ramorny, I have a scruple in this matter; but if I
name it to thee, the devil of sophistry, with which thou art possessed,
will argue it out of me, as it has done many others.This girl is the
most beautiful, one excepted, whom I ever saw or knew; and I like her
the more that she bears some features of--Elizabeth of Dunbar.But she,
I mean Catharine Glover, is contracted, and presently to be wedded, to
Henry the armourer, a craftsman unequalled for skill, and a man at arms
yet unmatched in the barrace.To follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong.""Your Highness will not expect me to be very solicitous of Henry Smith's
interest," said Ramorny, looking at his wounded arm.Andrew with his shored cross, this disaster of thine is too much
harped upon, John Ramorny!Others are content with putting a finger
into every man's pie, but thou must thrust in thy whole gory hand.It is
done, and cannot be undone; let it be forgotten.""Nay, my lord, you allude to it more frequently than I," answered the
knight--"in derision, it is true; while I--but I can be silent on the
subject if I cannot forget it.""Well, then, I tell thee that I have scruple about this intrigue.Dost
thou remember, when we went in a frolic to hear Father Clement preach,
or rather to see this fair heretic, that he spoke as touchingly as a
minstrel about the rich man taking away the poor man's only ewe lamb?""A great matter, indeed," answered Sir John, "that this churl's wife's
eldest son should be fathered by the Prince of Scotland!How many earls
would covet the like fate for their fair countesses?and how many that
have had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse for it?""And if I might presume to speak," said the mediciner, "the ancient
laws of Scotland assigned such a privilege to every feudal lord over his
female vassals, though lack of spirit and love of money hath made many
exchange it for gold.""I require no argument to urge me to be kind to a pretty woman; but this
Catharine has been ever cold to me," said the Prince."Nay, my lord," said Ramorny, "if, young, handsome, and a prince, you
know not how to make yourself acceptable to a fine woman, it is not for
me to say more.""And if it were not far too great audacity in me to speak again, I would
say," quoth the leech, "that all Perth knows that the Gow Chrom never
was the maiden's choice, but fairly forced upon her by her father.I
know for certain that she refused him repeatedly.""Nay, if thou canst assure us of that, the case is much altered," said
Rothsay."Vulcan was a smith as well as Harry Wynd; he would needs wed
Venus, and our chronicles tell us what came of it.""Then long may Lady Venus live and be worshipped," said Sir John
Ramorny, "and success to the gallant knight Mars who goes a-wooing to
her goddess-ship!"The discourse took a gay and idle turn for a few minutes; but the Duke
of Rothsay soon dropped it."I have left," he said, "yonder air of the
prison house behind me, and yet my spirits scarce revive.I feel that
drowsy, not unpleasing, yet melancholy mood that comes over us when
exhausted by exercise or satiated with pleasure.Some music now,
stealing on the ear, yet not loud enough to make us lift the eye, were a
treat for the gods.""Your Grace has but to speak your wishes, and the nymphs of the Tay are
as favourable as the fair ones upon the shore.said the Duke of Rothsay, listening; "it is, and rarely
touched.Steer towards the boat from
whence the music comes.""It is old Henshaw," said Ramorny, "working up the stream.The boatman answered the hail, and drew up alongside of the Prince's
barge.said the Prince, recognising the figure as well
as the appointments of the French glee woman, Louise."I think I owe
thee something for being the means of thy having a fright, at least,
upon St.Into this boat with thee, lute, puppy dog,
scrip and all; I will prefer thee to a lady's service who shall feed thy
very cur on capons and canary.""I trust your Highness will consider--" said Ramorny."I will consider nothing but my pleasure, John.Pray, do thou be so
complying as to consider it also.""Is it indeed to a lady's service you would promote me?""Oh, I have heard of that great lady!"said Louise; "and will you indeed
prefer me to your right royal consort's service?""I will, by my honour--whenever I receive her as such.Mark that
reservation, John," said he aside to Ramorny.The persons who were in the boat caught up the tidings, and, concluding
a reconciliation was about to take place betwixt the royal couple,
exhorted Louise to profit by her good fortune, and add herself to the
Duchess of Rothsay's train.Several offered her some acknowledgment for
the exercise of her talents.During this moment of delay, Ramorny whispered to Dwining: "Make in,
knave, with some objection.Rouse thy
wits, while I speak a word with Henshaw.""If I might presume to speak," said Dwining, "as one who have made
my studies both in Spain and Arabia, I would say, my lord, that the
sickness has appeared in Edinburgh, and that there may be risk in
admitting this young wanderer into your Highness's vicinity."and what is it to thee," said Rothsay, "whether I choose to be
poisoned by the pestilence or the 'pothecary?Must thou, too, needs
thwart my humour?"While the Prince thus silenced the remonstrances of Dwining, Sir John
Ramorny had snatched a moment to learn from Henshaw that the removal of
the Duchess of Rothsay from Falkland was still kept profoundly secret,
and that Catharine Glover would arrive there that evening or the
next morning, in expectation of being taken under the noble lady's
protection.The Duke of Rothsay, deeply plunged in thought, received this intimation
so coldly, that Ramorny took the liberty of remonstrating."This, my
lord," he said, "is playing the spoiled child of fortune.You wish for
liberty; it comes.You wish for beauty; it awaits you, with just so much
delay as to render the boon more precious.Even your slightest desires
seem a law to the Fates; for you desire music when it seems most
distant, and the lute and song are at your hand.These things, so sent,
should be enjoyed, else we are but like petted children, who break and
throw from them the toys they have wept themselves sick for.""To enjoy pleasure, Ramorny," said the Prince, "a man should have
suffered pain, as it requires fasting to gain a good appetite.We, who
can have all for a wish, little enjoy that all when we have possessed
it.Seest thou yonder thick cloud, which is about to burst to rain?It
seems to stifle me--the waters look dark and lurid--the shores have lost
their beautiful form--"

"My lord, forgive your servant," said Ramorny."You indulge a powerful
imagination, as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to rear
until he falls back on his master and crushes him.I pray you shake off
this lethargy.Shall the glee maiden make some music?""Let her; but it must be melancholy: all mirth would at this moment jar
on my ear."The maiden sung a melancholy dirge in Norman French; the words, of which
the following is an imitation, were united to a tune as doleful as they
are themselves:

     Yes, thou mayst sigh,
     And look once more at all around,
     At stream and bank, and sky and ground.Thy life its final course has found,
     And thou must die.Yes, lay thee down,
     And while thy struggling pulses flutter,
     Bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter,
     And the deep bell its death tone utter--
     Thy life is gone.'Tis but a pang, and then a thrill,
     A fever fit, and then a chill,
     And then an end of human ill,
     For thou art dead.The Prince made no observation on the music; and the maiden, at
Ramorny's beck, went on from time to time with her minstrel craft, until
the evening sunk down into rain, first soft and gentle, at length in
great quantities, and accompanied by a cold wind.There was neither
cloak nor covering for the Prince, and he sullenly rejected that which
Ramorny offered."It is not for Rothsay to wear your cast garments, Sir John; this melted
snow, which I feel pierce me to the very marrow, I am now encountering
by your fault.Why did you presume to put off the boat without my
servants and apparel?"Ramorny did not attempt an exculpation; for he knew the Prince was in
one of those humours, when to enlarge upon a grievance was more pleasing
to him than to have his mouth stopped by any reasonable apology.In
sullen silence, or amid unsuppressed chiding, the boat arrived at the
fishing village of Newburgh.The party landed, and found horses in
readiness, which, indeed, Ramorny had long since provided for the
occasion.Their quality underwent the Prince's bitter sarcasm, expressed
to Ramorny sometimes by direct words, oftener by bitter gibes.At length
they were mounted and rode on through the closing night and the falling
rain, the Prince leading the way with reckless haste.The glee maiden,
mounted by his express order, attended them and well for her that,
accustomed to severe weather, and exercise both on foot and horseback,
she supported as firmly as the men the fatigues of the nocturnal ride.Ramorny was compelled to keep at the Prince's rein, being under no small
anxiety lest, in his wayward fit, he might ride off from him entirely,
and, taking refuge in the house of some loyal baron, escape the snare
which was spread for him.He therefore suffered inexpressibly during the
ride, both in mind and in body.At length the forest of Falkland received them, and a glimpse of the
moon showed the dark and huge tower, an appendage of royalty itself,
though granted for a season to the Duke of Albany.On a signal given the
drawbridge fell.Torches glared in the courtyard, menials attended,
and the Prince, assisted from horseback, was ushered into an apartment,
where Ramorny waited on him, together with Dwining, and entreated him
to take the leech's advice.The Duke of Rothsay repulsed the proposal,
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared, and having stood for some time
shivering in his dank garments beside a large blazing fire, he retired
to his apartment without taking leave of anyone."You see the peevish humour of this childish boy, now," said Ramorny to
Dwining; "can you wonder that a servant who has done so much for him as
I have should be tired of such a master?""No, truly," said Dwining, "that and the promised earldom of Lindores
would shake any man's fidelity.But shall we commence with him this
evening?He has, if eye and cheek speak true, the foundation of a fever
within him, which will make our work easy while it will seem the effect
of nature.""It is an opportunity lost," said Ramorny; "but we must delay our blow
till he has seen this beauty, Catharine Glover.She may be hereafter a
witness that she saw him in good health, and master of his own motions,
a brief space before--you understand me?"Dwining nodded assent, and added:

"There is no time lost; for there is little difficulty in blighting a
flower exhausted from having been made to bloom too soon."in sooth he was a shameless wight,
     Sore given to revel and ungodly glee:
     Few earthly things found favour in his sight,
     Save concubines and carnal companie,
     And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.With the next morning the humour of the Duke of Rothsay was changed.He complained, indeed, of pain and fever, but they rather seemed to
stimulate than to overwhelm him.He was familiar with Ramorny, and
though he said nothing on the subject of the preceding night, it was
plain he remembered what he desired to obliterate from the memory of his
followers--the ill humour he had then displayed.He was civil to every
one, and jested with Ramorny on the subject of Catharine's arrival."How surprised will the pretty prude be at seeing herself in a family
of men, when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners
of Dame Marjory's waiting women!Thou hast not many of the tender sex in
thy household, I take it, Ramorny?""Faith, none except the minstrel wench, but a household drudge or two
whom we may not dispense with.By the way, she is anxiously inquiring
after the mistress your Highness promised to prefer her to.Shall I
dismiss her, to hunt for her new mistress at leisure?""By no means, she will serve to amuse Catharine.And, hark you, were it
not well to receive that coy jillet with something of a mumming?"We will not disappoint her, since she expects
to find the Duchess of Rothsay: I will be Duke and Duchess in my own
person.""No one so dull as a wit," said the Prince, "when he does not hit off
the scent at once.My Duchess, as they call her, has been in as great a
hurry to run away from Falkland as I to come hither.There is as much female trumpery in the wardrobe
adjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival.Look you,
I will play Dame Marjory, disposed on this day bed here with a mourning
veil and a wreath of willow, to show my forsaken plight; thou, John,
wilt look starch and stiff enough for her Galwegian maid of honour,
the Countess Hermigild; and Dwining shall present the old Hecate, her
nurse--only she hath more beard on her upper lip than Dwining on his
whole face, and skull to boot.He should have the commodity of a beard
to set her forth conformably.Get thy kitchen drudges, and what passable
pages thou hast with thee, to make my women of the bedroom.Ramorny hasted into the anteroom, and told Dwining the Prince's device."Do thou look to humour the fool," he said; "I care not how little I see
him, knowing what is to be done.""Trust all to me," said the physician, shrugging his shoulders."What
sort of a butcher is he that can cut the lamb's throat, yet is afraid to
hear it bleat?""Tush, fear not my constancy: I cannot forget that he would have cast
me into the cloister with as little regard as if he threw away the
truncheon of a broken lance.Begone--yet stay; ere you go to arrange
this silly pageant, something must be settled to impose on the thick
witted Charteris.He is like enough, should he be left in the belief
that the Duchess of Rothsay is still here, and Catharine Glover in
attendance on her, to come down with offers of service, and the like,
when, as I need scarce tell thee, his presence would be inconvenient.Indeed, this is the more likely, that some folks have given a warmer
name to the iron headed knight's great and tender patronage of this
damsel.""With that hint, let me alone to deal with him.I will send him such a
letter, that for this month he shall hold himself as ready for a journey
to hell as to Falkland.Can you tell me the name of the Duchess's
confessor?""Waltheof, a grey friar."In a few minutes, for he was a clerk of rare celerity, Dwining finished
a letter, which he placed in Ramorny's hand."This is admirable, and would have made thy fortune with Rothsay.I
think I should have been too jealous to trust thee in his household,
save that his day is closed.""Read it aloud," said Dwining, "that we may judge if it goes trippingly
off."And Ramorny read as follows: "By command of our high and mighty Princess
Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, and so forth, we Waltheof, unworthy brother
of the order of St.Francis, do thee, Sir Patrick Charteris, knight of
Kinfauns, to know, that her Highness marvels much at the temerity with
which you have sent to her presence a woman of whose fame she can judge
but lightly, seeing she hath made her abode, without any necessity,
for more than a week in thine own castle, without company of any other
female, saving menials; of which foul cohabitation the savour is gone
up through Fife, Angus, and Perthshire.Nevertheless, her Highness,
considering the ease as one of human frailty, hath not caused this
wanton one to be scourged with nettles, or otherwise to dree penance;
but, as two good brethren of the convent of Lindores, the Fathers
Thickskull and Dundermore, have been summoned up to the Highlands upon
an especial call, her Highness hath committed to their care this maiden
Catharine, with charge to convey her to her father, whom she states
to be residing beside Loch Tay, under whose protection she will find
a situation more fitting her qualities and habits than the Castle of
Falkland, while her Highness the Duchess of Rothsay abides there.She
hath charged the said reverend brothers so to deal with the young woman
as may give her a sense of the sin of incontinence, and she commendeth
thee to confession and penitence.--Signed, Waltheof, by command of an
high and mighty Princess"; and so forth.When he had finished, "Excellent--excellent!""This
unexpected rebuff will drive Charteris mad!He hath been long making
a sort of homage to this lady, and to find himself suspected of
incontinence, when he was expecting the full credit of a charitable
action, will altogether confound him; and, as thou say'st, it will be
long enough ere he come hither to look after the damsel or do honour
to the dame.But away to thy pageant, while I prepare that which shall
close the pageant for ever."It was an hour before noon, when Catharine, escorted by old Henshaw and
a groom of the Knight of Kinfauns, arrived before the lordly tower of
Falkland.The broad banner which was displayed from it bore the arms
of Rothsay, the servants who appeared wore the colours of the Prince's
household, all confirming the general belief that the Duchess still
resided there.Catharine's heart throbbed, for she had heard that
the Duchess had the pride as well as the high courage of the house
of Douglas, and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to
experience.On entering the castle, she observed that the train was
smaller than she had expected, but, as the Duchess lived in close
retirement, she was little surprised at this.In a species of anteroom
she was met by a little old woman, who seemed bent double with age, and
supported herself upon an ebony staff."Truly thou art welcome, fair daughter," said she, saluting Catharine,
"and, as I may say, to an afflicted house; and I trust (once more
saluting her) thou wilt be a consolation to my precious and right royal
daughter the Duchess.Sit thee down, my child, till I see whether my
lady be at leisure to receive thee.Ah, my child, thou art very lovely
indeed, if Our Lady hath given to thee a soul to match with so fair a
body."With that the counterfeit old woman crept into the next apartment,
where she found Rothsay in the masquerading habit he had prepared, and
Ramorny, who had evaded taking part in the pageant, in his ordinary
attire."Thou art a precious rascal, sir doctor," said the Prince; "by my
honour, I think thou couldst find in thy heart to play out the whole
play thyself, lover's part and all.""If it were to save your Highness trouble," said the leech, with his
usual subdued laugh."No--no," said Rothsay, "I never need thy help, man; and tell me now,
how look I, thus disposed on the couch--languishing and ladylike, ha?""Something too fine complexioned and soft featured for the Lady Marjory
of Douglas, if I may presume to say so," said the leech."Away, villain, and marshal in this fair frost piece--fear not she will
complain of my effeminacy; and thou, Ramorny, away also."As the knight left the apartment by one door, the fictitious old woman
ushered in Catharine Glover by another.The room had been carefully
darkened to twilight, so that Catharine saw the apparently female figure
stretched on the couch without the least suspicion.asked Rothsay, in a voice naturally sweet, and now
carefully modulated to a whispering tone."Let her approach, Griselda,
and kiss our hand."The supposed nurse led the trembling maiden forward to the side of the
couch, and signed to her to kneel.Catharine did so, and kissed with
much devotion and simplicity the gloved hand which the counterfeit
duchess extended to her."Be not afraid," said the same musical voice; "in me you only see a
melancholy example of the vanity of human greatness; happy those, my
child, whose rank places them beneath the storms of state."While he spoke, he put his arms around her neck and drew her towards
him, as if to salute her in token of welcome.But the kiss was bestowed
with an earnestness which so much overacted the part of the fair
patroness, that Catharine, concluding the Duchess had lost her senses,
screamed aloud.Catharine looked around her; the nurse was gone, and the Duke tearing
off his veil, she saw herself in the power of a daring young libertine.she said; "and Thou wilt, if I forsake
not myself."As this resolution darted through her mind, she repressed her
disposition to scream, and, as far as she might, strove to conceal her
fear."The jest hath been played," she said, with as much firmness as she
could assume; "may I entreat that your Highness will now unhand me?"for
he still kept hold of her arm."Nay, my pretty captive, struggle not--why should you fear?"As you are pleased to detain me, I will
not, by striving, provoke you to use me ill, and give pain to yourself,
when you have time to think.""Why, thou traitress, thou hast held me captive for months," said the
Prince, "and wilt thou not let me hold thee for a moment?""This were gallantry, my lord, were it in the streets of Perth, where I
might listen or escape as I listed; it is tyranny here.""And if I did let thee go, whither wouldst thou fly?""The bridges are up, the portcullis down, and the men who follow me are
strangely deaf to a peevish maiden's squalls.Be kind, therefore, and
you shall know what it is to oblige a prince.""Unloose me, then, my lord, and hear me appeal from thyself to thyself,
from Rothsay to the Prince of Scotland.I am the daughter of an humble
but honest citizen.I am, I may well nigh say, the spouse of a brave and
honest man.If I have given your Highness any encouragement for what you
have done, it has been unintentional.Thus forewarned, I entreat you to
forego your power over me, and suffer me to depart.Your Highness can
obtain nothing from me, save by means equally unworthy of knighthood or
manhood.""You are bold, Catharine," said the Prince, "but neither as a knight
nor a man can I avoid accepting a defiance.I must teach you the risk of
such challenges."While he spoke, he attempted to throw his arms again around her; but she
eluded his grasp, and proceeded in the same tone of firm decision."My strength, my lord, is as great to defend myself in an honourable
strife as yours can be to assail me with a most dishonourable purpose.Do not shame yourself and me by putting it to the combat.You may stun
me with blows, or you may call aid to overpower me; but otherwise you
will fail of your purpose.""The force I would
use is no more than excuses women in yielding to their own weakness.""Then keep it," said Catharine, "for those women who desire such an
excuse.My resistance is that of the most determined mind which love
of honour and fear of shame ever inspired.my lord, could you
succeed, you would but break every bond between me and life, between
yourself and honour.I have been trained fraudulently here, by what
decoys I know not; but were I to go dishonoured hence, it would be to
denounce the destroyer of my happiness to every quarter of Europe.I would take the palmer's staff in my hand, and wherever chivalry is
honoured, or the word Scotland has been heard, I would proclaim the heir
of a hundred kings, the son of the godly Robert Stuart, the heir of
the heroic Bruce, a truthless, faithless man, unworthy of the crown he
expects and of the spurs he wears.Every lady in wide Europe would hold
your name too foul for her lips; every worthy knight would hold you
a baffled, forsworn caitiff, false to the first vow of arms, the
protection of woman and the defence of the feeble."Rothsay resumed his seat, and looked at her with a countenance in which
resentment was mingled with admiration."You forget to whom you speak,
maiden.Know, the distinction I have offered you is one for which
hundreds whose trains you are born to bear would feel gratitude.""Once more, my lord," resumed Catharine, "keep these favours for those
by whom they are prized; or rather reserve your time and your health
for other and nobler pursuits--for the defence of your country and
the happiness of your subjects.Alas, my lord, how willingly would an
exulting people receive you for their chief!How gladly would they close
around you, did you show desire to head them against the oppression of
the mighty, the violence of the lawless, the seduction of the vicious,
and the tyranny of the hypocrite!"The Duke of Rothsay, whose virtuous feelings were as easily excited
as they were evanescent, was affected by the enthusiasm with which she
spoke."Forgive me if I have alarmed you, maiden," he said "thou art
too noble minded to be the toy of passing pleasure, for which my mistake
destined thee; and I, even were thy birth worthy of thy noble spirit and
transcendent beauty, have no heart to give thee; for by the homage of
the heart only should such as thou be wooed.But my hopes have been
blighted, Catharine: the only woman I ever loved has been torn from me
in the very wantonness of policy, and a wife imposed on me whom I must
ever detest, even had she the loveliness and softness which alone can
render a woman amiable in my eyes.My health is fading even in early
youth; and all that is left for me is to snatch such flowers as the
short passage from life to the grave will now present.Look at my hectic
cheek; feel, if you will, my intermitting pulse; and pity me and excuse
me if I, whose rights as a prince and as a man have been trampled upon
and usurped, feel occasional indifference towards the rights of others,
and indulge a selfish desire to gratify the wish of the passing moment."exclaimed Catharine, with the enthusiasm which belonged
to her character--"I will call you my dear lord, for dear must the heir
of Bruce be to every child of Scotland--let me not, I pray, hear you
speak thus!Your glorious ancestor endured exile, persecution, the night
of famine, and the day of unequal combat, to free his country; do you
practise the like self denial to free yourself.Tear yourself from those
who find their own way to greatness smoothed by feeding your follies.You know it not, I am sure--you could not
know; but the wretch who could urge the daughter to courses of shame by
threatening the life of the aged father is capable of all that is vile,
all that is treacherous!""He did indeed, my lord, and he dares not deny it.""It shall be looked to," answered the Duke of Rothsay."I have ceased
to love him; but he has suffered much for my sake, and I must see his
services honourably requited."Oh, my lord, if chronicles speak true, such services
brought Troy to ruins and gave the infidels possession of Spain.""Hush, maiden--speak within compass, I pray you," said the Prince,
rising up; "our conference ends here.""Yet one word, my Lord Duke of Rothsay," said Catharine, with animation,
while her beautiful countenance resembled that of an admonitory angel."I cannot tell what impels me to speak thus boldly; but the fire burns
within me, and will break out.Leave this castle without an hour's
delay; the air is unwholesome for you.Dismiss this Ramorny before the
day is ten minutes older; his company is most dangerous.""None in especial," answered Catharine, abashed at her own
eagerness--"none, perhaps, excepting my fears for your safety.""To vague fears the heir of Bruce must not listen.Ramorny entered, and bowed low to the Duke and to the maiden, whom,
perhaps, he considered as likely to be preferred to the post of
favourite sultana, and therefore entitled to a courteous obeisance."Ramorny," said the Prince, "is there in the household any female of
reputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till we can send her
where she may desire to go?""I fear," replied Ramorny, "if it displease not your Highness to hear
the truth, your household is indifferently provided in that way; and
that, to speak the very verity, the glee maiden is the most decorous
amongst us.""Let her wait upon this young person, then, since better may not be.And
take patience, maiden, for a few hours.""So, my lord, part you so soon from the Fair Maid of Perth?This is,
indeed, the very wantonness of victory.""There is neither victory nor defeat in the case," returned the Prince,
drily."The girl loves me not; nor do I love her well enough to torment
myself concerning her scruples.""The chaste Malcolm the Maiden revived in one of his descendants!""Favour me, sir, by a truce to your wit, or by choosing a different
subject for its career.It is noon, I believe, and you will oblige me by
commanding them to serve up dinner."Ramorny left the room; but Rothsay thought he discovered a smile upon
his countenance, and to be the subject of this man's satire gave him no
ordinary degree of pain.He summoned, however, the knight to his table,
and even admitted Dwining to the same honour.The conversation was of
a lively and dissolute cast, a tone encouraged by the Prince, as if
designing to counterbalance the gravity of his morals in the morning,
which Ramorny, who was read in old chronicles, had the boldness to liken
to the continence of Scipio.The banquet, nothwithstanding the Duke's indifferent health, was
protracted in idle wantonness far beyond the rules of temperance; and,
whether owing simply to the strength of the wine which he drank, or the
weakness of his constitution, or, as it is probable, because the last
wine which he quaffed had been adulterated by Dwining, it so happened
that the Prince, towards the end of the repast, fell into a lethargic
sleep, from which it seemed impossible to rouse him.Sir John Ramorny
and Dwining carried him to his chamber, accepting no other assistance
than that of another person, whom we will afterwards give name to.Next morning, it was announced that the Prince was taken ill of
an infectious disorder; and, to prevent its spreading through the
household, no one was admitted to wait on him save his late master of
horse, the physician Dwining, and the domestic already mentioned; one of
whom seemed always to remain in the apartment, while the others observed
a degree of precaution respecting their intercourse with the rest of the
family, so strict as to maintain the belief that he was dangerously ill
of an infectious disorder.In winter's tedious nights, sit by the fire,
     With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
     Of woeful ages, long ago betid:
     And, ere thou bid goodnight, to quit their grief,
     Tell thou the lamentable fall of me.King Richard II Act V. Scene I.


Far different had been the fate of the misguided heir of Scotland from
that which was publicly given out in the town of Falkland.His ambitious
uncle had determined on his death, as the means of removing the first
and most formidable barrier betwixt his own family and the throne.James, the younger son of the King, was a mere boy, who might at more
leisure be easily set aside.Ramorny's views of aggrandisement, and the
resentment which he had latterly entertained against his masters made
him a willing agent in young Rothsay's destruction.Dwining's love of
gold, and his native malignity of disposition, rendered him equally
forward.It had been resolved, with the most calculating cruelty,
that all means which might leave behind marks of violence were to be
carefully avoided, and the extinction of life suffered to take place
of itself by privation of every kind acting upon a frail and impaired
constitution.The Prince of Scotland was not to be murdered, as Ramorny
had expressed himself on another occasion, he was only to cease to
exist.Rothsay's bedchamber in the Tower of Falkland was well adapted
for the execution of such a horrible project.A small, narrow staircase,
scarce known to exist, opened from thence by a trapdoor to the
subterranean dungeons of the castle, through a passage by which
the feudal lord was wont to visit, in private and in disguise, the
inhabitants of those miserable regions.By this staircase the villains
conveyed the insensible Prince to the lowest dungeon of the castle,
so deep in the bowels of the earth, that no cries or groans, it was
supposed, could possibly be heard, while the strength of its door and
fastenings must for a long time have defied force, even if the entrance
could have been discovered.Bonthron, who had been saved from the
gallows for the purpose, was the willing agent of Ramorny's unparalleled
cruelty to his misled and betrayed patron.This wretch revisited the dungeon at the time when the Prince's lethargy
began to wear off, and when, awaking to sensation, he felt himself
deadly cold, unable to move, and oppressed with fetters, which scarce
permitted him to stir from the dank straw on which he was laid.His
first idea was that he was in a fearful dream, his next brought a
confused augury of the truth.He called, shouted, yelled at length in
frenzy but no assistance came, and he was only answered by the vaulted
roof of the dungeon.The agent of hell heard these agonizing screams,
and deliberately reckoned them against the taunts and reproaches with
which Rothsay had expressed his instinctive aversion to him.When,
exhausted and hopeless, the unhappy youth remained silent, the savage
resolved to present himself before the eyes of his prisoner.The locks
were drawn, the chain fell; the Prince raised himself as high as his
fetters permitted; a red glare, against which he was fain to shut his
eyes, streamed through the vault; and when he opened them again, it was
on the ghastly form of one whom he had reason to think dead."I am judged and condemned," he exclaimed, "and the most abhorred fiend
in the infernal regions is sent to torment me!""I live, my lord," said Bonthron; "and that you may live and enjoy life,
be pleased to sit up and eat your victuals.""Free me from these irons," said the Prince, "release me from this
dungeon, and, dog as thou art, thou shalt be the richest man in
Scotland.""If you would give me the weight of your shackles in gold," said
Bonthron, "I would rather see the iron on you than have the treasure
myself!But look up; you were wont to love delicate fare--behold how I
have catered for you."The wretch, with fiendish glee, unfolded a piece of rawhide covering the
bundle which he bore under' his arm, and, passing the light to and fro
before it, showed the unhappy Prince a bull's head recently hewn from
the trunk, and known in Scotland as the certain signal of death.He
placed it at the foot of the bed, or rather lair, on which the Prince
lay."Be moderate in your food," he said; "it is like to be long ere thou
getst another meal.""Tell me but one thing, wretch," said the Prince."Does Ramorny know of
this practice?""How else hadst thou been decoyed hither?Poor woodcock, thou art
snared!"With these words, the door shut, the bolts resounded, and the unhappy
Prince was left to darkness, solitude, and misery."Oh, my father!--my
prophetic father!The staff I leaned on has indeed proved a spear!"We will not dwell on the subsequent hours, nay, days, of bodily agony
and mental despair.But it was not the pleasure of Heaven that so great a crime should be
perpetrated with impunity.Catharine Glover and the glee woman, neglected by the other inmates,
who seemed to be engaged with the tidings of the Prince's illness, were,
however, refused permission to leave the castle until it should be seen
how this alarming disease was to terminate, and whether it was actually
an infectious sickness.Forced on each other's society, the two desolate
women became companions, if not friends; and the union drew somewhat
closer when Catharine discovered that this was the same female minstrel
on whose account Henry Wynd had fallen under her displeasure.She now
heard his complete vindication, and listened with ardour to the praises
which Louise heaped on her gallant protector.On the other hand, the
minstrel, who felt the superiority of Catharine's station and character,
willingly dwelt upon a theme which seemed to please her, and recorded
her gratitude to the stout smith in the little song of "Bold and True,"
which was long a favourite in Scotland.Oh, bold and true,
     In bonnet blue,
     That fear or falsehood never knew,
     Whose heart was loyal to his word,
     Whose hand was faithful to his sword--
     Seek Europe wide from sea to sea,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!I've seen Almain's proud champions prance,
     Have seen the gallant knights of France,
     Unrivall'd with the sword and lance,
     Have seen the sons of England true,
     Wield the brown bill and bend the yew.Search France the fair, and England free,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!In short, though Louise's disreputable occupation would have been in
other circumstances an objection to Catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company, yet, forced together as they now were, she found her a
humble and accommodating companion.They lived in this manner for four or five days, and, in order to avoid
as much as possible the gaze, and perhaps the incivility, of the menials
in the offices, they prepared their food in their own apartment.In the
absolutely necessary intercourse with domestics, Louise, more accustomed
to expedients, bolder by habit, and desirous to please Catharine,
willingly took on herself the trouble of getting from the pantler the
materials of their slender meal, and of arranging it with the dexterity
of her country.The glee woman had been abroad for this purpose upon the sixth day, a
little before noon; and the desire of fresh air, or the hope to find
some sallad or pot herbs, or at least an early flower or two, with which
to deck their board, had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle.She re-entered her apartment in the tower with a
countenance pale as ashes, and a frame which trembled like an aspen
leaf.Her terror instantly extended itself to Catharine, who could
hardly find words to ask what new misfortune had occurred.said Louise, speaking under her breath, and huddling
her words so thick upon each other that Catharine could hardly catch
the sense."I was seeking for flowers to dress your pottage, because
you said you loved them yesterday; my poor little dog, thrusting himself
into a thicket of yew and holly bushes that grow out of some old ruins
close to the castle wall, came back whining and howling.I crept forward
to see what might be the cause--and, oh!I heard a groaning as of one
in extreme pain, but so faint, that it seemed to arise out of the very
depth of the earth.At length, I found it proceeded from a small rent in
the wall, covered with ivy; and when I laid my ear close to the opening,
I could hear the Prince's voice distinctly say, 'It cannot now last
long'--and then it sunk away in something like a prayer.""I said, 'Is it you, my lord?'and the answer was, 'Who mocks me with
that title?'I asked him if I could help him, and he answered with a
voice I shall never forget, 'Food--food!So I came
hither to tell you.that were more likely to destroy than to aid," said Catharine."I know not yet," said Catharine, prompt and bold on occasions of
moment, though yielding to her companion in ingenuity of resource on
ordinary occasions: "I know not yet, but something we will do: the blood
of Bruce shall not die unaided."So saying, she seized the small cruise which contained their soup, and
the meat of which it was made, wrapped some thin cakes which she had
baked into the fold of her plaid, and, beckoning her companion to follow
with a vessel of milk, also part of their provisions, she hastened
towards the garden."So, our fair vestal is stirring abroad?"said the only man she met, who
was one of the menials; but Catharine passed on without notice or reply,
and gained the little garden without farther interruption.Louise indicated to her a heap of ruins, which, covered with underwood,
was close to the castle wall.It had probably been originally a
projection from the building; and the small fissure, which communicated
with the dungeon, contrived for air, had terminated within it.But the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay, and admitted a dim ray of
light to its recesses, although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torchlight aids."Here is dead silence," said Catharine, after she had listened
attentively for a moment."Heaven and earth, he is gone!""We must risk something," said her companion, and ran her fingers over
the strings of her guitar.A sigh was the only answer from the depth of the dungeon."I am here, my lord--I am here, with food and drink."The jest comes too late; I am dying," was the answer."His brain is turned, and no wonder," thought Catharine; "but whilst
there is life, there may be hope.""It is I, my lord, Catharine Glover.I have food, if I could pass it
safely to you."I thought the pain was over, but it glows
again within me at the name of food.""The food is here, but how--ah, how can I pass it to you?the chink
is so narrow, the wall is so thick!Yet there is a remedy--I have it.Quick, Louise; cut me a willow bough, the tallest you can find."The glee maiden obeyed, and, by means of a cleft in the top of the
wand, Catharine transmitted several morsels of the soft cakes, soaked in
broth, which served at once for food and for drink.The unfortunate young man ate little, and with difficulty, but prayed
for a thousand blessings on the head of his comforter."I had destined
thee to be the slave of my vices," he said, "and yet thou triest to
become the preserver of my life!"I will return with food as I shall see opportunity," said Catharine,
just as the glee maiden plucked her sleeve and desired her to be silent
and stand close.Both crouched among the ruins, and they heard the voices of Ramorny and
the mediciner in close conversation."He is stronger than I thought," said the former, in a low, croaking
tone."How long held out Dalwolsy, when the knight of Liddesdale
prisoned him in his castle of Hermitage?""For a fortnight," answered Dwining; "but he was a strong man, and had
some assistance by grain which fell from a granary above his prison
house.""Were it not better end the matter more speedily?He will demand to see the
Prince, and all must be over ere he comes."They passed on in their dark and fatal conversation."Now gain we the tower," said Catharine to her companion, when she saw
they had left the garden."I had a plan of escape for myself; I will
turn it into one of rescue for the Prince.The dey woman enters the
castle about vesper time, and usually leaves her cloak in the passage as
she goes into the pantlers' office with the milk.Take thou the cloak,
muffle thyself close, and pass the warder boldly; he is usually drunken
at that hour, and thou wilt go as the dey woman unchallenged through
gate and along bridge, if thou bear thyself with confidence.Then away
to meet the Black Douglas; he is our nearest and only aid.""But," said Louise, "is he not that terrible lord who threatened me with
shame and punishment?""Believe it," said Catharine, "such as thou or I never dwelt an hour in
the Douglas's memory, either for good or evil.Tell him that his son in
law, the Prince of Scotland dies--treacherously famished--in Falkland
Castle, and thou wilt merit not pardon only, but reward.""I care not for reward," said Louise; "the deed will reward itself.But
methinks to stay is more dangerous than to go.Let me stay, then, and
nourish the unhappy Prince, and do you depart to bring help.If they
kill me before you return, I leave you my poor lute, and pray you to be
kind to my poor Charlot.""No, Louise," replied Catharine, "you are a more privileged and
experienced wanderer than I--do you go; and if you find me dead on your
return, as may well chance, give my poor father this ring and a lock of
my hair, and say, Catharine died in endeavouring to save the blood of
Bruce.And give this other lock to Henry; say, Catharine thought of him
to the last, and that, if he has judged her too scrupulous touching the
blood of others, he will then know it was not because she valued her
own."They sobbed in each other's arms, and the intervening hours till evening
were spent in endeavouring to devise some better mode of supplying the
captive with nourishment, and in the construction of a tube, composed
of hollow reeds, slipping into each other, by which liquids might be
conveyed to him.The bell of the village church of Falkland tolled to
vespers.The dey, or farm woman, entered with her pitchers to deliver
the milk for the family, and to hear and tell the news stirring.She had
scarcely entered the kitchen when the female minstrel, again throwing
herself in Catharine's arms, and assuring her of her unalterable
fidelity, crept in silence downstairs, the little dog under her arm.A
moment after, she was seen by the breathless Catharine, wrapt in the dey
woman's cloak, and walking composedly across the drawbridge."So," said the warder, "you return early tonight, May Bridget?Small
mirth towards in the hall--ha, wench!"I have forgotten my tallies," said the ready witted French woman, "and
will return in the skimming of a bowie."She went onward, avoiding the village of Falkland, and took a footpath
which led through the park.Catharine breathed freely, and blessed God
when she saw her lost in the distance.It was another anxious hour
for Catharine which occurred before the escape of the fugitive was
discovered.This happened so soon as the dey girl, having taken an hour
to perform a task which ten minutes might have accomplished, was about
to return, and discovered that some one had taken away her grey frieze
cloak.A strict search was set on foot; at length the women of the
house remembered the glee maiden, and ventured to suggest her as one not
unlikely to exchange an old cloak for a new one.The warder, strictly
questioned, averred he saw the dey woman depart immediately after
vespers; and on this being contradicted by the party herself, he could
suggest, as the only alternative, that it must needs have been the
devil.John went back to the garden.As, however, the glee woman could not be found, the real circumstances
of the case were easily guessed at; and the steward went to inform Sir
John Ramorny and Dwining, who were now scarcely ever separate, of
the escape of one of their female captives.Everything awakens the
suspicions of the guilty.They looked on each other with faces of
dismay, and then went together to the humble apartment of Catharine,
that they might take her as much as possible by surprise while they
inquired into the facts attending Louise's disappearance.said Ramorny, in a tone of
austere gravity."I have no companion here," answered Catharine."Trifle not," replied the knight; "I mean the glee maiden, who lately
dwelt in this chamber with you.""She is gone, they tell me," said Catharine--"gone about an hour since.""How," answered Catharine, "should I know which way a professed wanderer
may choose to travel?She was tired no doubt of a solitary life, so
different from the scenes of feasting and dancing which her trade leads
her to frequent.She is gone, and the only wonder is that she should
have stayed so long.""This, then," said Ramorny, "is all you have to tell us?""All that I have to tell you, Sir John," answered Catharine, firmly;
"and if the Prince himself inquire, I can tell him no more.""There is little danger of his again doing you the honour to speak to
you in person," said Ramorny, "even if Scotland should escape being
rendered miserable by the sad event of his decease.""Is the Duke of Rothsay so very ill?""No help, save in Heaven," answered Ramorny, looking upward."Then may there yet be help there," said Catharine, "if human aid prove
unavailing!"said Ramorny, with the most determined gravity; while Dwining
adopted a face fit to echo the feeling, though it seemed to cost him
a painful struggle to suppress his sneering yet soft laugh of triumph,
which was peculiarly excited by anything having a religious tendency."And it is men--earthly men, and not incarnate devils, who thus appeal
to Heaven, while they are devouring by inches the life blood of their
hapless master!"muttered Catharine, as her two baffled inquisitors left
the apartment.But it will roll ere long, and
oh!may it be to preserve as well as to punish!"The hour of dinner alone afforded a space when, all in the castle being
occupied with that meal, Catharine thought she had the best opportunity
of venturing to the breach in the wall, with the least chance of being
observed.In waiting for the hour, she observed some stir in the castle,
which had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the Duke
of Rothsay.The portcullis was lowered and raised, and the creaking of
the machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse, as men at arms
went out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam.She
observed, too, that such domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms.All this made her heart throb high, for it augured the
approach of rescue; and besides, the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever.At length the hour of noon arrived; she had taken care
to provide, under pretence of her own wishes, which the pantler seemed
disposed to indulge, such articles of food as could be the most easily
conveyed to the unhappy captive.She whispered to intimate her presence;
there was no answer; she spoke louder, still there was silence."He sleeps," she muttered these words half aloud, and with a shuddering
which was succeeded by a start and a scream, when a voice replied behind
her:

"Yes, he sleeps; but it is for ever."Sir John Ramorny stood behind her in complete armour,
but the visor of his helmet was up, and displayed a countenance more
resembling one about to die than to fight.He spoke with a grave tone,
something between that of a calm observer of an interesting event and of
one who is an agent and partaker in it."Catharine," he said, "all is true which I tell you.You
have done your best for him; you can do no more.""I will not--I cannot believe it," said Catharine."Heaven be merciful
to me!it would make one doubt of Providence, to think so great a crime
has been accomplished.""Doubt not of Providence, Catharine, though it has suffered the
profligate to fall by his own devices.Follow me; I have that to say
which concerns you.I say follow (for she hesitated), unless you prefer
being left to the mercies of the brute Bonthron and the mediciner
Henbane Dwining.""I will follow you," said Catharine."You cannot do more to me than you
are permitted."He led the way into the tower, and mounted staircase after staircase and
ladder after ladder."I will follow no farther," she said.If to my death, I can die here.""Only to the battlements of the castle, fool," said Ramorny, throwing
wide a barred door which opened upon the vaulted roof of the castle,
where men were bending mangonels, as they called them (military engines,
that is, for throwing arrows or stones), getting ready crossbows, and
piling stones together.But the defenders did not exceed twenty in
number, and Catharine thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them."Catharine," said Ramorny, "I must not quit this station, which is
necessary for my defence; but I can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere.""Say on," answered Catharine, "I am prepared to hear you.""You have thrust yourself, Catharine, into a bloody secret.Have you the
firmness to keep it?""I do not understand you, Sir John," answered the maiden.I have slain--murdered, if you will--my late master, the Duke
of Rothsay.The spark of life which your kindness would have fed
was easily smothered.You are
faint--bear up--you have more to hear.You know the crime, but you know
not the provocation.this gauntlet is empty; I lost my right hand
in his cause, and when I was no longer fit to serve him, I was cast off
like a worn out hound, my loss ridiculed, and a cloister recommended,
instead of the halls and palaces in which I had my natural sphere!Think
on this--pity and assist me.""In what manner can you require my assistance?"said the trembling
maiden; "I can neither repair your loss nor cancel your crime.""Thou canst be silent, Catharine, on what thou hast seen and heard in
yonder thicket.It is but a brief oblivion I ask of you, whose word
will, I know, be listened to, whether you say such things were or were
not.That of your mountebank companion, the foreigner, none will hold
to be of a pin point's value.If you grant me this, I will take your
promise for my security, and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it.If you will not promise silence, I defend this castle till
every one perishes, and I fling you headlong from these battlements.Ay, look at them--it is not a leap to be rashly braved.Seven courses of
stairs brought you up hither with fatigue and shortened breath; but you
shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer time than you can breathe
a sigh!Speak the word, fair maid; for you speak to one unwilling to
harm you, but determined in his purpose."Catharine stood terrified, and without power of answering a man who
seemed so desperate; but she was saved the necessity of reply by the
approach of Dwining.He spoke with the same humble conges which at all
times distinguished his manner, and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer, which gave that manner the lie."I do you wrong, noble sir, to intrude on your valiancie when engaged
with a fair damsel.But I come to ask a trifling question."said Ramorny; "ill news are sport to thee even when
they affect thyself, so that they concern others also.""Hem!--he, he!--I only desired to know if your knighthood proposed the
chivalrous task of defending the castle with your single hand--I crave
pardon, I meant your single arm?The question is worth asking, for I
am good for little to aid the defence, unless you could prevail on the
besiegers to take physic--he, he, he!--and Bonthron is as drunk as ale
and strong waters can make him; and you, he, and I make up the whole
garrison who are disposed for resistance.""Never saw men who showed less stomach to the work," answered
Dwining--"never.Eviot and his companion Buncle now approached, with sullen resolution
in their faces, like men who had made their minds up to resist that
authority which they had so long obeyed.said Ramorny, stepping forward to meet them.Why have you left the barbican, Eviot?And you other fellow,
did I not charge you to look to the mangonels?""We have something to tell you, Sir John Ramorny," answered Eviot."We
will not fight in this quarrel.""How--my own squires control me?""We were your squires and pages, my lord, while you were master of the
Duke of Rothsay's household.It is bruited about the Duke no longer
lives; we desire to know the truth.""What traitor dares spread such falsehoods?""All who have gone out to skirt the forest, my lord, and I myself among
others, bring back the same news.The minstrel woman who left the castle
yesterday has spread the report everywhere that the Duke of Rothsay
is murdered, or at death's door.The Douglas comes on us with a strong
force--"

"And you, cowards, take advantage of an idle report to forsake your
master?""My lord," said Eviot, "let Buncle and myself see the Duke of Rothsay,
and receive his personal orders for defence of this castle, and if we do
not fight to the death in that quarrel, I will consent to be hanged on
its highest turret.But if he be gone by natural disease, we will yield
up the castle to the Earl of Douglas, who is, they say, the King's
lieutenant.Or if--which Heaven forefend!--the noble Prince has had
foul play, we will not involve ourselves in the guilt of using arms in
defence of the murderers, be they who they will.""Eviot," said Ramorny, raising his mutilated arm, "had not that glove
been empty, thou hadst not lived to utter two words of this insolence.""It is as it is," answered Evict, "and we do but our duty.I have
followed you long, my lord, but here I draw bridle.""Farewell, then, and a curse light on all of you!""Our valiancie is about to run away," said the mediciner, who had crept
close to Catharine's side before she was aware."Catharine, thou art a
superstitious fool, like most women; nevertheless thou hast some mind,
and I speak to thee as one of more understanding than the buffaloes
which are herding about us.These haughty barons who overstride the
world, what are they in the day of adversity?Let
their sledge hammer hands or their column resembling legs have injury,
and bah!Heart and courage is nothing to
them, lith and limb everything: give them animal strength, what are they
better than furious bulls; take that away, and your hero of chivalry
lies grovelling like the brute when he is hamstrung.Not so the sage;
while a grain of sense remains in a crushed or mutilated frame, his mind
shall be strong as ever.Catharine, this morning I was practising your
death; but methinks I now rejoice that you may survive to tell how the
poor mediciner, the pill gilder, the mortar pounder, the poison vender,
met his fate, in company with the gallant Knight of Ramorny, Baron in
possession and Earl of Lindores in expectation--God save his lordship!""Old man," said Catharine, "if thou be indeed so near the day of thy
deserved doom, other thoughts were far wholesomer than the vainglorious
ravings of a vain philosophy.Ask to see a holy man--"

"Yes," said Dwining, scornfully, "refer myself to a greasy monk, who
does not--he!he!--understand the barbarous Latin he repeats by
rote.Such would be a fitting counsellor to one who has studied both
in Spain and Arabia!No, Catharine, I will choose a confessor that is
pleasant to look upon, and you shall be honoured with the office.Now,
look yonder at his valiancie, his eyebrow drops with moisture, his lip
trembles with agony; for his valiancie--he!he!--is pleading for his
life with his late domestics, and has not eloquence enough to persuade
them to let him slip.See how the fibres of his face work as he implores
the ungrateful brutes, whom he has heaped with obligations, to permit
him to get such a start for his life as the hare has from the greyhounds
when men course her fairly.Look also at the sullen, downcast, dogged
faces with which, fluctuating between fear and shame, the domestic
traitors deny their lord this poor chance for his life.These things
thought themselves the superior of a man like me!and you, foolish
wench, think so meanly of your Deity as to suppose wretches like them
are the work of Omnipotence!"said Catharine, warmly; "the God I worship
created these men with the attributes to know and adore Him, to guard
and defend their fellow creatures, to practise holiness and virtue.Their own vices, and the temptations of the Evil One, have made them
such as they now are.Oh, take the lesson home to thine own heart of
adamant!Heaven made thee wiser than thy fellows, gave thee eyes to look
into the secrets of nature, a sagacious heart, and a skilful hand; but
thy pride has poisoned all these fair gifts, and made an ungodly atheist
of one who might have been a Christian sage!""Atheist, say'st thou?""Perhaps I have doubts on that
matter--but they will be soon solved.Yonder comes one who will send
me, as he has done thousands, to the place where all mysteries shall be
cleared."Catharine followed the mediciner's eye up one of the forest glades, and
beheld it occupied by a body of horsemen advancing at full gallop.In
the midst was a pennon displayed, which, though its bearings were not
visible to Catharine, was, by a murmur around, acknowledged as that of
the Black Douglas.They halted within arrow shot of the castle, and a
herald with two trumpets advanced up to the main portal, where, after a
loud flourish, he demanded admittance for the high and dreaded Archibald
Earl of Douglas, Lord Lieutenant of the King, and acting for the time
with the plenary authority of his Majesty; commanding, at the same time,
that the inmates of the castle should lay down their arms, all under
penalty of high treason.said Eviot to Ramorny, who stood sullen and undecided."Will
you give orders to render the castle, or must I?"interrupted the knight, "to the last I will command you.Open the gates, drop the bridge, and render the castle to the Douglas.""Now, that's what may be called a gallant exertion of free will," said
Dwining."Just as if the pieces of brass that were screaming a minute
since should pretend to call those notes their own which are breathed
through them by a frowsy trumpeter."said Catharine, "either be silent or turn thy thoughts
to the eternity on the brink of which thou art standing.""Thou canst not, wench,
help hearing what I say to thee, and thou wilt tell it again, for thy
sex cannot help that either.Perth and all Scotland shall know what a
man they have lost in Henbane Dwining!"The clash of armour now announced that the newcomers had dismounted and
entered the castle, and were in the act of disarming the small garrison.Earl Douglas himself appeared on the battlements, with a few of his
followers, and signed to them to take Ramorny and Dwining into custody.Others dragged from some nook the stupefied Bonthron."It was to these three that the custody of the Prince was solely
committed daring his alleged illness?"said the Douglas, prosecuting an
inquiry which he had commenced in the hall of the castle."No other saw him, my lord," said Eviot, "though I offered my services.""Conduct us to the Duke's apartment, and bring the prisoners with
us.Also should there be a female in the castle, if she hath not been
murdered or spirited away--the companion of the glee maiden who brought
the first alarm.""She is here, my lord," said Eviot, bringing Catharine forward.Her beauty and her agitation made some impression even upon the
impassible Earl."Fear nothing, maiden," he said; "thou hast deserved both praise and
reward.Tell to me, as thou wouldst confess to Heaven, the things thou
hast witnessed in this castle."Few words served Catharine to unfold the dreadful story."It agrees," said the Douglas, "with the tale of the glee maiden, from
point to point.They passed to the room which the unhappy Duke of Rothsay had been
supposed to inhabit; but the key was not to be found, and the Earl could
only obtain entrance by forcing the door.On entering, the wasted and
squalid remains of the unhappy Prince were discovered, flung on the bed
as if in haste.The intention of the murderers had apparently been to
arrange the dead body so as to resemble a timely parted corpse, but they
had been disconcerted by the alarm occasioned by the escape of Louise.Douglas looked on the body of the misguided youth, whose wild passions
and caprices had brought him to this fatal and premature catastrophe."I had wrongs to be redressed," he said; "but to see such a sight as
this banishes all remembrance of injury!"It should have been arranged," said Dwining, "more to your
omnipotence's pleasure; but you came suddenly on us, and hasty masters
make slovenly service."Douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner said, so closely did he
examine the wan and wasted features, and stiffened limbs, of the dead
body before him.Catharine, overcome by sickness and fainting, at length
obtained permission to retire from the dreadful scene, and, through
confusion of every description, found her way to her former apartment,
where she was locked in the arms of Louise, who had returned in the
interval.The dying hand of the Prince
was found to be clenched upon a lock of hair, resembling, in colour and
texture, the coal black bristles of Bonthron.Thus, though famine had
begun the work, it would seem that Rothsay's death had been finally
accomplished by violence.The private stair to the dungeon, the keys of
which were found at the subaltern assassin's belt, the situation of the
vault, its communication with the external air by the fissure in the
walls, and the wretched lair of straw, with the fetters which remained
there, fully confirmed the story of Catharine and of the glee woman."We will not hesitate an instant," said the Douglas to his near kinsman,
the Lord Balveny, as soon as they returned from the dungeon."But, my lord, some trial may be fitting," answered Balveny."I have taken them red hand; my
authority will stretch to instant execution.Yet stay--have we not some
Jedwood men in our troop?""Plenty of Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Ainslies, and so forth," said
Balveny."Call me an inquest of these together; they are all good men and true,
saving a little shifting for their living.Do you see to the execution
of these felons, while I hold a court in the great hall, and we'll try
whether the jury or the provost marshal do their work first; we will
have Jedwood justice--hang in haste and try at leisure.""Yet stay, my lord," said Ramorny, "you may rue your haste--will you
grant me a word out of earshot?"said Douglas; "speak out what thou hast to say before
all that are here present.""Know all; then," said Ramorny, aloud, "that this noble Earl had letters
from the Duke of Albany and myself, sent him by the hand of yon cowardly
deserter, Buncle--let him deny it if he dare--counselling the removal
of the Duke for a space from court, and his seclusion in this Castle of
Falkland.""But not a word," replied Douglas, sternly smiling, "of his being flung
into a dungeon--famished--strangled.Away with the wretches, Balveny,
they pollute God's air too long!"The prisoners were dragged off to the battlements.But while the means
of execution were in the act of being prepared, the apothecary expressed
so ardent a desire to see Catharine once more, and, as he said, for
the good of his soul, that the maiden, in hopes his obduracy might have
undergone some change even at the last hour, consented again to go
to the battlements, and face a scene which her heart recoiled from.A single glance showed her Bonthron, sunk in total and drunken
insensibility; Ramorny, stripped of his armour, endeavouring in vain to
conceal fear, while he spoke with a priest, whose good offices he had
solicited; and Dwining, the same humble, obsequious looking, crouching
individual she had always known him.He held in his hand a little silver
pen, with which he had been writing on a scrap of parchment."Catharine," he said--"he, he, he!--I wish to speak to thee on the
nature of my religious faith.""If such be thy intention, why lose time with me?"The good father," said Dwining, "is--he, he!--already a worshipper of
the deity whom I have served.I therefore prefer to give the altar of
mine idol a new worshipper in thee, Catharine.This scrap of parchment
will tell thee how to make your way into my chapel, where I have
worshipped so often in safety.I leave the images which it contains to
thee as a legacy, simply because I hate and contemn thee something less
than any of the absurd wretches whom I have hitherto been obliged to
call fellow creatures.And now away--or remain and see if the end of the
quacksalver belies his life.""Nay," said the mediciner, "I have but a single word to say, and yonder
nobleman's valiancie may hear it if he will."Lord Balveny approached, with some curiosity; for the undaunted
resolution of a man who never wielded sword or bore armour and was in
person a poor dwindled dwarf, had to him an air of something resembling
sorcery.""You see this trifling implement," said the criminal, showing the
silver pen."By means of this I can escape the power even of the Black
Douglas.""Give him no ink nor paper," said Balveny, hastily, "he will draw a
spell.""Not so, please your wisdom and valiancie--he, he, he!"said Dwining
with his usual chuckle, as he unscrewed the top of the pen, within which
was a piece of sponge or some such substance, no bigger than a pea."Now, mark this--" said the prisoner, and drew it between his lips.He lay a dead corpse before them, the
contemptuous sneer still on his countenance.Catharine shrieked and fled, seeking, by a hasty descent, an escape from
a sight so appalling.Lord Balveny was for a moment stupified, and then
exclaimed, "This may be glamour!hang him over the battlements, quick
or dead.If his foul spirit hath only withdrawn for a space, it shall
return to a body with a dislocated neck."Ramorny and Bonthron were then ordered for
execution.The last was hanged before he seemed quite to comprehend what
was designed to be done with him.Ramorny, pale as death, yet with
the same spirit of pride which had occasioned his ruin, pleaded his
knighthood, and demanded the privilege of dying by decapitation by the
sword, and not by the noose."The Douglas never alters his doom," said Balveny."But thou shalt have
all thy rights.The menial whom he called appeared at his summons."What shakest thou for, fellow?"said Balveny; "here, strike me this
man's gilt spurs from his heels with thy cleaver.And now, John Ramorny,
thou art no longer a knight, but a knave.To the halter with him,
provost marshal!hang him betwixt his companions, and higher than them
if it may be."In a quarter of an hour afterwards, Balveny descended to tell the
Douglas that the criminals were executed."Then there is no further use in the trial," said the Earl."How say
you, good men of inquest, were these men guilty of high treason--ay or
no?""Guilty," exclaimed the obsequious inquest, with edifying unanimity, "we
need no farther evidence.""Sound trumpets, and to horse then, with our own train only; and let
each man keep silence on what has chanced here, until the proceedings
shall be laid before the King, which cannot conveniently be till the
battle of Palm Sunday shall be fought and ended.Select our attendants,
and tell each man who either goes with us or remains behind that he who
prates dies."In a few minutes the Douglas was on horseback, with the followers
selected to attend his person.Expresses were sent to his daughter, the
widowed Duchess of Rothsay, directing her to take her course to Perth,
by the shores of Lochleven, without approaching Falkland, and committing
to her charge Catharine Glover and the glee woman, as persons whose
safety he tendered.As they rode through the forest, they looked back, and beheld the three
bodies hanging, like specks darkening the walls of the old castle."The hand is punished," said Douglas, "but who shall arraign the head by
whose direction the act was done?""I do, kinsman; and were I to listen to the dictates of my heart, I
would charge him with the deed, which I am certain he has authorised.But there is no proof of it beyond strong suspicion, and Albany has
attached to himself the numerous friends of the house of Stuart, to
whom, indeed, the imbecility of the King and the ill regulated habits
of Rothsay left no other choice of a leader.Were I, therefore, to break
the bond which I have so lately formed with Albany, the consequence
must be civil war, an event ruinous to poor Scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity of the Percy, backed by the treachery
of March.No, Balveny, the punishment of Albany must rest with Heaven,
which, in its own good time, will execute judgment on him and on his
house."The hour is nigh: now hearts beat high;
     Each sword is sharpen'd well;
     And who dares die, who stoops to fly,
     Tomorrow's light shall tell.We are now to recall to our reader's recollection, that Simon Glover and
his fair daughter had been hurried from their residence without having
time to announce to Henry Smith either their departure or the alarming
cause of it.When, therefore, the lover appeared in Curfew Street, on
the morning of their flight, instead of the hearty welcome of the honest
burgher, and the April reception, half joy half censure, which he had
been promised on the part of his lovely daughter, he received only the
astounding intelligence, that her father and she had set off early, on
the summons of a stranger, who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation.To this, Dorothy, whose talents for forestalling evil, and
communicating her views of it, are known to the reader, chose to add,
that she had no doubt her master and young mistress were bound for the
Highlands, to avoid a visit which had been made since their departure by
two or three apparitors, who, in the name of a Commission appointed by
the King, had searched the house, put seals upon such places as were
supposed to contain papers, and left citations for father and daughter
to appear before the Court of Commission, on a day certain, under pain
of outlawry.All these alarming particulars Dorothy took care to state
in the gloomiest colours, and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was, that her master had charged her to tell him to
reside quietly at Perth, and that he should soon hear news of them.This
checked the smith's first resolve, which was to follow them instantly to
the Highlands, and partake the fate which they might encounter.But when he recollected his repeated feuds with divers of the Clan
Quhele, and particularly his personal quarrel with Conachar, who was now
raised to be a high chief, he could not but think, on reflection, that
his intrusion on their place of retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy there than be of any service
to them.He was well acquainted with Simon's habitual intimacy with
the chief of the Clan Quhele, and justly augured that the glover would
obtain protection, which his own arrival might be likely to disturb,
while his personal prowess could little avail him in a quarrel with
a whole tribe of vindictive mountaineers.At the same time his heart
throbbed with indignation, when he thought of Catharine being within the
absolute power of young Conachar, whose rivalry he could not doubt, and
who had now so many means of urging his suit.What if the young chief
should make the safety of the father depend on the favour of the
daughter?He distrusted not Catharine's affections, but then her mode
of thinking was so disinterested, and her attachment to her father so
tender, that, if the love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security, or perhaps his life, it was matter of deep and awful doubt
whether it might not be found light in the balance.Tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell, he resolved nevertheless to
remain at home, stifle his anxiety as he might, and await the promised
intelligence from the old man.It came, but it did not relieve his
concern.Sir Patrick Charteris had not forgotten his promise to communicate to
the smith the plans of the fugitives.But, amid the bustle occasioned by
the movement of troops, he could not himself convey the intelligence.He therefore entrusted to his agent, Kitt Henshaw, the task of making it
known.But this worthy person, as the reader knows, was in the interest
of Ramorny, whose business it was to conceal from every one, but
especially from a lover so active and daring as Henry, the real place of
Catharine's residence.Henshaw therefore announced to the anxious smith
that his friend the glover was secure in the Highlands; and though he
affected to be more reserved on the subject of Catharine, he said little
to contradict the belief that she as well as Simon shared the protection
of the Clan Quhele.But he reiterated, in the name of Sir Patrick,
assurances that father and daughter were both well, and that Henry would
best consult his own interest and their safety by remaining quiet and
waiting the course of events.With an agonized heart, therefore, Henry Gow determined to remain quiet
till he had more certain intelligence, and employed himself in finishing
a shirt of mail, which he intended should be the best tempered and the
most finely polished that his skilful hands had ever executed.This
exercise of his craft pleased him better than any other occupation which
he could have adopted, and served as an apology for secluding himself
in his workshop, and shunning society, where the idle reports which were
daily circulated served only to perplex and disturb him.He resolved to
trust in the warm regard of Simon, the faith of his daughter, and the
friendship of the provost, who, having so highly commended his valour
in the combat with Bonthron, would never, he thought, desert him at this
extremity of his fortunes.Time, however, passed on day by day; and
it was not till Palm Sunday was near approaching, that Sir Patrick
Charteris, having entered the city to make some arrangements for the
ensuing combat, bethought himself of making a visit to the Smith of the
Wynd.He entered his workshop with an air of sympathy unusual to him, and
which made Henry instantly augur that he brought bad news.The smith
caught the alarm, and the uplifted hammer was arrested in its descent
upon the heated iron, while the agitated arm that wielded it, strong
before as that of a giant, became so powerless, that it was with
difficulty Henry was able to place the weapon on the ground, instead of
dropping it from his hand."My poor Henry," said Sir Patrick, "I bring you but cold news; they are
uncertain, however, and, if true, they are such as a brave man like you
should not take too deeply to heart.""In God's name, my lord," said Henry, "I trust you bring no evil news of
Simon Glover or his daughter?""Touching themselves," said Sir Patrick, "no: they are safe and well.But as to thee, Henry, my tidings are more cold.Kitt Henshaw has, I
think, apprised thee that I had endeavoured to provide Catharine Glover
with a safe protection in the house of an honourable lady, the Duchess
of Rothsay.But she hath declined the charge, and Catharine hath been
sent to her father in the Highlands.Thou
mayest have heard that Gilchrist MacIan is dead, and that his son
Eachin, who was known in Perth as the apprentice of old Simon, by the
name of Conachar, is now the chief of Clan Quhele; and I heard from one
of my domestics that there is a strong rumour among the MacIans that the
young chief seeks the hand of Catharine in marriage.My domestic learned
this--as a secret, however--while in the Breadalbane country, on some
arrangements touching the ensuing combat.The thing is uncertain but,
Henry, it wears a face of likelihood.""Did your lordship's servant see Simon Glover and his daughter?"said
Henry, struggling for breath, and coughing, to conceal from the provost
the excess of his agitation."He did not," said Sir Patrick; "the Highlanders seemed jealous, and
refused to permit him to speak to the old man, and he feared to alarm
them by asking to see Catharine.Besides, he talks no Gaelic, nor had
his informer much English, so there may be some mistake in the matter.Nevertheless, there is such a report, and I thought it best to tell it
you.But you may be well assured that the wedding cannot go on till the
affair of Palm Sunday be over; and I advise you to take no step till we
learn the circumstances of the matter, for certainty is most desirable,
even when it is painful.Go you to the council house," he added, after a
pause, "to speak about the preparations for the lists in the North Inch?"Well, Smith, I judge by your brief answer that you are discomposed with
this matter; but, after all, women are weathercocks, that is the truth
on't.Solomon and others have proved it before you."And so Sir Patrick Charteris retired, fully convinced he had discharged
the office of a comforter in the most satisfactory manner.With very different impressions did the unfortunate lover regard the
tidings and listen to the consoling commentary."The provost," he said bitterly to himself, "is an excellent man; marry,
he holds his knighthood so high, that, if he speaks nonsense, a poor man
must hold it sense, as he must praise dead ale if it be handed to him
in his lordship's silver flagon.How would all this sound in another
situation?Suppose I were rolling down the steep descent of the
Corrichie Dhu, and before I came to the edge of the rock, comes my Lord
Provost, and cries: 'Henry, there is a deep precipice, and I grieve to
say you are in the fair way of rolling over it.But be not downcast,
for Heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop your progress.However, I
thought it would be comfort to you to know the worst, which you will
be presently aware of.I do not know how many hundred feet deep the
precipice descends, but you may form a judgment when you are at the
bottom, for certainty is certainty.when come you to take
a game at bowls?'And this gossip is to serve instead of any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck!When I think of this, I could go
mad, seize my hammer, and break and destroy all around me.But I will
be calm; and if this Highland kite, who calls himself a falcon, should
stoop at my turtle dove, he shall know whether a burgess of Perth can
draw a bow or not."It was now the Thursday before the fated Palm Sunday, and the champions
on either side were expected to arrive the next day, that they might
have the interval of Saturday to rest, refresh themselves, and prepare
for the combat.Two or three of each of the contending parties were
detached to receive directions about the encampment of their little
band, and such other instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering of the field.Henry was not, therefore, surprised at seeing a
tall and powerful Highlander peering anxiously about the wynd in which
he lived, in the manner in which the natives of a wild country examine
the curiosities of one that is more civilized.The smith's heart rose
against the man on account of his country, to which our Perth burgher
bore a natural prejudice, and more especially as he observed the
individual wear the plaid peculiar to the Clan Quhele.The sprig of oak
leaves, worked in silk, intimated also that the individual was one
of those personal guards of young Eachin, upon whose exertions in the
future battle so much reliance was placed by those of their clan.Having observed so much, Henry withdrew into his smithy, for the sight
of the man raised his passion; and, knowing that the Highlander came
plighted to a solemn combat, and could not be the subject of any
inferior quarrel, he was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him.In a few minutes, however, the door of the smithy flew open,
and flattering in his tartans, which greatly magnified his actual size,
the Gael entered with the haughty step of a man conscious of a personal
dignity superior to anything which he is likely to meet with.He stood
looking around him, and seemed to expect to be received with courtesy
and regarded with wonder.But Henry had no sort of inclination to
indulge his vanity and kept hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware of his visitor's presence.(the bandy legged smith), said the Highlander."Those that wish to be crook backed call me so," answered Henry."No offence meant," said the Highlander; "but her own self comes to buy
an armour.""Her own self's bare shanks may trot hence with her," answered Henry; "I
have none to sell.""If it was not within two days of Palm Sunday, herself would make you
sing another song," retorted the Gael."And being the day it is," said Henry, with the same contemptuous
indifference, "I pray you to stand out of my light.""You are an uncivil person; but her own self is fir nan ord too; and she
knows the smith is fiery when the iron is hot.""If her nainsell be hammer man herself, her nainsell may make her nain
harness," replied Henry."And so her nainsell would, and never fash you for the matter; but it
is said, Gow Chrom, that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords and
harnishes that you work, that have power to make the blades cut steel
links as if they were paper, and the plate and mail turn back steel
lances as if they were boddle prins?""They tell your ignorance any nonsense that Christian men refuse to
believe," said Henry."I whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost,
like an honest craftsman, and commonly it is the Highlandman's 'Och hone
for Houghman stares!'"Friend, it is but idle to spur a horse when his legs are ham shackled,"
said the Highlander, haughtily."Her own self cannot fight even now, and
there is little gallantry in taunting her thus.""By nails and hammer, you are right there," said the smith, altering his
tone."But speak out at once, friend, what is it thou wouldst have of
me?I am in no humour for dallying.""A hauberk for her chief, Eachin MacIan," said the Highlander."You are a hammer man, you say?said our
smith, producing from a chest the mail shirt on which he had been lately
employed.The Gael handled it with a degree of admiration which had something of
envy in it.He looked curiously at every part of its texture, and at
length declared it the very best piece of armour that he had ever seen."A hundred cows and bullocks and a good drift of sheep would be e'en
ower cheap an offer," said the Highlandman, by way of tentative; "but
her nainsell will never bid thee less, come by them how she can.""It is a fair proffer," replied Henry; "but gold nor gear will never buy
that harness.I want to try my own sword on my own armour, and I will
not give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of
three blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief's upon
these terms.""Hut, prut, man--take a drink and go to bed," said the Highlander, in
great scorn.Think ye the captain of the Clan Quhele will
be brawling and battling with a bit Perth burgess body like you?Whisht,
man, and hearken.Her nainsell will do ye mair credit than ever belonged
to your kin.She will fight you for the fair harness hersell.""She must first show that she is my match," said Henry, with a grim
smile.I, one of Eachin MacIan's leichtach, and not your match!""You may try me, if you will.Do you know
how to cast a sledge hammer?""Ay, truly--ask the eagle if he can fly over Farragon.""But before you strive with me, you must first try a cast with one of my
leichtach.Here, Dunter, stand forth for the honour of Perth!And now,
Highlandman, there stands a row of hammers; choose which you will, and
let us to the garden."The Highlander whose name was Norman nan Ord, or Norman of the Hammer,
showed his title to the epithet by selecting the largest hammer of the
set, at which Henry smiled.Dunter, the stout journeyman of the smith,
made what was called a prodigious cast; but the Highlander, making a
desperate effort, threw beyond it by two or three feet, and looked with
an air of triumph to Henry, who again smiled in reply.said the Gael, offering our smith the hammer."Not with that child's toy," said Henry, "which has scarce weight to
fly against the wind.Jannekin, fetch me Sampson; or one of you help the
boy, for Sampson is somewhat ponderous."The hammer now produced was half as heavy again as that which the
Highlander had selected as one of unusual weight.Norman stood
astonished; but he was still more so when Henry, taking his position,
swung the ponderous implement far behind his right haunch joint, and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown from a warlike engine.The
air groaned and whistled as the mass flew through it.Down at length it
came, and the iron head sunk a foot into the earth, a full yard beyond
the cast of Norman.The Highlander, defeated and mortified, went to the spot where the
weapon lay, lifted it, poised it in his hand with great wonder, and
examined it closely, as if he expected to discover more in it than a
common hammer.He at length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head as the smith asked
him whether he would not mend his cast."Norman has lost too much at the sport already," he replied."She has
lost her own name of the Hammerer.But does her own self, the Gow Chrom,
work at the anvil with that horse's load of iron?""You shall see, brother," said Henry, leading the way to the smithy."Dunter," he said, "rax me that bar from the furnace"; and uplifting
Sampson, as he called the monstrous hammer, he plied the metal with a
hundred strokes from right to left--now with the right hand, now with
the left, now with both, with so much strength at once and dexterity,
that he worked off a small but beautifully proportioned horseshoe in
half the time that an ordinary smith would have taken for the same
purpose, using a more manageable implement.said the Highlander, "and what for would you be fighting
with our young chief, who is far above your standard, though you were
the best smith ever wrought with wind and fire?"said Henry; "you seem a good fellow, and I'll tell you the
truth.Your master has wronged me, and I give him this harness freely
for the chance of fighting him myself.""Nay, if he hath wronged you he must meet you," said the life guardsman."To do a man wrong takes the eagle's feather out of the chief's bonnet;
and were he the first in the Highlands, and to be sure so is Eachin,
he must fight the man he has wronged, or else a rose falls from his
chaplet.""Will you move him to this," said Henry, "after the fight on Sunday?""Oh, her nainsell will do her best, if the hawks have not got her
nainsell's bones to pick; for you must know, brother, that Clan
Chattan's claws pierce rather deep.""The armour is your chief's on that condition," said Henry; "but I will
disgrace him before king and court if he does not pay me the price.""Deil a fear--deil a fear; I will bring him in to the barrace myself,"
said Norman, "assuredly.""You will do me a pleasure," replied Henry; "and that you may remember
your promise, I will bestow on you this dirk.Look--if you hold it
truly, and can strike between the mail hood and the collar of your
enemy, the surgeon will be needless."The Highlander was lavish in his expressions of gratitude, and took his
leave."I have given him the best mail harness I ever wrought," said the smith
to himself, rather repenting his liberality, "for the poor chance
that he will bring his chief into a fair field with me; and then let
Catharine be his who can win her fairly.But much I dread the youth will
find some evasion, unless he have such luck on Palm Sunday as may induce
him to try another combat.That is some hope, however; for I have often,
ere now, seen a raw young fellow shoot up after his first fight from a
dwarf into a giant queller."Thus, with little hope, but with the most determined resolution, Henry
Smith awaited the time that should decide his fate.What made him augur
the worst was the silence both of the glover and of his daughter."They are ashamed," he said, "to confess the truth to me, and therefore
they are silent."Upon the Friday at noon, the two bands of thirty men each, representing
the contending clans, arrived at the several points where they were to
halt for refreshments.The Clan Quhele was entertained hospitably at the rich abbey of Scone,
while the provost regaled their rivals at his Castle of Kinfauns, the
utmost care being taken to treat both parties with the most punctilious
attention, and to afford neither an opportunity of complaining of
partiality.All points of etiquette were, in the mean while, discussed
and settled by the Lord High Constable Errol and the young Earl of
Crawford, the former acting on the part of the Clan Chattan and the
latter patronising the Clan Quhele.Messengers were passing continually
from the one earl to the other, and they held more than: six meetings
within thirty hours, before the ceremonial of the field could be exactly
arranged.Meanwhile, in case of revival of ancient quarrel, many seeds of
which existed betwixt the burghers and their mountain neighbours, a
proclamation commanded the citizens not to approach within half a mile
of the place where the Highlanders were quartered; while on their part
the intended combatants were prohibited from approaching Perth without
special license.Troops were stationed to enforce this order, who did
their charge so scrupulously as to prevent Simon Glover himself, burgess
and citizen of Perth, from approaching the town, because he owned having
come thither at the same time with the champions of Eachin MacIan, and
wore a plaid around him of their check or pattern.This interruption
prevented Simon from seeking out Henry Wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge of all that had happened since their separation, which
intercourse, had it taken place, must have materially altered the
catastrophe of our narrative.On Saturday afternoon another arrival took place, which interested the
city almost as much as the preparations for the expected combat.This
was the approach of the Earl Douglas, who rode through the town with a
troop of only thirty horse, but all of whom were knights and gentlemen
of the first consequence.Men's eyes followed this dreaded peer as they
pursue the flight of an eagle through the clouds, unable to ken the
course of the bird of Jove yet silent, attentive, and as earnest in
observing him as if they could guess the object for which he sweeps
through the firmament; He rode slowly through the city, and passed out
at the northern gate.He next alighted at the Dominican convent and
desired to see the Duke of Albany.The Earl was introduced instantly,
and received by the Duke with a manner which was meant to be graceful
and conciliatory, but which could not conceal both art and inquietude.When the first greetings were over, the Earl said with great gravity:
"I bring you melancholy news.Your Grace's royal nephew, the Duke of
Rothsay, is no more, and I fear hath perished by some foul practices."said the Duke' in confusion--"what practices?Who dared
practise on the heir of the Scottish throne?""'Tis not for me to state how these doubts arise," said Douglas; "but
men say the eagle was killed with an arrow fledged from his own wing,
and the oak trunk rent by a wedge of the same wood.""Earl of Douglas," said the Duke of Albany, "I am no reader of riddles.""Nor am I a propounder of them," said Douglas, haughtily, "Your Grace
will find particulars in these papers worthy of perusal.I will go for
half an hour to the cloister garden, and then rejoin you.""You go not to the King, my lord?""No," answered Douglas; "I trust your Grace will agree with me that we
should conceal this great family misfortune from our sovereign till the
business of tomorrow be decided.""If the King heard of this loss, he
could not witness the combat; and if he appear not in person, these men
are likely to refuse to fight, and the whole work is cast loose.But
I pray you sit down, my lord, while I read these melancholy papers
respecting poor Rothsay."He passed the papers through his hands, turning some over with a hasty
glance, and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the
last importance.When he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this
manner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: "My lord, in these
most melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can
renew the divisions in the King's councils, which were settled by the
last solemn agreement between your lordship and myself.My unhappy
nephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him
a graver judgment.He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that
matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary.""If your Grace," replied the Earl, "sees nothing to disturb the good
understanding which the tranquillity and safety of Scotland require
should exist between us, I am not so ill a friend of my country as to
look closely for such.""I understand you, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany, eagerly."You
hastily judged that I should be offended with your lordship for
exercising your powers of lieutenancy, and punishing the detestable
murderers within my territory of Falkland.Credit me, on the contrary, I
am obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of
these wretches, as it would have broken my heart even to have looked
on them.The Scottish Parliament will inquire, doubtless, into this
sacrilegious deed; and happy am I that the avenging sword has been
in the hand of a man so important as your lordship.Our communication
together, as your lordship must well recollect, bore only concerning a
proposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year
or two had taught him discretion?""Such was certainly your Grace's purpose, as expressed to me," said the
Earl; "I can safely avouch it.""Why, then, noble earl, we cannot be censured because villains, for
their own revengeful ends, appear to have engrafted a bloody termination
on our honest purpose?""The Parliament will judge it after their wisdom," said Douglas."For my
part, my conscience acquits me.""And mine assoilzies me," said the Duke with solemnity."Now, my lord,
touching the custody of the boy James, who succeeds to his father's
claims of inheritance?""The King must decide it," said Douglas, impatient of the conference."I will consent to his residence anywhere save at Stirling, Doune, or
Falkland.""He is gone," muttered the crafty Albany, "and he must be my ally, yet
feels himself disposed to be my mortal foe.No matter, Rothsay sleeps
with his fathers, James may follow in time, and then--a crown is the
recompense of my perplexities."Thretty for thretty faucht in barreris,
     At Sanct Johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris.At an earlier period of the Christian Church,
the use of any of the days of Passion Week for the purpose of combat
would have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication.The
Church of Rome, to her infinite honour, had decided that during the holy
season of Easter, when the redemption of man from his fallen state was
accomplished, the sword of war should be sheathed, and angry monarchs
should respect the season termed the Truce of God.The ferocious
violence of the latter wars betwixt Scotland and England had destroyed
all observance of this decent and religious Ordinance.Very often the
most solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack, because
they hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided
for defence.Thus the truce, once considered as proper to the season,
had been discontinued; and it became not unusual even to select the
sacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat, to
which this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance.On the present occasion, however, the duties of the day were observed
with the usual solemnity, and the combatants themselves took share in
them.Bearing branches of yew in their hands, as the readiest substitute
for palm boughs, they marched respectively to the Dominican and
Carthusian convents, to hear High Mass, and, by a show at least of
devotion, to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day.Great
care had of course been taken that, during this march, they should not
even come within the sound of each other's bagpipes; for it was certain
that, like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance, they would
have sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place
of combat.The citizens of Perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the
streets, and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their
devotions, to witness their behaviour, and to form a judgment from
their appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in
the approaching conflict.Their demeanour in the church, although not
habitual frequenters of places of devotion, was perfectly decorous; and,
notwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions, there were few of
the mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder.They appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify
either curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then
presented to them for the first time.On the issue of the combat, few even of the most competent judges dared
venture a prediction; although the great size of Torquil and his eight
stalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes
and sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of
the Clan Quhele.The opinion of the female sex was much decided by
the handsome form, noble countenance, and gallant demeanour of Eachin
MacIan.There were more than one who imagined they had recollection
of his features, but his splendid military attire rendered the humble
glover's apprentice unrecognisable in the young Highland chief, saving
by one person.That person, as may well be supposed, was the Smith of the Wynd, who
had been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant
champions of Clan Quhele.It was with mingled feelings of dislike,
jealousy, and something approaching to admiration that he saw the
glover's apprentice stripped of his mean slough, and blazing forth as a
chieftain, who, by his quick eye and gallant demeanour, the noble shape
of his brow and throat, his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs,
seemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live
or die for the honour of their race.The smith could hardly think that
he looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as
he might a wasp that stung him, and, in mere compassion, forebore to
despatch by treading on him."He looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk," thus muttered Henry to
himself, "the best I ever wrought.Yet, if he and I stood together where
there was neither hand to help nor eye to see, by all that is blessed in
this holy church, the good harness should return to its owner!All that
I am worth would I give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my
own best work; but such happiness will never be mine.If he escape from
the conflict, it will be with so high a character for courage, that he
may well disdain to put his fortune, in its freshness, to the risk of
an encounter with a poor burgess like myself.He will fight by his
champion, and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer, when all
I can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a Highland bullock on the
head.I will to the other church in
quest of him, since for sure he must have come down from the Highlands."The congregation was moving from the church of the Dominicans when the
smith formed this determination, which he endeavoured to carry into
speedy execution, by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the
solemnity of the place and occasion would permit.In making his way
through the press, he was at one instant carried so close to Eachin
that their eyes encountered.The smith's hardy and embrowned countenance
 up like the heated iron on which he wrought, and retained
its dark red hue for several minutes.Eachin's features glowed with a
brighter blush of indignation, and a glance of fiery hatred was shot
from his eyes.But the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness, and his
gaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was
encountered.Torquil, whose eye never quitted his foster son, saw his emotion, and
looked anxiously around to discover the cause.But Henry was already
at a distance, and hastening on his way to the Carthusian convent.Here
also the religious service of the day was ended; and those who had so
lately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace
on earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to
the place of combat--some prepared to take the lives of their fellow
creatures or to lose their own, others to view the deadly strife with
the savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their
gladiators.The crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired
of making way through it.But the general deference entertained for
Henry of the Wynd, as the champion of Perth, and the universal sense of
his ability to force a passage, induced all to unite in yielding room
for him, so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the
Clan Chattan.Their pipers marched at the head of their column.Next
followed the well known banner, displaying a mountain cat rampant, with
the appropriate caution, "Touch not the cat, but (i.e.The chief followed with his two handed sword advanced, as if to
protect the emblem of the tribe.He was a man of middle stature, more
than fifty years old, but betraying neither in features nor form any
decay of strength or symptoms of age.His dark red close curled locks
were in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs, but his step and gesture
were as light in the dance, in the chase, or in the battle as if he had
not passed his thirtieth year.His grey eye gleamed with a wild light
expressive of valour and ferocity mingled; but wisdom and experience
dwelt on the expression of his forehead, eyebrows, and lips.The chosen
champions followed by two and two.There was a cast of anxiety on
several of their faces, for they had that morning discovered the absence
of one of their appointed number; and, in a contest so desperate as was
expected, the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their
high mettled chief, MacGillie Chattanach."Say nothing to the Saxons of his absence," said this bold leader, when
the diminution of his force was reported to him."The false Lowland
tongues might say that one of Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps
that the rest favoured his escape, in order to have a pretence to avoid
the battle.I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere
we are ready for battle; or, if he should not, am not I man enough for
two of the Clan Quhele?or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty,
rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?"The tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause, yet
there were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of
the deserter; and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the
determined band who was totally indifferent on the subject.They marched on through the streets without seeing anything of Ferquhard
Day, who, many a mile beyond the mountains, was busied in receiving such
indemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour.MacGillie Chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence
of the deserter, and entered upon the North Inch, a beautiful and level
plain, closely adjacent to the city, and appropriated to the martial
exercises of the inhabitants.The plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling Tay.There was
erected within it a strong palisade, inclosing on three sides a space of
one hundred and fifty yards in length and seventy-four yards in width.The fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced
by the river.An amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators
surrounded the palisade, leaving a large space free to be occupied by
armed men on foot and horseback, and for the more ordinary class of
spectators.At the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city,
there was a range of elevated galleries for the King and his courtiers,
so highly decorated with rustic treillage, intermingled with gilded
ornaments, that the spot retains to this day the name of the Golden, or
Gilded, Arbour.The mountain minstrelsy, which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or
battle tunes of the rival confederacies, was silent when they entered on
the Inch, for such was the order which had been given.Two stately but
aged warriors, each bearing the banner of his tribe, advanced to the
opposite extremities of the lists, and, pitching their standards into
the earth, prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not
to join.The pipers, who were also to be neutral in the strife, took
their places by their respective brattachs.The multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which
on similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect
amusement, or what they term sport.The destined combatants returned
no answer to this greeting, but each party advanced to the opposite
extremities of the lists, where were entrances by which they were to be
admitted to the interior.A strong body of men at arms guarded either
access; and the Earl Marshal at the one and the Lord High Constable at
the other carefully examined each individual, to see whether he had the
appropriate arms, being steel cap, mail shirt, two handed sword, and
dagger.They also examined the numbers of each party; and great was the
alarm among the multitude when the Earl of Errol held up his hand and
cried: "Ho!The combat cannot proceed, for the Clan Chattan lack one of
their number."said the young Earl of Crawford; "they should have
counted better ere they left home."The Earl Marshal, however, agreed with the Constable that the fight
could not proceed until the inequality should be removed; and a general
apprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that, after all the
preparation, there would be no battle.Of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect
of the combat being adjourned, and these were the captain of the Clan
Quhele and the tender hearted King Robert.Meanwhile the two chiefs,
each attended by a special friend and adviser, met in the midst of the
lists, having, to assist them in determining what was to be done, the
Earl Marshal, the Lord High Constable, the Earl of Crawford, and Sir
Patrick Charteris.The chief of the Clan Chattan declared himself
willing and desirous of fighting upon the spot, without regard to the
disparity of numbers."That," said Torquil of the Oak, "Clan Quhele will never consent to.You can never win honour from us with the sword, and you seek but a
subterfuge, that you may say when you are defeated, as you know you will
be, that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out.But I make a proposal: Ferquhard Day was the youngest of your band,
Eachin MacIan is the youngest of ours; we will set him aside in place of
the man who has fled from the combat.""A most unjust and unequal proposal," exclaimed Toshach Beg, the second,
as he might be termed, of MacGillie Chattanach."The life of the chief
is to the clan the breath of our nostrils, nor will we ever consent that
our chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of Clan Quhele
does not share."Torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the
objection was made to Hector's being withdrawn from the battle, and
he was meditating how to support his proposal, when Eachin himself
interfered.His timidity, it must be observed, was not of that sordid
and selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly
to submit to dishonour rather than risk danger.On the contrary, he was
morally brave, though constitutionally timid, and the shame of avoiding
the combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing
it."I will not hear," he said, "of a scheme which will leave my sword
sheathed during this day's glorious combat.If I am young in arms, there
are enough of brave men around me whom I may imitate if I cannot equal."He spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on Torquil, and perhaps
on the young chief himself."I was sure the foul spell would be broken through, and that the tardy
spirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the
first flutter of the brattach!""Hear me, Lord Marshal," said the Constable."The hour of combat may not
be much longer postponed, for the day approaches to high noon.Let the
chief of Clan Chattan take the half hour which remains, to find, if he
can, a substitute for this deserter; if he cannot, let them fight as
they stand.""Content I am," said the Marshal, "though, as none of his own clan are
nearer than fifty miles, I see not how MacGillis Chattanach is to find
an auxiliary.""That is his business," said the High Constable; "but, if he offers a
high reward, there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists,
who will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is
expected.I myself, did my quality and charge permit, would blythely
take a turn of work amongst these wild fellows, and think it fame won."They communicated their decision to the Highlanders, and the chief of
the Clan Chattan replied: "You have judged unpartially and nobly, my
lords, and I deem myself obliged to follow your direction.So make
proclamation, heralds, that, if any one will take his share with Clan
Chattan of the honours and chances of this day, he shall have present
payment of a gold crown, and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks.""You are something chary of your treasure, chief," said the Earl
Marshal: "a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you.""If there be any man willing to fight for honour," replied MacGillis
Chattanach, "the price will be enough; and I want not the service of a
fellow who draws his sword for gold alone."The heralds had made their progress, moving half way round the lists,
stopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been
directed, without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one
to accept of the proffered enlistment.Some sneered at the poverty of
the Highlanders, who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service.Others affected resentment, that they should esteem the blood of
citizens so lightly.None showed the slightest intention to undertake
the task proposed, until the sound of the proclamation reached Henry of
the Wynd, as he stood without the barrier, speaking from time to time
with Baillie Craigdallie, or rather listening vaguely to what the
magistrate was saying to him."A liberal offer on the part of MacGillie Chattanach," said the host of
the Griffin, "who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat
for the day, and be killed a little in his service!exclaimed the smith, eagerly, "do they make proclamation for a
man to fight against the Clan Quhele?""Ay, marry do they," said Griffin; "but I think they will find no such
fools in Perth."He had hardly said the word, when he beheld the smith clear the barriers
at a single bound and alight in the lists, saying: "Here am I, sir
herald, Henry of the Wynd, willing to battle on the part of the Clan
Chattan."A cry of admiration ran through the multitude, while the grave burghers,
not being able to conceive the slightest reason for Henry's behaviour,
concluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of
fighting."Thou art mad," he said, "Henry!Thou hast neither two handed sword nor
shirt of mail.""Truly no," said Henry, "for I parted with a mail shirt, which I had
made for myself, to yonder gay chief of the Clan Quhele, who will soon
find on his shoulders with what sort of blows I clink my rivets!As for
two handed sword, why, this boy's brand will serve my turn till I can
master a heavier one.""This must not be," said Errol."Hark thee, armourer, by St.Mary, thou
shalt have my Milan hauberk and good Spanish sword.""I thank your noble earlship, Sir Gilbert Hay, but the yoke with which
your brave ancestor turned the battle at Loncarty would serve my turn
well enough.I am little used to sword or harness that I have not
wrought myself, because I do not well know what blows the one will bear
out without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping."The cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into
the town, that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour,
when, just as the fated hour was approaching, the shrill voice of a
female was heard screaming for passage through the crowd.The multitude
gave place to her importunity, and she advanced, breathless with haste
under the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword.The
widow of Oliver Proudfute was soon recognised, and the arms which she
bore were those of the smith himself, which, occupied by her husband on
the fatal evening when he was murdered, had been naturally conveyed
to his house with the dead body, and were now, by the exertions of
his grateful widow, brought to the lists at a moment when such proved
weapons were of the last consequence to their owner.Henry joyfully
received the well known arms, and the widow with trembling haste
assisted in putting them on, and then took leave of him, saying: "God
for the champion of the widow and orphan, and ill luck to all who come
before him!"Confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour, Henry shook
himself as if to settle the steel shirt around him, and, unsheathing
the two handed sword, made it flourish over his head, cutting the air
through which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease
and sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could
wield the ponderous weapon.The champions were now ordered to march
in their turns around the lists, crossing so as to avoid meeting each
other, and making obeisance as they passed the Golden Arbour where the
King was seated.While this course was performing, most of the spectators were again
curiously comparing the stature, limbs, and sinews of the two parties,
and endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the
combat.The feud of a hundred years, with all its acts of aggression
and retaliation, was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant.Their
countenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of
pride, hate, and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last.The spectators murmured a joyful applause, in high wrought expectation
of the bloody game.Wagers were offered and accepted both on the general
issue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions.The
clear, frank, and elated look of Henry Smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators, and odds, to use the modern expression,
were taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself
fell.Scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat, when the commands of the
chiefs ordered the champions into their places; and at the same moment
Henry heard the voice of Simon Glover issuing from the crowd, who were
now silent with expectation, and calling on him: "Harry Smith--Harry
Smith, what madness hath possessed thee?""Ay, he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is, or is to be, from
the smith's handling," was Henry's first thought; his second was to turn
and speak with him; and his third, that he could on no pretext desert
the band which he had joined, or even seem desirous to delay the fight,
consistently with honour.He turned himself, therefore, to the business of the hour.Both parties
were disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines, each containing
ten men.They were arranged with such intervals between each individual
as offered him scope to wield his sword, the blade of which was five
feet long, not including the handle.The second and third lines were
to come up as reserves, in case the first experienced disaster.On the
right of the array of Clan Quhele, the chief, Eachin MacIan, placed
himself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers.Four of
them occupied the right of the first line, whilst the father and
two others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain.Torquil, in
particular, kept close behind, for the purpose of covering him.Thus
Eachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band,
having four especial defenders in front, one on each hand, and three in
his rear.The line of the Clan Chattan was arranged in precisely the same order,
only that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank, instead of
being on the extreme right.This induced Henry Smith, who saw in the
opposing bands only one enemy, and that was the unhappy Eachin, to
propose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the Clan
Chattan.But the leader disapproved of this arrangement; and having
reminded Henry that he owed him obedience, as having taken wages at his
hand, he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately
behind himself--a post of honour, certainly, which Henry could not
decline, though he accepted of it with reluctance.When the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other, they intimated
their feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream,
which, uttered by the Clan Quhele, was answered and echoed back by
the Clan Chattan, the whole at the same time shaking their swords and
menacing each other, as if they meant to conquer the imagination of
their opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife.At this trying moment, Torquil, who had never feared for himself, was
agitated with alarm on the part of his dault, yet consoled by observing
that he kept a determined posture, and that the few words which he spoke
to his clan were delivered boldly, and well calculated to animate them
to combat, as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death
or victory.The trumpets
of the King sounded a charge, the bagpipes blew up their screaming and
maddening notes, and the combatants, starting forward in regular order,
and increasing their pace till they came to a smart run, met together
in the centre of the ground, as a furious land torrent encounters an
advancing tide.For an instant or two the front lines, hewing at each other with their
long swords, seemed engaged in a succession of single combats; but the
second and third ranks soon came up on either side, actuated alike by
the eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour, pressed through the
intervals, and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos, over which the
huge swords rose and sunk, some still glittering, others streaming with
blood, appearing, from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed,
rather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to
be wielded by human hands.Some of the combatants, too much crowded
together to use those long weapons, had already betaken themselves to
their poniards, and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those
opposed to them.In the mean time, blood flowed fast, and the groans of
those who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought; for,
according to the manner of the Highlanders at all times, they could
hardly be said to shout, but to yell.Those of the spectators whose
eyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could
nevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party.The
conflict swayed, indeed, at different intervals forwards or backwards,
but it was only in momentary superiority, which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side.The wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult, and
stimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants.At once, however, and as if by mutual agreement, the instruments sounded
a retreat; it was expressed in wailing notes, which seemed to imply a
dirge for the fallen.The two parties disengaged themselves from each
other, to take breath for a few minutes.The eyes of the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew
off from the contest, but found it still impossible to decide which had
sustained the greater loss.It seemed as if the Clan Chattan had lost
rather fewer men than their antagonists; but in compensation, the bloody
plaids and skirts of their party (for several on both sides had thrown
their mantles away) showed more wounded men than the Clan Quhele.About
twenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying; and arms and legs
lopped off, heads cleft to the chin, slashes deep through the shoulder
into the breast, showed at once the fury of the combat, the ghastly
character of the weapons used, and the fatal strength of the arms which
wielded them.The chief of the Clan Chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage, and was slightly wounded.Eachin also had
fought with spirit, surrounded by his bodyguard.His sword was bloody,
his bearing bold and warlike; and he smiled when old Torquil, folding
him in his arms, loaded him with praises and with blessings.The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space
of about ten minutes, again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly
one third of their original number.They now chose their ground nearer
to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered, which
was encumbered with the wounded and the slain.Some of the former were
observed, from time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of
the field, and sink back, most of them to die from the effusion of blood
which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as
his remaining on the spot where they had first encountered, where he
stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose bonneted head, carried
to ten yards' distance from the body by the force of the blow which had
swept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the
bodyguard of Eachin MacIan.Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck
a blow, but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself, and some which were aimed at the chief.MacGillie Chattanach
became alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again
draw together, he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a
distance from the ranks, and showed little disposition to join them."Can so strong a body have a mean
and cowardly spirit?"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry."If I am
such," pointing to the headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day's
wage.""He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I
reward him without reckoning wages.""Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which
best likes me.""All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who
saw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise."It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined
the rest of the combatants with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to
the chief of the Clan Quhele.It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty.He had long looked up to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its
neighbourhood could bring into the lists.His hatred to him as a rival
was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once, though
unarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld
him with his eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his
hand, and obviously meditating an attack on him individually, his
courage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape his
foster father.It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation
of his own temper, and that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive
the idea of one of his own tribe, much less of his chief and foster
son, being deficient in animal courage.Could he have imagined this, his
grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking
Eachin's life, to save him from staining his honour.But his mind
rejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward, as something
which was monstrous and unnatural.That he was under the influence of
enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now
anxiously, but in a whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now
darken thy spirit, Eachin?""Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands
the fell enchanter!"exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making?Norman,
miserable boy, why brought you that accursed mail?""If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it,"
answered Norman nan Ord."Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell.""Yes, stand firm," said Torquil."He may be a fell enchanter; but my own
ear has heard, and my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the
battle whole, free, and unwounded; let us see the Saxon wizard who can
gainsay that.He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of the oak
shall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault.Ring
around him, my sons; bas air son Eachin!"The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for
Hector."Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called
boldly to the minstrels of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached
each other more slowly than at first, as men who knew and respected
each other's valour.Henry Wynd, in his impatience to begin the contest,
advanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on.Norman, however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there
was a general, though momentary, pause, as if both parties were willing
to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel.The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to
strike; but, just as he came within sword's length, he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the smith's sword, as he fetched
a cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within Henry's guard,
struck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat,
directing the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the
same time, "You taught me the stab!"But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining
of tempered steel.Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been
ended for ever.Even as it was, he was slightly wounded.he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long
sword, which made him stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust,
but not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at his antagonist, which cleft
his skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body to
engage the young chief, who now stood open before him.But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son
Eachin!"and the two brethren who flanked their
chief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking both at
once, compelled him to keep the defensive.cried MacGillie Chattanach."Save the
brave Saxon; let these kites feel your talons!"Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith's
assistance, and cut down one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed.Henry's own good sword rid him of the other.answered two more of his
devoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those
who had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of
the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show
of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers.The two children
of the oak, who had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their
brethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan chief had drawn to that part
of the field some of his bravest warriors.The sons of Torquil did not
fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons
of the dead and living.But the necessity of keeping their most
distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to
disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now
the number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan
Chattan had fifteen of their number left, though most of them wounded,
and that of the Clan Quhele only about ten remained, of whom there were
four of the chief's bodyguard, including Torquil himself.They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed,
their fury seemed to increase.Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places,
was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold
hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity.But still the father's shout of "Another for Hector!"was cheerfully
answered by the fatal countersign, "Death for Hector!"and though the
Clan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious.It
was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or
three were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords.Five
were left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his youngest son were of the
number, both slightly wounded.Eachin alone had, from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without
injury.The rage of both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into
sullen desperation.They walked staggering, as if in their sleep,
through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to
animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the
friends they had lost.The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict
drawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the
river, as the spot least slippery with blood, and less encumbered with
the bodies of the slain."For God's sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for,"
said the kind hearted old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be
ended!Wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be
suffered to complete their butchery?Surely they will now be ruled, and
accept of peace on moderate terms?""Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother."These men are the pest
of the Lowlands.Both chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed,
the whole day's work is cast away.Remember your promise to the council,
that you would not cry 'hold.'""You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should
protect his subjects, and as a Christian man, who respects the brother
of his faith.""You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving
subjects, but disobedient rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear
witness; and they are still less Christian men, for the prior of the
Dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen.""You must work your pleasure, and are too wise
for me to contend with.I can but turn away and shut my eyes from the
sights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken.But well I know
that God will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life.""Sound, trumpets," said Albany; "their wounds will stiffen if they dally
longer."While this was passing, Torquil was embracing and encouraging his young
chief."Resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer!Be of good cheer, you
will come off without either scar or scratch, wem or wound."How can I be of good cheer," said Eachin, "while my brave kinsmen have
one by one died at my feet--died all for me, who could never deserve the
least of their kindness?""And for what were they born, save to die for their chief?""Why lament that the arrow returns not to the
quiver, providing it hit the mark?Here are Tormot and I
but little hurt, while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain
as if they were half throttled by the terriers.Yet one brave stand, and
the day shall be your own, though it may well be that you alone remain
alive.The pipers on both sides blew their charge, and the combatants again
mingled in battle, not indeed with the same strength, but with unabated
inveteracy.They were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained
neuter, but who now found themselves unable to do so.The two old
champions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the
extremity of the lists, and now approached close to the immediate scene
of action.When they beheld the carnage more nearly, they were mutually
impelled by the desire to revenge their brethren, or not to survive
them.They attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the
standards were attached, closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts,
then grappled in close strife, still holding their banners, until at
length, in the eagerness of their conflict, they fell together into the
Tay, and were found drowned after the combat, closely locked in each
other's arms.The fury of battle, the frenzy of rage and despair,
infected next the minstrels.The two pipers, who, during the conflict,
had done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren, now saw
the dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it.They
threw down their instruments, rushed desperately upon each other with
their daggers, and each being more intent on despatching his opponent
than in defending himself, the piper of Clan Quhele was almost instantly
slain and he of Clan Chattan mortally wounded.The last, nevertheless,
again grasped his instrument, and the pibroch of the clan yet poured
its expiring notes over the Clan Chattan, while the dying minstrel had
breath to inspire it.The instrument which he used, or at least that
part of it called the chanter, is preserved in the family of a Highland
chief to this day, and is much honoured under the name of the federan
dhu, or, "black chanter."'Meanwhile, in the final charge, young Tormot, devoted, like his
brethren, by his father Torquil to the protection of his chief, had
been mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith.The other
two remaining of the Clan Quhele had also fallen, and Torquil, with his
foster son and the wounded Tormot, forced to retreat before eight or ten
of the Clan Chattan, made a stand on the bank of the river, while their
enemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come
up with them.Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved
to make the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired.His death
drew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed
throughout the eventful day.he said, "my youngest and dearest!But if I save
Hector, I save all.Now, my darling dault, I have done for thee all that
man may, excepting the last.Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened
armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit
thee well.While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make
what play with them I can.I trust I shall have but little to do, for
they are following each other like disabled steers.At least, darling of
my soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man should
die."While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief's
hauberk, in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which
fear and necromancy had twined about his heart."My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin,
"stay with me!With you by my side, I feel I can fight to the last.""It is impossible," said Torquil."I will stop them coming up, while you
put on the hauberk.God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward
with the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody
field, "Bas air son Eachin!"The words rung three times in a voice of
thunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of
the Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him."Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!"exclaimed the multitude,
as they witnessed exertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to
threaten a change of the fortunes of the day.Suddenly these cries were
hushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful,
as if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and
Torquil of the Oak.They cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had
drawn their blades for the first time that day; and their inveteracy was
mutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed, had
cast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who,
during the whole conflict, had interrupted the purpose for which alone
he had joined the combatants--that of engaging in single combat with
Hector.They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have
existed, had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat
deprived of his usual agility.Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain
attempt to put on his foster brother's harness, became animated by an
emotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward to support his foster
father in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan
should come up.When he was within five yards, and sternly determined
to take his share in the death fight, his foster father fell, cleft
from the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring with his last
breath, "Bas air son Eachin!"The unfortunate youth saw the fall of
his last friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had
hunted him through the whole field standing within sword's point of
him, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his
life through so many obstacles.Perhaps this was enough to bring his
constitutional timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected
at the same moment that he was without defensive armour, and that a
line of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge and
blood, were closely approaching.It is enough to say, that his heart
sickened, his eyes darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy,
all other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death;
and, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that which
was aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former
could recover his weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay.A roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river, although,
perhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved
otherwise in the like circumstances.Henry looked after the fugitive in
silence and surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of
his flight, on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him
as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided.He sat down on
the grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were
pouring fastest.The victors had the general meed of gratulation.The Duke of Albany and
others went down to survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with
particular notice."If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I
will change thy leathern apron for a knight's girdle, and thy burgage
tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal.""I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have
shed blood enough already, and Heaven has punished me by foiling the
only purpose for which I entered the combat.""Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan,
and have they not gained a glorious conquest?""I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own
pleasure, not for your profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the
expression is still proverbial in Scotland.The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered
the barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after."My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal
matters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that
are spiritual.Has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily
wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?""He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir
Patrick Charteris, "and I esteem myself one of the closest.""A churl will savour of churl's kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning
his horse aside; "the proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas
had recalled him from death's door, had there been a drop of gentle
blood in his body."Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns
dismounted to take Henry in his arms, as he now sunk back from very
faintness.But he was prevented by Simon Glover, who, with other
burgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace."Oh, what tempted you
to this fatal affray?"No--not speechless," said Henry."Catharine--" He could utter no more."Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"

"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who,
though something affronted at Henry's rejection of his offer, was too
magnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing."She is safe,
if Douglas's banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich.Douglas
can give wealth to those who value it more than honour.""For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a
father go with the noble Douglas.said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises
gold!""Under your lordship's favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight
and noble, take license to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may
reject honourable titles, such an honest man as this reverend citizen
may dispense with gold.""You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no
offence," said the Douglas.But," he
added, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw the King from
this bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over
broad Scotland when tomorrow dawns.Yet even I
grieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie here slain, whose brands might
have decided a pitched field in their country's cause."With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running
down his aged cheeks and white beard, as he conjured all around him,
nobles and priests, that care should be taken for the bodies and souls
of the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to
the slain.The priests who were present answered zealously for both
services, and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously.Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth.Of
sixty-four brave men (the minstrels and standard bearers included)
who strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone survived, who were
conveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the
dead and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession
which conveyed them from the scene of their strife.Eachin alone had
left it void of wounds and void of honour.It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the
bloody combat except the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the
defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.The clans of which it
consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after
this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner.The
Clan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and
the best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the
race of the Cat a Mountain.While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied,
Albany, with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of
Douglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this most melancholy scene at
Falkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?""Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas."I would sooner bare my
breast, within flight shot, as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen.I could but say I saw the ill fated youth dead.How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.Were it
not for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own
mind of it."So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to
his own lodgings, leaving Albany to tell his tale as he best could."Ay, and
thine own interest, haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou
darest not separate from mine.Well, since the task falls on me, I must
and will discharge it."The King looked at him with
surprise after he had assumed his usual seat."Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King."I would thou
wouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled, since its
consequences affect thee so powerfully.And yet, Robin, I love thee the
better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy
reflecting policy.""I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half
choked, "that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see
or hear of this day.I should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who
lie piled on it like carrion.It must
be--it is Rothsay!"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless
nephew.""Albany, as
thy brother, I conjure thee!But no, I am thy brother no longer.As thy
king, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to tell the worst."Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but
the certainty is, that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment
last night from sudden illness--as I have heard.""Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David!Would to God I had died for thee,
my son--my son!"So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft
father, tearing his grey beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless
and conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his
grief.But the agony of the King's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fury--a mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature,
that the remorse of Albany was drowned in his fear."And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious
maxims!But the besotted father who gave the son into thy hands--who
gave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king, and thou shalt know
it to thy cost.Shall the murderer stand in presence of his
brother--stained with the blood of that brother's son?What ho,
without there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes!Take arms, if
you love the Stuart!"MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment."Brandanes, your
noble Prince--" Here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment
the fatal information it was his object to convey.At length he resumed
his broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard!Arrest--" The word choked his utterance."Arrest whom, my noble liege?"said MacLouis, who, observing the King
influenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his
ordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed
by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed."Whom shall I arrest, my liege?""Here is none but your
Grace's royal brother of Albany.""Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion
soon dying away."Most true--none but Albany--none but my parent's
child--none but my brother.O God, enable me to quell the sinful passion
which glows in this bosom.Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who
endeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy,
and muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has been too much for
his understanding."not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?""The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?"exclaimed the faithful
Brandane, with the utmost horror and astonishment."Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye
and determined look, said to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his
mental devotion: "My liege!a minute or two since you left a word--one
word--unspoken.Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your
Brandanes!""I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken
King, "and you bring it to me.Would you arm a madman with a
drawn weapon?my friend--my brother--my bosom
counsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"Albany, seeing that the King's mood was softening, replied with more
firmness than before: "My castle has no barrier against the power of
death.I have not deserved the foul suspicions which your Majesty's
words imply.I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation,
by the souls of our royal parents--"

"Be silent, Robert!"said the King: "add not perjury to murder.And was
this all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre?Take them
to thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as I have done, that they are
both of red hot iron!thou hast at least escaped
being a king!""My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre
of Scotland are, when your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of
Prince James, who succeeds to his brother's rights.""True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child,
to his brother's perils!You have reminded
me that I have still work upon earth.Get thy Brandanes under arms with
what speed thou canst.Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to
thee.None in especial who has trafficked with the Duke of Albany--that
man, I mean, who calls himself my brother--and order my litter to
be instantly prepared.We will to Dunbarton, MacLouis, or to Bute.Precipices, and tides, and my Brandanes' hearts shall defend the child
till we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncle's ambition.Farewell, Robert of Albany--farewell for ever, thou hard hearted, bloody
man!Enjoy such share of power as the Douglas may permit thee.But seek
not to see my face again, far less to approach my remaining child; for,
that hour thou dost, my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with
their partizans!The Duke of Albany left the presence without attempting further
justification or reply.In the ensuing Parliament, the Duke
of Albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death
of Rothsay, while, at the same time, he showed his own sense of guilt by
taking out a remission or pardon for the offence.The unhappy and aged
monarch secluded himself in his Castle of Rothsay, in Bute, to mourn
over the son he had lost, and watch with feverish anxiety over the life
of him who remained.As the best step for the youthful James's security,
he sent him to France to receive his education at the court of the
reigning sovereign.But the vessel in which the Prince of Scotland
sailed was taken by an English cruiser, and, although there was a truce
for the moment betwixt the kingdoms, Henry IV ungenerously detained him
a prisoner.This last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy
King Robert III.Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the
treachery and cruelty of his brother.Robert of Albany's own grey hairs
went, indeed, in peace to the grave, and he transferred the regency
which he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch.But, nineteen years
after the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and
Duke Murdoch of Albany, with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in
expiation of his father's guilt and his own.The honest heart that's free frae a'
     Intended fraud or guile,
     However Fortune kick the ba',
     Has aye some cause to smile.We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the
horrible scene at Falkland by order of the Douglas, to be placed under
the protection of his daughter, the now widowed Duchess of Rothsay.That
lady's temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the
ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay.It arose on
the summit of a precipitous rock, which descends on the princely river,
there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called Campsie
Linn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic
rock, which intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands.Delighted with a site so romantic, the monks of the abbey of Cupar
reared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named St.Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or
devotion.It had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who
was its present inmate, as the country was under the influence of
the powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas.There the Earl's
letters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which
conducted Catharine and the glee maiden to Campsie.Whatever reason
she might have to complain of Rothsay, his horrible and unexpected end
greatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part of the
night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she
ordered Catharine Glover and the minstrel into her presence.The spirits
of both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful
scenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward
appearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more
calculated to inspire awe than confidence.She spoke with kindness,
however, though apparently in deep affliction, and learned from them
all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and
inconsiderate husband.She appeared grateful for the efforts which
Catharine and the glee maiden had made, at their own extreme peril, to
save Rothsay from his horrible fate.She invited them to join in her
devotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and
dismissed them to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in
particular, of her efficient protection, which should include, she said,
her father's, and be a wall around them both, so long as she herself
lived.They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of
a repast with her duennas and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound
sorrow, showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart
of the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious
character of Catharine Glover.The friends, for so we may now term them,
were fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all
of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with
a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with
pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.A little
garden, with its bushes and fruit trees, advanced on one side of the
convent, so as to skirt the precipice, from which it was only separated
by a parapet built on the ledge of the rock, so low that the eye might
easily measure the depth of the crag, and gaze on the conflicting waters
which foamed, struggled, and chafed over the reef below.The Fair Maiden of Perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that
ran within this parapet, looked at the romantic prospect, and judged
what it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with
leaves.At length the gay
and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which
she had been and was now placed."Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits?Strive to forget them as I do: we cannot tread life's path lightly, if
we shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall.""These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine."Yet my
mind is at present anxious respecting my father's safety; and I cannot
but think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world,
even within six miles of us, or little farther.""You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas's
equerry told us yesterday?It were a sight for a minstrel to witness.But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could never see swords
cross each other without being dazzled.But see--look yonder, May
Catharine--look yonder!That flying messenger certainly brings news of
the battle.""Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine."But if
it be he I think of, some wild thoughts are urging his speed."As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden.Louise's
little dog ran to meet him, barking furiously, but came back, to
cower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for even dumb animals can
distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible
passion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career.The
fugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace.His head was
bare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and all his other vestments
looked as if they had been lately drenched in water.His leathern
buskins were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood.His
countenance was wild, haggard, and highly excited, or, as the Scottish
phrase expresses it, much "raised."said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing
what was before him, as hares are said to do when severely pressed by
the greyhounds.But he stopped short when he heard his own name."Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all
this?Have the Clan Quhele sustained a defeat?""I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive,
after a moment's recollection."Yes, I was called Conachar when I was
happy, and Eachin when I was powerful.But now I have no name, and there
is no such clan as thou speak'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to
speak of that which is not to one who has no existence."unfortunate--"

"And why unfortunate, I pray you?""If I am coward
and villain, have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements?Have I not braved the water without its choking me, and trod the firm
earth without its opening to devour me?He will not
harm me; but I fear he will do evil to himself.See how he stares down
on the roaring waterfall!"The glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered, and Conachar's half
frenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence."Catharine," he said, "now she is gone, I will say I know thee--I know
thy love of peace and hatred of war.But hearken; I have, rather than
strike a blow at my enemy, given up all that a man calls dearest: I have
lost honour, fame, and friends, and such friends!(he placed his hands
before his face).All know my shame; all should see my sorrow.Yes, all
might see, but who would pity it?Catharine, as I ran like a madman down
the strath, man and woman called'shame' on me!The beggar to whom I
flung an alms, that I might purchase one blessing, threw it back in
disgust, and with a curse upon the coward!Each bell that tolled rung
out, 'Shame on the recreant caitiff!'The brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse
waters in their dash and roar, cried, 'Out upon the dastard!'The
faithful nine are still pursuing me; they cry with feeble voice, 'Strike
but one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!'"While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but
with a terrified glance towards the thicket, through which one or two
attendants were stealing, with the purpose of surprising him.But the
instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he
waved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air
Eachin!"plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath.It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed
to pieces in such a fall.But the river was swelled, and the remains of
the unhappy youth were never seen.A varying tradition has assigned more
than one supplement to the history.It is said by one account, that the
young captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of
Campsie; and that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch,
he met with Father Clement, who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees.He converted, it is
said, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his
cell, sharing his devotion and privations, till death removed them in
succession.Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the
daione shie, or fairy folk, and that he continues to wander through wood
and wild, armed like an ancient Highlander, but carrying his sword in
his left hand.Sometimes he
seems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage,
always flies.These legends are founded on two peculiar points in his
story--his evincing timidity and his committing suicide--both of them
circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in
his own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of
Campsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever, in consequence
of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly
the catastrophe of her late playmate.The affection of the glee maiden
rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it
should not be his fault if she ever touched lute again, save for her own
amusement.It was some time ere Simon ventured to tell his daughter of Henry's late
exploits, and his severe wounds; and he took care to make the most of
the encouraging circumstance, that her faithful lover had refused both
honour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the
Douglas.Catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of
bloody Palm Sunday on the North Inch.But apparently she had reflected
that men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas
of their own age, and that a headlong and exuberant courage, like that
of Henry Smith, was, in the iron days in which they lived, preferable to
the deficiency which had led to Conachar's catastrophe.If she had
any doubts on the subject, they were removed in due time by Henry's
protestations, so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own
cause."I should blush to say, Catharine, that I am even sick of the thoughts
of doing battle.Yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a
tiger.I am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword, never to be
drawn more unless against the enemies of Scotland.""And should Scotland call for it," said Catharine, "I will buckle it
round you.""And, Catharine," said the joyful glover, "we will pay largely for soul
masses for those who have fallen by Henry's sword; and that will not
only cure spiritual flaws, but make us friends with the church again.""For that purpose, father," said Catharine, "the hoards of the wretched
Dwining may be applied.He bequeathed them to me; but I think you would
not mix his base blood money with your honest gains?""I would bring the plague into my house as soon," said the resolute
glover.The treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly
among the four monasteries; nor was there ever after a breath of
suspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old Simon or his daughter.Henry and Catharine were married within four months after the battle
of the North Inch, and never did the corporations of the glovers and
hammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the
boldest burgess and brightest maiden in Perth.Ten months after, a
gallant infant filled the well spread cradle, and was rocked by Louise
to the tune of--

     Bold and true,
     In bonnet blue.The names of the boy's sponsors are recorded, as "Ane Hie and Michty
Lord, Archibald Erl of Douglas, ane Honorabil and gude Knicht, Schir
Patrick Charteris of Kinfauns, and ane Gracious Princess, Marjory
Dowaire of his Serene Highness David, umquhile Duke of Rothsay."Under such patronage a family rises fast; and several of the most
respected houses in Scotland, but especially in Perthshire, and many
individuals distinguished both in arts and arms, record with pride their
descent from the Gow Chrom and the Fair Maid of Perth."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he's got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"
said Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,
Sherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked
you and called you 'Uncle Billy.'And I told him that was the best
recommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that
go through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You'll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don't want the Major right away, do
you?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just
a little bit."I've got a sneaking notion that Grant's going to do
something."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be
careful he doesn't talk you to death--he's said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have
ridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy
and errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is
the last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of
Five Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front
of the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was
raging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,
and--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter
the smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the
President.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I
should choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer
lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had
built.There were but a few of us in his
party, and we stepped into Admiral Porter's twelve-oared barge and were
rowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We
landed within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half
to General Weitzel's headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the
Confederacy.I shall remember him always as
I saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk
hat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he
walked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows
filled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the
President was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried
hosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his
coat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President's
feet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a
conqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the
crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the
Potomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--

          "Duncan is in his grave;
        After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
        Can touch him further."WILLARD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW

The train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight
of the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely
pressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look
after them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the
girl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle's house, my dear?"she asked,
glancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she
had worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle's house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,
alert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you
could, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,
you promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain't de kerridge
you wants.Dat's it, lady, you'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,
kerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she
stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing
patiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming
and going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and
territories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching
hearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the
throng hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful
homes they had left?Destroyed,
like her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and
mothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young
men and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear
ones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands
and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood
beyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then
sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They
were splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,
Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to
desist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don't
compare to St.Louis, except we haven't got the White House and the
Capitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we
don't have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine
Houses like that.We don't
have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence
streets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren't pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You've had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I'd put up with a good deal more than
this for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun'll only come out and dry things up and
let us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to
see the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you're just trying to keep up my spirits.You've been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There's nothing for you to
be cast down about.""Suppose I can't make your Black
Republican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear
unconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the
near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread
the umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,
flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a
series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They
climbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by
a smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain't to home now."Didn't he get my telegram day before
yesterday?"He's done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by
the young lady's looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo' you,
miss?""I'm his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler's face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you
often--yas'm.De General'll be to home dis a'ternoon, suah.'Twill do
him good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right
in, Cap'n, and make yo'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at
Calve't House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall
sofa."Yas'm," said Lizbeth, "jes' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a
walnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs
placed about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and
started out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I'm going to the White House in a little
while.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming
calmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don't go doin' any such fool
trick as that.Your Uncle Dan'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing'll be fixed all right, and no
mistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used
for three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she
spoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can't get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn't any one a right to see the President?You
mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these
pretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the
Yankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,
remind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee's surrender and the
approaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of
the President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and
reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,
be he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a
distance may come at a President's true character and worth.The Captain
had seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the
pleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know
what to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the
South; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and
he had seen enough in the girl's demeanor to fear that she was going to
demand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to
bend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,
Jinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then
she took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won't do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won't get you
halfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations
of Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and
splashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,
and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of
Lee's surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not
repress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you'll find the President a good
deal of a man.Now if you're allowed to see him, don't get him mad,
Jinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a
woman."And just then they came in sight of the house of
the Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they
turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a
black coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately
gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some
money to the driver."I reckon he needn't wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook
her head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the
anteroom of the President's office on the second floor.There were
many people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who
stared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all
sorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and
keen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier
sitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their
seats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the
doorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you'll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and
looking at Virginia."It's slow work waiting your turn,
there's so many governors and generals and senators, although the
session's over.And added, with an inspiration,
"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman's instinct, that these words had had
their effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You're sure, miss, it's life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to
give precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a
minute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I'll see what I
can do for you.In a little while the heavy door
opened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of
what he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped
into the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was
a big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the
President of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave
her.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,
the unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more
ridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he

PART I

"Well!"said the editor of the "Mountain Clarion," looking up
impatiently from his copy.The intruder in his sanctum was his foreman.He was also acting as
pressman, as might be seen from his shirt-sleeves spattered with ink,
rolled up over the arm that had just been working "the Archimedian lever
that moves the world," which was the editor's favorite allusion to the
hand-press that strict economy obliged the "Clarion" to use.His braces,
slipped from his shoulders during his work, were looped negligently
on either side, their functions being replaced by one hand, which
occasionally hitched up his trousers to a securer position.A pair
of down-at-heel slippers--dear to the country printer--completed his
negligee.But the editor knew that the ink-spattered arm was sinewy and ready,
that a stout and loyal heart beat under the soiled shirt, and that the
slipshod slippers did not prevent its owner's foot from being "put down"
very firmly on occasion.He accordingly met the shrewd, good-humored
blue eyes of his faithful henchman with an interrogating smile."I won't keep you long," said the foreman, glancing at the editor's copy
with his habitual half humorous toleration of that work, it being his
general conviction that news and advertisements were the only valuable
features of a newspaper; "I only wanted to talk to you a minute about
makin' suthin more o' this yer accident to Colonel Starbottle.""Well, we've a full report of it in, haven't we?"about the frequency of
these accidents, and called attention to the danger of riding those half
broken Spanish mustangs.""Yes, ye did that," said the foreman tolerantly; "but ye see, thar's
some folks around here that allow it warn't no accident.There's a heap
of them believe that no runaway hoss ever mauled the colonel ez HE got
mauled.""But I heard it from the colonel's own lips," said the editor, "and HE
surely ought to know.""He mout know and he moutn't, and if he DID know, he wouldn't tell,"
said the foreman musingly, rubbing his chin with the cleaner side of his
arm."Ye didn't see him when he was picked up, did ye?""Jake Parmlee, ez picked him up outer the ditch, says that he was half
choked, and his black silk neck-handkercher was pulled tight around his
throat.There was a mark on his nose ez ef some one had tried to gouge
out his eye, and his left ear was chawed ez ef he'd bin down in a
reg'lar rough-and-tumble clinch.""He told me his horse bolted, buck-jumped, threw him, and he lost
consciousness," said the editor positively."He had no reason for lying,
and a man like Starbottle, who carries a Derringer and is a dead shot,
would have left his mark on somebody if he'd been attacked.""That's what the boys say is just the reason why he lied.He was TOOK
SUDDENT, don't ye see,--he'd no show--and don't like to confess it.A man like HIM ain't goin' to advertise that he kin be tackled and left
senseless and no one else got hurt by it!The editor was momentarily staggered at this large truth."Who would attack Colonel Starbottle
in that fashion?He might have been shot on sight by some political
enemy with whom he had quarreled--but not BEATEN.""S'pose it warn't no political enemy?""That's jest for the press to find out and expose," returned the
foreman, with a significant glance at the editor's desk."I reckon
that's whar the 'Clarion' ought to come in.""In a matter of this kind," said the editor promptly, "the paper has no
business to interfere with a man's statement.The colonel has a perfect
right to his own secret--if there is one, which I very much doubt.But,"
he added, in laughing recognition of the half reproachful, half humorous
discontent on the foreman's face, "what dreadful theory have YOU and the
boys got about it--and what do YOU expect to expose?""Well," said the foreman very seriously, "it's jest this: You see, the
colonel is mighty sweet on that Spanish woman Ramierez up on the hill
yonder.It was her mustang he was ridin' when the row happened near her
house."said the editor, with disconcerting placidity."Well,"--hesitated the foreman, "you see, they're a bad lot, those
Greasers, especially the Ramierez, her husband."The editor knew that the foreman was only echoing the provincial
prejudice against this race, which he himself had always combated.Ramierez kept a fonda or hostelry on a small estate,--the last of many
leagues formerly owned by the Spanish grantee, his landlord,--and had a
wife of some small coquetries and redundant charms.Gambling took place
at the fonda, and it was said the common prejudice against the Mexican
did not, however, prevent the American from trying to win his money."Then you think Ramierez was jealous of the colonel?But in that case he
would have knifed him,--Spanish fashion,--and not without a struggle.""There's more ways they have o' killin' a man than that; he might hev
been dragged off his horse by a lasso and choked," said the foreman
darkly.The editor had heard of this vaquero method of putting an enemy hors
de combat; but it was a clumsy performance for the public road, and the
brutality of its manner would have justified the colonel in exposing it.The foreman saw the incredulity expressed in his face, and said somewhat
aggressively, "Of course I know ye don't take no stock in what's said
agin the Greasers, and that's what the boys know, and what they said,
and that's the reason why I thought I oughter tell ye, so that ye
mightn't seem to be always favorin' 'em."The editor's face darkened slightly, but he kept his temper and his
good humor."So that to prove that the 'Clarion' is unbiased where the
Mexicans are concerned, I ought to make it their only accuser, and cast
a doubt on the American's veracity?""I don't mean that," said the foreman, reddening."Only I thought ye
might--as ye understand these folks' ways--ye might be able to get at
them easy, and mebbe make some copy outer the blamed thing.It would
just make a stir here, and be a big boom for the 'Clarion.'""I've no doubt it would," said the editor dryly."However, I'll make
some inquiries; but you might as well let 'the boys' know that the
'Clarion' will not publish the colonel's secret without his permission.Meanwhile," he continued, smiling, "if you are very anxious to add
the functions of a reporter to your other duties and bring me any
discoveries you may make, I'll--look over your copy."He good humoredly nodded, and took up his pen again,--a hint at which
the embarrassed foreman, under cover of hitching up his trousers,
awkwardly and reluctantly withdrew.It was with some natural youthful curiosity, but no lack of loyalty to
Colonel Starbottle, that the editor that evening sought this "war-horse
of the Democracy," as he was familiarly known, in his invalid chamber at
the Palmetto Hotel.He found the hero with a bandaged ear and--perhaps
it was fancy suggested by the story of the choking--cheeks more than
usually suffused and apoplectic.Nevertheless, he was seated by the
table with a mint julep before him, and welcomed the editor by instantly
ordering another.The editor was glad to find him so much better."Gad, sir, no bones broken, but a good deal of 'possum scratching about
the head for such a little throw like that.I must have slid a yard or
two on my left ear before I brought up.""You were unconscious from the fall, I believe.""Only for an instant, sir--a single instant!I recovered myself with the
assistance of a No'the'n gentleman--a Mr."Then you think your injuries were entirely due to your fall?"The colonel paused with the mint julep halfway to his lips, and set it
down."You say you were unconscious," returned the editor lightly, "and some
of your friends think the injuries inconsistent with what you believe to
be the cause.They are concerned lest you were unknowingly the victim of
some foul play."Do you take me for a chuckle-headed niggah, that I
don't know when I'm thrown from a buck-jumping mustang?or do they think
I'm a Chinaman to be hustled and beaten by a gang of bullies?Do
they know, sir, that the account I have given I am responsible for,
sir?--personally responsible?"There was no doubt to the editor that the colonel was perfectly serious,
and that the indignation arose from no guilty consciousness of a
secret.A man as peppery as the colonel would have been equally alert in
defense."They feared that you might have been ill used by some evilly
disposed person during your unconsciousness," explained the editor
diplomatically; "but as you say THAT was only for a moment, and that you
were aware of everything that happened"--He paused.As plain as I see this julep before me.I
had just left the Ramierez rancho.The senora,--a devilish pretty
woman, sir,--after a little playful badinage, had offered to lend me
her daughter's mustang if I could ride it home."I'm an older man than you, sir, but a
challenge from a d----d fascinating creature, I trust, sir, I am not yet
old enough to decline.Gad, sir, I mounted the brute.I've ridden Morgan
stock and Blue Grass thoroughbreds bareback, sir, but I've never thrown
my leg over such a blanked Chinese cracker before.After he bolted I
held my own fairly, but he buck-jumped before I could lock my spurs
under him, and the second jump landed me!""How far from the Ramierez fonda were you when you were thrown?""A matter of four or five hundred yards, sir.""Then your accident might have been seen from the fonda?"For in that case, I may say, without vanity,
that--er--the--er senora would have come to my assistance."The old-fashioned shirt-frill which the colonel habitually wore grew
erectile with a swelling indignation, possibly half assumed to conceal a
certain conscious satisfaction beneath.Grey," he said, with pained
severity, "as a personal friend of mine, and a representative of the
press,--a power which I respect,--I overlook a disparaging reflection
upon a lady, which I can only attribute to the levity of youth and
thoughtlessness.At the same time, sir," he added, with illogical
sequence, "if Ramierez felt aggrieved at my attentions, he knew where
I could be found, sir, and that it was not my habit to decline
giving gentlemen--of any nationality--satisfaction--sir!--personal
satisfaction."He paused, and then added, with a singular blending of anxiety and a
certain natural dignity, "I trust, sir, that nothing of this--er--kind
will appear in your paper.""It was to keep it out by learning the truth from you, my dear colonel,"
said the editor lightly, "that I called to-day.Why, it was even
suggested," he added, with a laugh, "that you were half strangled by a
lasso."To his surprise the colonel did not join in the laugh, but brought his
hand to his loose cravat with an uneasy gesture and a somewhat disturbed
face."I admit, sir," he said, with a forced smile, "that I experienced
a certain sensation of choking, and I may have mentioned it to Mr.Parmlee; but it was due, I believe, sir, to my cravat, which I always
wear loosely, as you perceive, becoming twisted in my fall, and in
rolling over."He extended his fat white hand to the editor, who shook it cordially,
and then withdrew.Nevertheless, although perfectly satisfied with his
mission, and firmly resolved to prevent any further discussion on the
subject, Mr.What were the
relations of the colonel with the Ramierez family?From what he himself
had said, the theory of the foreman as to the motives of the attack
might have been possible, and the assault itself committed while the
colonel was unconscious.Grey, however, kept this to himself, briefly told his foreman that
he found no reason to add to the account already in type, and dismissed
the subject from his mind.One morning a week afterward, the foreman entered the sanctum
cautiously, and, closing the door of the composing-room behind him,
stood for a moment before the editor with a singular combination of
irresolution, shamefacedness, and humorous discomfiture in his face.Answering the editor's look of inquiry, he began slowly, "Mebbe ye
remember when we was talkin' last week o' Colonel Starbottle's accident,
I sorter allowed that he knew all the time WHY he was attacked that way,
only he wouldn't tell.""Yes, I remember you were incredulous," said the editor, smiling."Well, I have been through the mill myself!"He unbuttoned his shirt collar, pointed to his neck, which showed a
slight abrasion and a small livid mark of strangulation at the throat,
and added, with a grim smile, "And I've got about as much proof as I
want."The editor put down his pen and stared at him.When you bedeviled me
about gettin' that news, and allowed I might try my hand at reportin',
I was fool enough to take up the challenge.So once or twice, when I was
off duty here, I hung around the Ramierez shanty.Once I went in thar
when they were gamblin'; thar war one or two Americans thar that war
winnin' as far as I could see, and was pretty full o' that aguardiente
that they sell thar--that kills at forty rods.You see, I had a kind o'
suspicion that ef thar was any foul play goin' on it might be worked
on these fellers ARTER they were drunk, and war goin' home with thar
winnin's.""So you gave up your theory of the colonel being attacked from
jealousy?"I only reckoned that ef thar was a gang
of roughs kept thar on the premises they might be used for that purpose,
and I only wanted to ketch em at thar work.So I jest meandered into the
road when they war about comin' out, and kept my eye skinned for what
might happen.Thar was a kind o' corral about a hundred yards down the
road, half adobe wall, and a stockade o' palm's on top of it, about six
feet high.Some of the palm's were off, and I peeped through, but thar
warn't nobody thar.I stood thar, alongside the bank, leanin' my back
agin one o' them openin's, and jest watched and waited."All of a suddent I felt myself grabbed by my coat collar behind, and my
neck-handkercher and collar drawn tight around my throat till I couldn't
breathe.The more I twisted round, the tighter the clinch seemed to get.I couldn't holler nor speak, but thar I stood with my mouth open, pinned
back agin that cursed stockade, and my arms and legs movin' up and down,
like one o' them dancin' jacks!Grey--I reckon I
looked like a darned fool--but I don't wanter feel ag'in as I did jest
then.The clinch o' my throat got tighter; everything got black about
me; I was jest goin' off and kalkilatin' it was about time for you to
advertise for another foreman, when suthin broke--fetched away!"It was my collar button, and I dropped like a shot.It was a minute
before I could get my breath ag'in, and when I did and managed to climb
that darned stockade, and drop on the other side, thar warn't a soul to
be seen!A few hosses that stampeded in my gettin' over the fence war
all that was there!I was mighty shook up, you bet!--and to make the
hull thing perfectly ridic'lous, when I got back to the road, after all
I'd got through, darn my skin, ef thar warn't that pesky lot o' drunken
men staggerin' along, jinglin' the scads they had won, and enjoyin'
themselves, and nobody a-followin' 'em!I jined 'em jest for kempany's
sake, till we got back to town, but nothin' happened.""But, my dear Richards," said the editor warmly, "this is no longer a
matter of mere reporting, but of business for the police.You must see
the deputy sheriff at once, and bring your complaint--or shall I?"I've told this to nobody
but you--nor am I goin' to--sabe?It's an affair of my own--and I reckon
I kin take care of it without goin' to the Revised Statutes of the State
of California, or callin' out the sheriff's posse."His humorous blue eyes just then had certain steely points in them like
glittering facets as he turned them away, which the editor had
seen before on momentous occasions, and he was speaking slowly and
composedly, which the editor also knew boded no good to an adversary."Don't be a fool, Richards," he said quietly."Don't take as a personal
affront what was a common, vulgar crime.You would undoubtedly have been
robbed by that rascal had not the others come along.""I might hev bin robbed a dozen times afore
THEY came along--ef that was the little game.Grey,--it warn't
no robbery.""Had you been paying court to the Senora Ramierez, like Colonel
Starbottle?""Not much," returned Richards scornfully; "she ain't my style.But"--he
hesitated, and then added, "thar was a mighty purty gal thar--and her
darter, I reckon--a reg'lar pink fairy!She kem in only a minute, and
they sorter hustled her out ag'in--for darn my skin ef she didn't look
as much out o' place in that smoky old garlic-smellin' room as an angel
at a bull-fight.And what got me--she was ez white ez you or me, with
blue eyes, and a lot o' dark reddish hair in a long braid down her back.Why, only for her purty sing-song voice and her 'Gracias, senor,'
you'd hev reckoned she was a Blue Grass girl jest fresh from across the
plains."A little amused at his foreman's enthusiasm, Mr.Grey gave an
ostentatious whistle and said, "Come, now, Richards, look here!"Only a little girl--a mere child, Mr.Grey--not more'n fourteen if a
day," responded Richards, in embarrassed depreciation."Yes, but those people marry at twelve," said the editor, with a
laugh.Your appreciation may have been noticed by some other
admirer."He half regretted this speech the next moment in the quick flush--the
male instinct of rivalry--that brought back the glitter of Richards's
eyes."I reckon I kin take care of that, sir," he said slowly, "and I
kalkilate that the next time I meet that chap--whoever he may be--he
won't see so much of my back as he did."The editor knew there was little doubt of this, and for an instant
believed it his duty to put the matter in the hands of the police.Richards was too good and brave a man to be risked in a bar-room fight.But reflecting that this might precipitate the scandal he wished to
avoid, he concluded to make some personal investigation.A stronger
curiosity than he had felt before was possessing him.It was singular,
too, that Richards's description of the girl was that of a different and
superior type--the hidalgo, or fair-skinned Spanish settler.If this
was true, what was she doing there--and what were her relations to the
Ramierez?PART II

The next afternoon he went to the fonda.Situated on the outskirts of
the town which had long outgrown it, it still bore traces of its former
importance as a hacienda, or smaller farm, of one of the old Spanish
landholders.The patio, or central courtyard, still existed as a
stable-yard for carts, and even one or two horses were tethered to the
railings of the inner corridor, which now served as an open veranda to
the fonda or inn.The opposite wing was utilized as a tienda, or
general shop,--a magazine for such goods as were used by the Mexican
inhabitants,--and belonged also to Ramierez.Ramierez himself--round-whiskered and Sancho Panza-like in
build--welcomed the editor with fat, perfunctory urbanity.The fonda and
all it contained was at his disposicion.The senora coquettishly bewailed, in rising and falling inflections, his
long absence, his infidelity and general perfidiousness.Truly he was
growing great in writing of the affairs of his nation--he could no
longer see his humble friends!Yet not long ago--truly that very
week--there was the head impresor of Don Pancho's imprenta himself who
had been there!A great man, of a certainty, and they must take what they could get!They were only poor innkeepers; when the governor came not they must
welcome the alcalde.To which the editor--otherwise Don Pancho--replied
with equal effusion.He had indeed recommended the fonda to his
impresor, who was but a courier before him.The
impresor had been ravished at the sight of a beautiful girl--a mere
muchacha--yet of a beauty that deprived the senses--this angel--clearly
the daughter of his friend!Here was the old miracle of the orange in
full fruition and the lovely fragrant blossom all on the same tree--at
the fonda."Yes, it was but a thing of yesterday," said the senora, obviously
pleased."The muchacha--for she was but that--had just returned from the
convent at San Jose, where she had been for four years.The fonda was no place for the child, who should know only the
litany of the Virgin--and they had kept her there.And now--that she
was home again--she cared only for the horse.There might be a festival--all the same to
her, it made nothing if she had the horse to ride!Even now she was with
one in the fields.Would Don Pancho attend and see Cota and her horse?"The editor smilingly assented, and accompanied his hostess along the
corridor to a few steps which brought them to the level of the open
meadows of the old farm inclosure.A slight white figure on horseback
was careering in the distance.At a signal from Senora Ramierez it
wheeled and came down rapidly towards them.But when within a hundred
yards the horse was suddenly pulled up vaquero fashion, and the little
figure leaped off and advanced toward them on foot, leading the horse.Grey saw that she had been riding bareback, and
from her discreet halt at that distance he half suspected ASTRIDE!His
effusive compliments to the mother on this exhibition of skill were
sincere, for he was struck by the girl's fearlessness.But when
both horse and rider at last stood before him, he was speechless and
embarrassed.For Richards had not exaggerated the girl's charms.She was indeed
dangerously pretty, from her tawny little head to her small feet,
and her figure, although comparatively diminutive, was perfectly
proportioned.Gray eyed and blonde as she was in color, her racial
peculiarities were distinct, and only the good-humored and enthusiastic
Richards could have likened her to an American girl.But he was the more astonished in noticing that her mustang was as
distinct and peculiar as herself--a mongrel mare of the extraordinary
type known as a "pinto," or "calico" horse, mottled in lavender and
pink, Arabian in proportions, and half broken!Her greenish gray eyes,
in which too much of the white was visible, had, he fancied, a singular
similarity of expression to Cota's own!Utterly confounded, and staring at the girl in her white, many flounced
frock, bare head, and tawny braids, as she stood beside this incarnation
of equine barbarism, Grey could remember nothing like it outside of a
circus.He stammered a few words of admiration of the mare.Miss Cota threw out
her two arms with a graceful gesture and a profound curtsey, and said--

"A la disposicion de le Usted, senor."Grey was quick to understand the malicious mischief which underlay this
formal curtsey and danced in the girl's eyes, and even fancied it shared
by the animal itself.But he was a singularly good rider of untrained
stock, and rather proud of his prowess."I accept that I may have the honor of laying the senorita's gift again
at her little feet."But here the burly Ramierez intervened.May the
devil fly away with all this nonsense!I will have no more of it," he
said impatiently to the girl."Have a care, Don Pancho," he turned to
the editor; "it is a trick!""One I think I know," said Grey sapiently.The girl looked at him
curiously as he managed to edge between her and the mustang, under the
pretense of stroking its glossy neck."I shall keep MY OWN spurs,"
he said to her in a lower voice, pointing to the sharp, small-roweled
American spurs he wore, instead of the large, blunt, five-pointed star
of the Mexican pattern.The girl evidently did not understand him then--though she did a moment
later!For without attempting to catch hold of the mustang's mane, Grey
in a single leap threw himself across its back.The animal, utterly
unprepared, was at first stupefied.But by this time her rider had his
seat.He felt her sensitive spine arch like a cat's beneath him as she
sprang rocket-wise into the air.Instead of clinging tightly to her flanks
with the inner side of his calves, after the old vaquero fashion to
which she was accustomed, he dropped his spurred heels into her sides
and allowed his body to rise with her spring, and the cruel spur to cut
its track upward from her belly almost to her back.She dropped like a shot, he dexterously withdrawing his spurs, and
regaining his seat, jarred but not discomfited.Again she essayed a
leap; the spurs again marked its height in a scarifying track along her
smooth barrel.She tried a third leap, but this time dropped halfway as
she felt the steel scraping her side, and then stood still, trembling.There was a sound of applause from the innkeeper and his wife, assisted
by a lounging vaquero in the corridor.Ashamed of his victory, Grey
turned apologetically to Cota.To his surprise she glanced indifferently
at the trickling sides of her favorite, and only regarded him curiously."Ah," she said, drawing in her breath, "you are strong--and you
comprehend!""It was only a trick for a trick, senorita," he replied, reddening;
"let me look after those scratches in the stable," he added, as she was
turning away, leading the agitated and excited animal toward a shed in
the rear.He would have taken the riata which she was still holding, but she
motioned him to precede her.He did so by a few feet, but he had
scarcely reached the stable door before she suddenly caught him roughly
by the shoulders, and, shoving him into the entrance, slammed the door
upon him.Amazed and a little indignant, he turned in time to hear a slight sound
of scuffling outside, and to see Cota re-enter with a flushed face."Pardon, senor," she said quickly, "but I feared she might have kicked
you.Rest tranquil, however, for the servant he has taken her away."She pointed to a slouching peon with a malevolent face, who was angrily
driving the mustang toward the corral.I almost threw you, too;
but," she added, with a dazzling smile, "you must not punish me as you
have her!For you are very strong--and you comprehend."But Grey did not comprehend, and with a few hurried apologies he managed
to escape his fair but uncanny tormentor.Besides, this unlooked-for
incident had driven from his mind the more important object of his
visit,--the discovery of the assailants of Richards and Colonel
Starbottle.His inquiries of the Ramierez produced no result.Senor Ramierez was not
aware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda,
and except from some drunken American or Irish revelers he had been free
of disturbance.the peon--an old vaquero--was not an angel, truly, but he was
dangerous only to the bull and the wild horses--and he was afraid even
of Cota!Grey was fain to ride home empty of information.He was still more concerned a week later, on returning unexpectedly
one afternoon to his sanctum, to hear a musical, childish voice in the
composing-room.She was there, as Richards explained, on his invitation, to
view the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would
not be likely to "disturb Mr.But the beaming face of
Richards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed
the sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion, and the unwonted
splendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for
the occasion.Grey was worried and perplexed, believing the girl a malicious flirt.Yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish
curiosity, as she watched Richards swing the lever of the press,
or stood by his side as he marshaled the type into files on his
"composing-stick."He had even printed a card with her name, "Senorita
Cota Ramierez," the type of which had been set up, to the accompaniment
of ripples of musical laughter, by her little brown fingers.The editor might have become quite sentimental and poetical had he not
noticed that the gray eyes which often rested tentatively and meaningly
on himself, even while apparently listening to Richards, were more than
ever like the eyes of the mustang on whose scarred flanks her glance had
wandered so coldly.He withdrew presently so as not to interrupt his foreman's innocent
tete-a-tete, but it was not very long after that Cota passed him on the
highroad with the pinto horse in a gallop, and blew him an audacious
kiss from the tips of her fingers.For several days afterwards Richards's manner was tinged with a certain
reserve on the subject of Cota which the editor attributed to the
delicacy of a serious affection, but he was surprised also to find that
his foreman's eagerness to discuss his unknown assailant had somewhat
abated.Further discussion regarding it naturally dropped, and the
editor was beginning to lose his curiosity when it was suddenly awakened
by a chance incident.An intimate friend and old companion of his--one Enriquez Saltillo--had
diverged from a mountain trip especially to call upon him.Enriquez
was a scion of one of the oldest Spanish-California families, and in
addition to his friendship for the editor it pleased him also to affect
an intense admiration of American ways and habits, and even to combine
the current California slang with his native precision of speech--and a
certain ironical levity still more his own.It seemed, therefore, quite natural to Mr.Grey to find him seated with
his feet on the editorial desk, his hat cocked on the back of his head,
reading the "Clarion" exchanges.But he was up in a moment, and had
embraced Grey with characteristic effusion."I find myself, my leetle brother, but an hour ago two leagues from this
spot!It is the home of Don Pancho--my friend!I shall find him composing the magnificent editorial leader, collecting
the subscription of the big pumpkin and the great gooseberry, or gouging
out the eye of the rival editor, at which I shall assist!'I hesitate no
longer; I fly on the instant, and I am here."Saltillo knew the Spanish population thoroughly--his
own superior race and their Mexican and Indian allies.If any one could
solve the mystery of the Ramierez fonda, and discover Richards's unknown
assailant, it was HE!But Grey contented himself, at first, with a
few brief inquiries concerning the beautiful Cota and her anonymous
association with the Ramierez."Of your suspicions, my leetle brother, you are right--on the half!That
leetle angel of a Cota is, without doubt, the daughter of the adorable
Senora Ramierez, but not of the admirable senor--her husband.We are a simple, patriarchal race; thees Ramierez, he was the
Mexican tenant of the old Spanish landlord--such as my father--and we
are ever the fathers of the poor, and sometimes of their children.It
is possible, therefore, that the exquisite Cota resemble the Spanish
landlord.I remember," he went on, suddenly
striking his forehead with a dramatic gesture, "the old owner of thees
ranch was my cousin Tiburcio.Of a consequence, my friend, thees angel
is my second cousin!I shall
embrace my long-lost relation.I shall introduce my best friend, Don
Pancho, who lofe her.I shall say, 'Bless you, my children,' and it is
feenish!He started up and clapped on his hat, but Grey caught him by the arm."For Heaven's sake, Enriquez, be serious for once," he said, forcing him
back into the chair.The foreman in the other
room is an enthusiastic admirer of the girl.In fact, it is on his
account that I am making these inquiries.""Ah, the gentleman of the pantuflos, whose trousers will not remain!Truly he has the ambition excessif to arrive
from the bed to go to the work without the dress or the wash.But," in
recognition of Grey's half serious impatience, "remain tranquil.The friend of my friend is ever the
same as my friend!He is truly not seducing to the eye, but without
doubt he will arrive a governor or a senator in good time.I shall gif
to him my second cousin.He attempted to rise, but was held down and vigorously shaken by Grey."I've half a mind to let you do it, and get chucked through the window
for your pains," said the editor, with a half laugh.This
is a more serious matter than you suppose."And Grey briefly recounted the incident of the mysterious attacks on
Starbottle and Richards.As he proceeded he noticed, however, that
the ironical light died out of Enriquez's eyes, and a singular
thoughtfulness, yet unlike his usual precise gravity, came over his
face.He twirled the ends of his penciled mustache--an unfailing sign of
Enriquez's emotion."The same accident that arrive to two men that shall be as opposite as
the gallant Starbottle and the excellent Richards shall not prove that
it come from Ramierez, though they both were at the fonda," he said
gravely."The cause of it have not come to-day, nor yesterday, nor
last week.The cause of it have arrive before there was any gallant
Starbottle or excellent Richards; before there was any American in
California--before you and I, my leetle brother, have lif!The cause
happen first--TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!"The editor's start of impatient incredulity was checked by the
unmistakable sincerity of Enriquez's face."It is so," he went on
gravely; "it is an old story--it is a long story.I shall make him
short--and new."He stopped and lit a cigarette without changing his odd expression."It was when the padres first have the mission, and take the heathen and
convert him--and save his soul.It was their business, you comprehend,
my Pancho?The more heathen they convert, the more soul they save, the
better business for their mission shop.But the heathen do not always
wish to be 'convert;' the heathen fly, the heathen skidaddle, the
heathen will not remain, or will backslide.So the
holy fathers make a little game.You do not of a possibility comprehend
how the holy fathers make a convert, my leetle brother?"They take from the presidio five or six
dragons--you comprehend--the cavalry soldiers, and they pursue the
heathen from his little hut.When they cannot surround him and he fly,
they catch him with the lasso, like the wild hoss.The lasso catch
him around the neck; he is obliged to remain.Sometime he is dead, but the soul is save!I
see you wrinkle the brow--you flash the eye; you like it not?Believe
me, I like it not, neither, but it is so!"He shrugged his shoulders, threw away his half smoked cigarette, and
went on."One time a padre who have the zeal excessif for the saving of soul,
when he find the heathen, who is a young girl, have escape the soldiers,
he of himself have seize the lasso and flung it!He is lucky; he catch
her--but look you!She not only fly, but of
a surety she drag the good padre with her!He cannot loose himself, for
his riata is fast to the saddle; the dragons cannot help, for he is drag
so fast.On the instant she have gone--and so have the padre.It is not a young girl he have lasso, but the devil!You comprehend--it
is a punishment--a retribution--he is feenish!"For every year he must come back a spirit--on a spirit hoss--and swing
the lasso, and make as if to catch the heathen.He is condemn ever to
play his little game; now there is no heathen more to convert, he catch
what he can.My grandfather have once seen him--it is night and a storm,
and he pass by like a flash!My grandfather like it not--he is much
dissatisfied!My uncle have seen him, too, but he make the sign of
the cross, and the lasso have fall to the side, and my uncle have much
gratification.A vaquero of my father and a peon of my cousin have both
been picked up, lassoed, and dragged dead."Many peoples have died of him in the strangling.Sometime he is seen,
sometime it is the woman only that one sees--sometime it is but the
hoss.Of a truth, my friend, the
gallant Starbottle and the ambitious Richards have just escaped!"There was not the slightest
suggestion of mischief or irony in his tone or manner; nothing, indeed,
but a sincerity and anxiety usually rare with his temperament.It struck
him also that his speech had but little of the odd California slang
which was always a part of his imitative levity."Do you mean to say that this superstition is well known?"It is not more difficult to comprehend than your story."With it he seemed to have put on his old
levity."Come, behold, it is a long time between drinks!Let us to the
hotel and the barkeep, who shall give up the smash of brandy and the
julep of mints before the lasso of Friar Pedro shall prevent us the
swallow!Grey returned to the "Clarion" office in a much more satisfied
condition of mind.Whatever faith he held in Enriquez's sincerity, for
the first time since the attack on Colonel Starbottle he believed he had
found a really legitimate journalistic opportunity in the incident.The
legend and its singular coincidence with the outrages would make capital
"copy."No names would be mentioned, yet even if Colonel Starbottle recognized
his own adventure, he could not possibly object to this interpretation
of it.The editor had found that few people objected to be the hero of
a ghost story, or the favored witness of a spiritual manifestation.Nor
could Richards find fault with this view of his own experience, hitherto
kept a secret, so long as it did not refer to his relations with the
fair Cota.Summoning him at once to his sanctum, he briefly repeated the
story he had just heard, and his purpose of using it.To his surprise,
Richards's face assumed a seriousness and anxiety equal to Enriquez's
own.Grey," he said awkwardly, "and I ain't sayin'
it ain't mighty good newspaper stuff, but it won't do NOW, for the whole
mystery's up and the assailant found.""I didn't reckon ye were so keen on it," said Richards embarrassedly,
"and--and--it wasn't my own secret altogether.""Go on," said the editor impatiently."Well," said Richards slowly and doggedly, "ye see there was a fool that
was sweet on Cota, and he allowed himself to be bedeviled by her to ride
her cursed pink and yaller mustang.Naturally the beast bolted at once,
but he managed to hang on by the mane for half a mile or so, when it
took to buck-jumpin'.The first 'buck' threw him clean into the road,
but didn't stun him, yet when he tried to rise, the first thing he
knowed he was grabbed from behind and half choked by somebody.He was
held so tight that he couldn't turn, but he managed to get out his
revolver and fire two shots under his arm.The grip held on for a
minute, and then loosened, and the somethin' slumped down on top o' him,
but he managed to work himself around.And then--what do you think he
saw?--why, that thar hoss!with two bullet holes in his neck, lyin'
beside him, but still grippin' his coat collar and neck-handkercher in
his teeth!the rough that attacked Colonel Starbottle, the
villain that took me behind when I was leanin' agin that cursed fence,
was that same God-forsaken, hell-invented pinto hoss!"In a flash of recollection the editor remembered his own experience, and
the singular scuffle outside the stable door of the fonda.Undoubtedly
Cota had saved him from a similar attack."But why not tell this story with the other?"said the editor, returning
to his first idea."It won't do," said Richards, with dogged resolution."Yes," said Richards, with a darkening face."Again attacked, and by the
same hoss!Whether Cota was or was not knowin' its tricks,
she was actually furious at me for killin' it--and it's all over 'twixt
me and her.""Nonsense," said the editor impulsively; "she will forgive you!You
didn't know your assailant was a horse WHEN YOU FIRED.Look at the
attack on you in the road!"Richards shook his head with dogged hopelessness.I oughter guessed it was a hoss then--thar was nothin' else in
that corral.Cota's already gone away back to San Jose, and I reckon
the Ramierez has got scared of her and packed her off.So, on account
of its bein' HER hoss, and what happened betwixt me and her, you see my
mouth is shut.""And the columns of the 'Clarion' too," said the editor, with a sigh."I know it's hard, sir, but it's better so.I've reckoned mebbe she was
a little crazy, and since you've told me that Spanish yarn, it mout
be that she was sort o' playin' she was that priest, and trained that
mustang ez she did."After a pause, something of his old self came back into his blue eyes as
he sadly hitched up his braces and passed them over his broad shoulders."Yes, sir, I was a fool, for we've lost the only bit of real sensation
news that ever came in the way of the 'Clarion.'"A JACK AND JILL OF THE SIERRAS


It was four o'clock in the afternoon, and the hottest hour of the day
on that Sierran foothill.The western sun, streaming down the mile-long
<DW72> of close-set pine crests, had been caught on an outlying ledge of
glaring white quartz, covered with mining tools and debris, and
seemed to have been thrown into an incandescent rage.The air above it
shimmered and became visible.A white canvas tent on it was an object
not to be borne; the steel-tipped picks and shovels, intolerable to
touch and eyesight, and a tilted tin prospecting pan, falling over,
flashed out as another sun of insufferable effulgence.At such moments
the five members of the "Eureka Mining Company" prudently withdrew to
the nearest pine-tree, which cast a shadow so sharply defined on the
glistening sand that the impingement of a hand or finger beyond that
line cut like a knife.The men lay, or squatted, in this shadow,
feverishly puffing their pipes and waiting for the sun to slip beyond
the burning ledge.Yet so irritating was the dry air, fragrant with the
aroma of the heated pines, that occasionally one would start up and walk
about until he had brought on that profuse perspiration which gave
a momentary relief, and, as he believed, saved him from sunstroke.Suddenly a voice exclaimed querulously:--

"Derned if the blasted bucket ain't empty ag'in!Not a drop left, by
Jimminy!"A stare of helpless disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted
heads; then every man lay down again, as if trying to erase himself."I did," said a reflective voice coming from a partner lying comfortably
on his back, "and if anybody reckons I'm going to face Tophet ag'in
down that <DW72>, he's mistaken!"The speaker was thirsty--but he had
principles."We must throw round for it," said the foreman, taking the dice from his
pocket.He cast; the lowest number fell to Parkhurst, a florid, full-blooded
Texan."All right, gentlemen," he said, wiping his forehead, and lifting
the tin pail with a resigned air, "only EF anything comes to me on that
bare stretch o' stage road,--and I'm kinder seein' things spotty and
black now, remember you ain't anywhar NEARER the water than you were!I
ain't sayin' it for myself--but it mout be rough on YOU--and"--

"Give ME the pail," interrupted a tall young fellow, rising.Cries of "Good old Ned," and "Hunky boy!"greeted him as he took the
pail from the perspiring Parkhurst, who at once lay down again."You
mayn't be a professin' Christian, in good standin', Ned Bray," continued
Parkhurst from the ground, "but you're about as white as they make 'em,
and you're goin' to do a Heavenly Act!I repeat it, gents--a Heavenly
Act!"Without a reply Bray walked off with the pail, stopping only in the
underbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern, part of which he put
within the crown of his hat, and stuck the rest in its band around
the outer brim, making a parasol-like shade above his shoulders.Thus
equipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail
which began to descend towards the stage road.Here he was in the
full glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks, which
scorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash.The descent was
steep and necessarily slow from the slipperiness of the desiccated pine
needles that had fallen from above.Nor were his troubles over when,
a few rods further, he came upon the stage road, which here swept in
a sharp curve round the flank of the mountain, its red dust, ground by
heavy wagons and pack-trains into a fine powder, was nevertheless so
heavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the
foot, and he was obliged to literally wade through it.Yet there were
two hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach
that point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped
diagonally from it, to creep along the mountain side to the spring he
was seeking.When he reached the trail, he paused to take breath and wipe the
blinding beads of sweat from his eyes before he cautiously swung
himself over the bank into it.A single misstep here would have sent him
headlong to the tops of pine-trees a thousand feet below.Holding his
pail in one hand, with the other he steadied himself by clutching the
ferns and brambles at his side, and at last reached the spring--a niche
in the mountain side with a ledge scarcely four feet wide.He had merely
accomplished the ordinary gymnastic feat performed by the members of the
Eureka Company four or five times a day!He held his wrists to cool their throbbing pulses in the clear,
cold stream that gurgled into its rocky basin; he threw the water over
his head and shoulders; he swung his legs over the ledge and let the
overflow fall on his dusty shoes and ankles.Gentle and delicious rigors
came over him.He sat with half closed eyes looking across the dark
olive depths of the canyon between him and the opposite mountain.A hawk
was swinging lazily above it, apparently within a stone's throw of him;
he knew it was at least a mile away.Thirty feet above him ran the stage
road; he could hear quite distinctly the slow thud of hoofs, the dull
jar of harness, and the labored creaking of the Pioneer Coach as it
crawled up the long ascent, part of which he had just passed.He thought
of it,--a slow drifting cloud of dust and heat, as he had often seen
it, abandoned by even its passengers, who sought shelter in the wayside
pines as they toiled behind it to the summit,--and hugged himself in
the grateful shadows of the spring.It had passed out of hearing and
thought, he had turned to fill his pail, when he was startled by a
shower of dust and gravel from the road above, and the next moment he
was thrown violently down, blinded and pinned against the ledge by the
fall of some heavy body on his back and shoulders.His last flash of
consciousness was that he had been struck by a sack of flour slipped
from the pack of some passing mule.It was probably
not long, for his chilled hands and arms, thrust by the blow on his
shoulders into the pool of water, assisted in restoring him.He came
to with a sense of suffocating pressure on his back, but his head and
shoulders were swathed in utter darkness by the folds of some soft
fabrics and draperies, which, to his connecting consciousness, seemed as
if the contents of a broken bale or trunk had also fallen from the pack.With a tremendous effort he succeeded in getting his arm out of the
pool, and attempted to free his head from its blinding enwrappings.In
doing so his hand suddenly touched human flesh--a soft, bared arm!With
the same astounding discovery came one more terrible: that arm belonged
to the weight that was pressing him down; and now, assisted by his
struggles, it was slowly slipping toward the brink of the ledge and the
abyss below!With a desperate effort he turned on his side, caught the
body,--as such it was,--dragged it back on the ledge, at the same
moment that, freeing his head from its covering,--a feminine skirt,--he
discovered it was a woman!She had been also unconscious, although the touch of his cold, wet hand
on her skin had probably given her a shock that was now showing itself
in a convulsive shudder of her shoulders and a half opening of her eyes.Suddenly she began to stare at him, to draw in her knees and feet toward
her, sideways, with a feminine movement, as she smoothed out her skirt,
and kept it down with a hand on which she leaned.She was a tall,
handsome girl, from what he could judge of her half-sitting figure in
her torn silk dust-cloak, which, although its cape and one sleeve were
split into ribbons, had still protected her delicate, well-fitting gown
beneath."What--is it?--what has happened?"she said faintly, yet with a slight
touch of formality in her manner."You must have fallen--from the road above," said Bray hesitatingly.she repeated, with a slight frown, as if to
concentrate her thought.She glanced upward, then at the ledge before
her, and then, for the first time, at the darkening abyss below.The
color, which had begun to return, suddenly left her face here, and
she drew instinctively back against the mountain side."Yes," she half
murmured to herself, rather than to him, "it must be so.I was walking
too near the bank--and--I fell!"Then turning to him, she said, "And you
found me lying here when you came.""I think," stammered Bray, "that I was here when you fell, and I--I
broke the fall."She lifted her handsome gray eyes to him, saw the dust, dirt, and leaves
on his back and shoulders, the collar of his shirt torn open, and a
few spots of blood from a bruise on his forehead.Her black eyebrows
straightened again as she said coldly, "Dear me!I am very sorry; I
couldn't help it, you know."But you, are you sure you are not injured?"I'm not hurt," she said, helping herself to her feet by the aid of the
mountain-side bushes, and ignoring his proffered hand."But," she
added quickly and impressively, glancing upward toward the stage road
overhead, "why don't they come?I must have
been here a long time; it's too bad!""Yes," she said impatiently, "of course!I got out of the coach to walk uphill on the bank under
the trees.My foot must have slipped up
there--and--I--slid--down.Bray did not like to say he had only just recovered consciousness.But on turning around in her
impatience, she caught sight of the chasm again, and lapsed quite white
against the mountain side."Let me give you some water from the spring," he said eagerly, as she
sank again to a sitting posture; "it will refresh you."He looked hesitatingly around him; he had neither cup nor flask, but he
filled the pail and held it with great dexterity to her lips.She drank
a little, extracted a lace handkerchief from some hidden pocket, dipped
its point in the water, and wiped her face delicately, after a certain
feline fashion.Then, catching sight of some small object in the fork of
a bush above her, she quickly pounced upon it, and with a swift sweep
of her hand under her skirt, put on HER FALLEN SLIPPER, and stood on her
feet again."How does one get out of such a place?"she asked fretfully, and then,
glancing at him half indignantly, "why don't you shout?""I was going to tell you," he said gently, "that when you are a little
stronger, we can get out by the way I came in,--along the trail."He pointed to the narrow pathway along the perilous incline.Somehow,
with this tall, beautiful creature beside him, it looked more perilous
than before.She may have thought so too, for she drew in her breath
sharply and sank down again.she asked suddenly, opening her
gray eyes upon him.she went on, almost
impertinently.He stopped, and then it suddenly occurred
to him that after all there was no reason for his being bullied by this
tall, good-looking girl, even if he HAD saved her.He gave a little
laugh, and added mischievously, "Just like Jack and Jill, you know."she said sharply, bending her black brows at him."Jack and Jill," he returned carelessly; "I broke my crown, you know,
and YOU,"--he did not finish.She stared at him, trying to keep her face and her composure; but a
smile, that on her imperious lips he thought perfectly adorable, here
lifted the corners of her mouth, and she turned her face aside.But
the smile, and the line of dazzling little teeth it revealed, were
unfortunately on the side toward him.Emboldened by this, he went on,
"I couldn't think what had happened.At first I had a sort of idea that
part of a mule's pack had fallen on top of me,--blankets, flour, and all
that sort of thing, you know, until"--

Her smile had vanished."Well," she said impatiently, "until?"I'm afraid I gave you a shock; my hand was
dripping from the spring."She  so quickly that he knew she must have been conscious at the
time, and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak, which had been
half torn off her bare arm, was pinned together over it.When and how
had she managed to do it without his detecting the act?"At all events," she said coldly, "I'm glad you have not received
greater injury from--your mule pack.""I think we've both been very lucky," he said simply.She did not reply, but remained looking furtively at the narrow trail."I thought I heard voices," she said, half rising.You say there's no use--there's only this way out of it!""I might go up first, and perhaps get assistance--a rope or chair," he
suggested.she cried, with a horrified glance at the
abyss.I should be over that ledge before you came back!There's a dreadful fascination in it even now.I think I'd rather
go--at once!I never shall be stronger as long as I stay near it; I may
be weaker."She gave a petulant little shiver, and then, though paler and evidently
agitated, composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft,
ladylike way, and leaned back against the mountain side, He saw her also
glance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief, and with a
heightened color he quickly re-knotted it around his throat.They moved
from the ledge toward the trail."But it's only wide enough for ONE, and I never--NEVER--could even stand
on it a minute alone!""We will go together, side by side," he
said quietly, "but you will have to take the outside.""I shall keep hold of you," he explained; "you need not fear that.He untied the large bandanna silk handkerchief
which he wore around his shoulders, knotted one end of it firmly to his
belt, and handed her the other."Do you think you can hold on to that?""I--don't know,"--she hesitated.He pointed to a girdle of yellow
leather which caught her tunic around her small waist."Yes," she said eagerly, "it's real leather."He gently slipped the edge of the handkerchief under it and knotted it.They were thus linked together by a foot of handkerchief."I feel much safer," she said, with a faint smile."But if I should fall," he remarked, looking into her eyes, "you would
go too!"It would be really Jack
and Jill this time.""Now I must take YOUR arm," he said
laughingly; "not you MINE."He passed his arm under hers, holding it
firmly.For the first few steps her
uncertain feet took no hold of the sloping mountain side, which seemed
to slip sideways beneath her.He was literally carrying her on his
shoulder.But in a few moments she saw how cleverly he balanced himself,
always leaning toward the hillside, and presently she was able to help
him by a few steps."It's nothing; I carry a pail of water up here without spilling a drop."She stiffened slightly under this remark, and indeed so far overdid her
attempt to walk without his aid, that her foot slipped on a stone,
and she fell outward toward the abyss.But in an instant his arm was
transferred from her elbow to her waist, and in the momentum of his
quick recovery they both landed panting against the mountain side."I'm afraid you'd have spilt the pail that time," she said, with a
slightly heightened color, as she disengaged herself gently from his
arm."No," he answered boldly, "for the pail never would have stiffened
itself in a tiff, and tried to go alone.""Of course not, if it were only a pail," she responded.The trail was growing a little steeper
toward the upper end and the road bank.Bray was often himself obliged
to seek the friendly aid of a manzanita or thornbush to support them.Bray listened; he could hear at intervals a far-off shout; then a nearer
one--a name--"Eugenia."A sudden glow of
pleasure came over him--he knew not why, except that she did not look
delighted, excited, or even relieved."Only a few yards more," he said, with an unaffected half sigh."Then I'd better untie this," she suggested, beginning to fumble at the
knot of the handkerchief which linked them.Their heads were close together, their fingers often met; he would have
liked to say something, but he could only add: "Are you sure you will
feel quite safe?It is a little steeper as we near the bank.""You can hold me," she replied simply, with a superbly unconscious
lifting of her arm, as she yielded her waist to him again, but without
raising her eyes.He did,--holding her rather tightly, I fear, as they clambered up the
remaining <DW72>, for it seemed to him as a last embrace.As he lifted
her to the road bank, the shouts came nearer; and glancing up, he saw
two men and a woman running down the hill toward them.In that instant she had slipped the tattered dust-coat from her
shoulder, thrown it over her arm, set her hat straight, and was calmly
awaiting them with a self-possession and coolness that seemed to
shame their excitement.He noticed, too, with the quick perception of
unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments, that
she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side, and was
wearing it on her breast."You have alarmed us beyond measure--kept the stage waiting, and now it
is gone!"said the younger man, with brotherly brusqueness.As these questions were all uttered in the same breath, Eugenia replied
to them collectively."It was so hot that I kept along the bank here,
while you were on the other side.I heard the trickle of water somewhere
down there, and searching for it my foot slipped.This gentleman"--she
indicated Bray--"was on a little sort of a trail there, and assisted me
back to the road again."The two men and the woman turned and stared at Bray with a look of
curiosity that changed quickly into a half contemptuous unconcern.They
saw a youngish sort of man, with a long mustache, a two days' growth of
beard, a not overclean face, that was further streaked with red on the
temple, a torn flannel shirt, that showed a very white shoulder beside
a sunburnt throat and neck, and soiled white trousers stuck into muddy
high boots--in fact, the picture of a broken-down miner.But their
unconcern was as speedily changed again into resentment at the perfect
ease and equality with which he regarded them, a regard the more
exasperating as it was not without a suspicion of his perception of some
satire or humor in the situation.I--er"--

"The lady has thanked me," interrupted Bray, with a smile.said the younger man to Eugenia, ignoring Bray."Not far," she answered, with a half appealing look at Bray."Only a few feet," added the latter, with prompt mendacity, "just a
little slip down."The three new-comers here turned away, and, surrounding Eugenia,
conversed in an undertone.Quite conscious that he was the subject of
discussion, Bray lingered only in the hope of catching a parting glance
from Eugenia.The words "YOU do it," "No, YOU!""It would come better
from HER," were distinctly audible to him.To his surprise, however,
she suddenly broke through them, and advancing to him, with a dangerous
brightness in her beautiful eyes, held out her slim hand.Neworth, my brother, Harry Neworth, and my aunt, Mrs.Dobbs," she
said, indicating each one with a graceful inclination of her handsome
head, "all think I ought to give you something and send you away.I
believe that is the way they put it.I come to
ask you to let me once more thank you for your good service to me
to-day--which I shall never forget."When he had returned her firm
handclasp for a minute, she coolly rejoined the discomfited group."She's no sardine," said Bray to himself emphatically, "but I suspect
she'll catch it from her folks for this.I ought to have gone away at
once, like a gentleman, hang it!"He was even angrily debating with himself whether he ought not to follow
her to protect her from her gesticulating relations as they all trailed
up the hill with her, when he reflected that it would only make matters
worse.And with it came the dreadful reflection that as yet he had
not carried the water to his expecting and thirsty comrades.He
had forgotten them for these lazy, snobbish, purse-proud San
Franciscans--for Bray had the miner's supreme contempt for the moneyed
trading classes.He flung himself over
the bank, and hastened recklessly down the trail to the spring.But here
again he lingered--the place had become suddenly hallowed.He gazed eagerly around on the ledge for any
trace that she had left--a bow, a bit of ribbon, or even a hairpin that
had fallen from her.As the young man slowly filled the pail he caught sight of his own
reflection in the spring.It certainly was not that of an Adonis!He laughed honestly; his sense of humor had saved him from many an
extravagance, and mitigated many a disappointment before this.She
was a plucky, handsome girl--even if she was not for him, and he might
never set eyes on her again.Yet it was a hard pull up that trail once
more, carrying an insensible pail of water in the hand that had once
sustained a lovely girl!He remembered her reply to his badinage,
"Of course not--if it were only a pail," and found a dozen pretty
interpretations of it.He was too poor and
too level headed for that!And he was unaffectedly and materially tired,
too, when he reached the road again, and rested, leaving the spring and
its little idyl behind.By this time the sun had left the burning ledge of the Eureka Company,
and the stage road was also in shadow, so that his return through its
heavy dust was less difficult.And when he at last reached the camp, he
found to his relief that his prolonged absence had been overlooked by
his thirsty companions in a larger excitement and disappointment; for
it appeared that a well-known San Francisco capitalist, whom the
foreman had persuaded to visit their claim with a view to advance and
investment, had actually come over from Red Dog for that purpose, and
had got as far as the summit when he was stopped by an accident, and
delayed so long that he was obliged to go on to Sacramento without
making his examination."That was only his excuse--mere flap-doodle!"interrupted the
pessimistic Jerrold."He was foolin' you; he'd heard of suthin better!The idea of calling that affair an 'accident,' or one that would stop
any man who meant business!""A d----d fool woman's accident," broke in the misogynist Parkhurst,
"and it's true!That's what makes it so cussed mean.For there's allus
a woman at the bottom of such things--bet your life!Think of 'em comin'
here.Thar ought to be a law agin it.""Why, what does that blasted fool of a capitalist do but bring with him
his daughter and auntie to'see the wonderful scenery with popa
dear!'as if it was a cheap Sunday-school panorama!And what do these
chuckle-headed women do but get off the coach and go to wanderin'
about, and playin' 'here we go round the mulberry bush' until one of 'em
tumbles down a ravine.and 'dear popa'
was up and down the road yellin' 'Me cheyld!And then there
was camphor and sal volatile and eau de cologne to be got, and the coach
goes off, and 'popa dear' gets left, and then has to hurry off in a
buggy to catch it.So WE get left too, just because that God-forsaken
fool, Neworth, brings his women here."Under this recital poor Bray sat as completely crushed as when the fair
daughter of Neworth had descended upon his shoulders at the spring.It was HIS delay and dalliance with her
that had checked Neworth's visit; worse than that, it was his subsequent
audacity and her defense of him that would probably prevent any renewal
of the negotiations.He had shipwrecked his partners' prospects in his
absurd vanity and pride!He did not dare to raise his eyes to their
dejected faces.He would have confessed everything to them, but the
same feeling of delicacy for her which had determined him to keep her
adventures to himself now forever sealed his lips.How might they not
misconstrue his conduct--and HERS!Perhaps something of this was visible
in his face."Come, old man," said the cheerful misogynist, with perfect innocence,
"don't take it so hard.Some time in a man's life a woman's sure to get
the drop on him, as I said afore, and this yer woman's got the drop on
five of us!But--hallo, Ned, old man--what's the matter with your head?"He laid his hand gently on the matted temple of his younger partner."I had--a slip--on the trail," he stammered."Had to go back again for
another pailful.That's what delayed me, you know, boys," he added.ejaculated Parkhurst, clapping him on the back and twisting
him around by the shoulders so that he faced his companions.Look at him, gentlemen; and he says it's 'nothing.'That's how a MAN
takes it!HE didn't go round yellin' and wringin' his hands and sayin'
'Me pay-l!He just humped himself and trotted
back for another.And yet every drop of water in that overset bucket
meant hard work and hard sweat, and was as precious as gold."Luckily for Bray, whose mingled emotions under Parkhurst's eloquence
were beginning to be hysterical, the foreman interrupted.it's time we got to work again, and took another heave at
the old ledge!But now that this job of Neworth's is over--I don't mind
tellin' ye suthin."As their leader usually spoke but little, and to
the point, the four men gathered around him."Although I engineered this
affair, and got it up, somehow, I never SAW that Neworth standing on
this ledge!The look of superstition
which Bray and the others had often seen on this old miner's face,
and which so often showed itself in his acts, was there."And though I
wanted him to come, and allowed to have him come, I'm kinder relieved
that he didn't, and so let whatsoever luck's in the air come to us five
alone, boys, just as we stand."The next morning Bray was up before his companions, and although it was
not his turn, offered to bring water from the spring.He was not in love
with Eugenia--he had not forgotten his remorse of the previous day--but
he would like to go there once more before he relentlessly wiped out her
image from his mind.And he had heard that although Neworth had gone on
to Sacramento, his son and the two ladies had stopped on for a day or
two at the ditch superintendent's house on the summit, only two miles
away.She might pass on the road; he might get a glimpse of her again
and a wave of her hand before this thing was over forever, and he should
have to take up the daily routine of his work again.It was not love--of
THAT he was assured--but it was the way to stop it by convincing himself
of its madness.Besides, in view of all the circumstances, it was his
duty as a gentleman to show some concern for her condition after the
accident and the disagreeable contretemps which followed it.He found the
spring had simply lapsed into its previous unsuggestive obscurity,--a
mere niche in the mountain side that held only--water!The stage road
was deserted save for an early, curly-headed schoolboy, whom he found
lurking on the bank, but who evaded his company and conversation.He returned to the camp quite cured of his fancy.His late zeal as a
water-carrier had earned him a day or two's exemption from that duty.His place was taken the next afternoon by the woman-hating Parkhurst,
and he was the less concerned by it as he had heard that the same
afternoon the ladies were to leave the summit for Sacramento.The new water-bringer was
as scandalously late in his delivery of the precious fluid as his
predecessor!His unfortunate
partners, toiling away with pick and crowbar on the burning ledge, were
clamorous from thirst, and Bray was becoming absurdly uneasy.It could
not be possible that Eugenia's accident had been repeated!The mystery
was presently cleared, however, by the abrupt appearance of Parkhurst
running towards them, but WITHOUT HIS PAIL!The cry of consternation and
despair which greeted that discovery was, however, quickly changed by
a single breathless, half intelligible sentence he had shot before him
from his panting lips.And he was holding something in his outstretched
palm that was more eloquent than words.In an instant they had him under the shade of the pine-tree, and were
squatting round him like schoolboys.His story, far from being brief, was incoherent and at times seemed
irrelevant, but that was characteristic.They would remember that he had
always held the theory that, even in quartz mining, the deposits were
always found near water, past or present, with signs of fluvial erosion!He didn't call himself one of your blanked scientific miners, but his
head was level!It was all very well for them to say "Yes, yes!"NOW,
but they didn't use to!when he got to the spring, he noticed
that there had been a kind of landslide above it, of course, from water
cleavage, and there was a distinct mark of it on the mountain side,
where it had uprooted and thrown over some small bushes!Excited as Bray was, he recognized with a hysterical sensation the track
made by Eugenia in her fall, which he himself had noticed."When I saw that," continued Parkhurst, more rapidly and coherently,
"I saw that there was a crack above the hole where the water came
through--as if it had been the old channel of the spring.I widened it
a little with my clasp knife, and then--in a little pouch or pocket of
decomposed quartz--I found that!Not only that, boys," he continued,
rising, with a shout, "but the whole <DW72> above the spring is a mass of
seepage underneath, as if you'd played a hydraulic hose on it, and it's
ready to tumble and is just rotten with quartz!"The men leaped to their feet; in another moment they had snatched picks,
pans, and shovels, and, the foreman leading, with a coil of rope thrown
over his shoulders, were all flying down the trail to the highway.The spring was not on THEIR claim; it was known to
others; it was doubtful if Parkhurst's discovery with his knife amounted
to actual WORK on the soil.They must "take it up" with a formal notice,
and get to work at once!In an hour they were scattered over the mountain side, like bees
clinging to the fragrant <DW72> of laurel and myrtle above the spring.An
excavation was made beside it, and the ledge broadened by a dozen
feet.Even the spring itself was utilized to wash the hastily filled
prospecting pans.And when the Pioneer Coach slowly toiled up the road
that afternoon, the passengers stared at the scarcely dry "Notice of
Location" pinned to the pine by the road bank, whence Eugenia had fallen
two days before!Eagerly and anxiously as Edward Bray worked with his companions, it was
with more conflicting feelings.There was a certain sense of desecration
in their act.How her proud lip would have curled had she seen him--he
who but a few hours before would have searched the whole <DW72> for
the treasure of a ribbon, a handkerchief, or a bow from her dress--now
delving and picking the hillside for that fortune her accident had so
mysteriously disclosed.Mysteriously he believed, for he had not fully
accepted Parkhurst's story.That gentle misogynist had never been an
active prospector; an inclination to theorize without practice and to
combat his partners' experience were all against his alleged process of
discovery, although the gold was actually there; and his conduct that
afternoon was certainly peculiar.He did but little of the real
work; but wandered from man to man, with suggestions, advice, and
exhortations, and the air of a superior patron.This might have been
characteristic, but mingled with it was a certain nervous anxiety and
watchfulness.He was continually scanning the stage road and the trail,
staring eagerly at any wayfarer in the distance, and at times falling
into fits of strange abstraction.At other times he would draw near to
one of his fellow partners, as if for confidential disclosure, and then
check himself and wander aimlessly away.And it was not until evening
came that the mystery was solved.The prospecting pans had been duly washed and examined, the <DW72> above
and below had been fully explored and tested, with a result and promise
that outran their most sanguine hopes.There was no mistaking the fact
that they had made a "big" strike.That singular gravity and reticence,
so often observed in miners at these crises, had come over them as
they sat that night for the last time around their old camp-fire on
the Eureka ledge, when Parkhurst turned impulsively to Bray."Roll over
here," he said in a whisper."I want to tell ye suthin!"Bray "rolled" beyond the squatting circle, and the two men gradually
edged themselves out of hearing of the others.In the silent abstraction
that prevailed nobody noticed them."It's got suthin to do with this discovery," said Parkhurst, in a low,
mysterious tone, "but as far as the gold goes, and our equal rights to
it as partners, it don't affect them.If I," he continued in a slightly
patronizing, paternal tone, "choose to make you and the other boys
sharers in what seems to be a special Providence to ME, I reckon we
won't quarrel on it.It's one
of those things ye read about in books and don't take any stock in!But
we've got the gold--and I've got the black and white to prove it--even
if it ain't exactly human."His voice sank so low, his manner was so impressive, that despite his
known exaggeration, Bray felt a slight thrill of superstition.Meantime
Parkhurst wiped his brow, took a folded slip of paper and a sprig of
laurel from his pocket, and drew a long breath."When I got to the spring this afternoon," he went on, in a nervous,
tremulous, and scarcely audible voice, "I saw this bit o' paper, folded
note-wise, lyin' on the ledge before it.On top of it was this sprig
of laurel, to catch the eye.I ain't the man to pry into other folks'
secrets, or read what ain't mine.But on the back o' this note was
written 'To Jack!'It's a common enough name, but it's a singular thing,
ef you'll recollect, thar ain't ANOTHER Jack in this company, not on the
whole ridge betwixt this and the summit, except MYSELF!So I opened it,
and this is what it read!"He held the paper sideways toward the leaping
light of the still near camp-fire, and read slowly, with the emphasis of
having read it many times before."'I want you to believe that I, at least, respect and honor your honest,
manly calling, and when you strike it rich, as you surely will, I hope
you will sometimes think of Jill.'"In the thrill of joy, hope, and fear that came over Bray, he could see
that Parkhurst had not only failed to detect his secret, but had not
even connected the two names with their obvious suggestion."But do you
know anybody named Jill?""It's no NAME," said Parkhurst in a sombre voice, "it's a THING!""Yes, a measure--you know--two fingers of whiskey.""Oh, a 'gill,'" said Bray."That's what I said, young man," returned Parkhurst gravely.Bray choked back a hysterical laugh; spelling was notoriously not one of
Parkhurst's strong points."But what has a 'gill' got to do with it?""It's one of them Sphinx things, don't you see?A sort of riddle or
rebus, you know.You've got to study it out, as them old chaps did."Pints, I suppose," said Bray."QUARTZ, and there you are.So I looked about me for quartz, and sure
enough struck it the first pop."Bray cast a quick look at Parkhurst's grave face.The man was evidently
impressed and sincere.or you'll spoil the charm, and bring us ill luck!I really don't know that you ought to have told
me," added the artful Bray, dissembling his intense joy at this proof of
Eugenia's remembrance."But," said Parkhurst blankly, "you see, old man, you'd been the last
man at the spring, and I kinder thought"--

"Don't think," said Bray promptly, "and above all, don't talk; not a
word to the boys of this.I've
got to go to San Francisco next week, and I'll take care of it and think
it out!"He knew that Parkhurst might be tempted to talk, but without
the paper his story would be treated lightly.Parkhurst handed him the
paper, and the two men returned to the camp-fire.The superstition of the lover is
no less keen than that of the gambler, and Bray, while laughing at
Parkhurst's extravagant fancy, I am afraid was equally inclined to
believe that their good fortune came through Eugenia's influence.At least he should tell her so, and her precious note became now an
invitation as well as an excuse for seeking her.The only fear that
possessed him was that she might have expected some acknowledgment of
her note before she left that afternoon; the only thing he could not
understand was how she had managed to convey the note to the spring,
for she could not have taken it herself.But this would doubtless be
explained by her in San Francisco, whither he intended to seek her.His
affairs, the purchasing of machinery for their new claim, would no doubt
give him easy access to her father.But it was one thing to imagine this while procuring a new and
fashionable outfit in San Francisco, and quite another to stand before
the "palatial" residence of the Neworths on Rincon Hill, with the
consciousness of no other introduction than the memory of the Neworths'
discourtesy on the mountain, and, even in his fine feathers, Bray
hesitated.At this moment a carriage rolled up to the door, and Eugenia,
an adorable vision of laces and silks, alighted.Forgetting everything else, he advanced toward her with outstretched
hand.He saw her start, a faint color come into her face; he knew he
was recognized; but she stiffened quickly again, the color vanished, her
beautiful gray eyes rested coldly on him for a moment, and then, with
the faintest inclination of her proud head, she swept by him and entered
the house.But Bray, though shocked, was not daunted, and perhaps his own pride was
awakened.He ran to his hotel, summoned a messenger, inclosed her note
in an envelope, and added these lines:--


DEAR MISS NEWORTH,--I only wanted to thank you an hour ago, as I should
like to have done before, for the kind note which I inclose, but which
you have made me feel I have no right to treasure any longer, and to
tell you that your most generous wish and prophecy has been more than
fulfilled.Yours, very gratefully,

EDMUND BRAY.Within the hour the messenger returned with the still briefer reply:--

"Miss Neworth has been fully aware of that preoccupation with his good
fortune which prevented Mr.Bray from an earlier acknowledgment of her
foolish note."Cold as this response was, Bray's heart leaped.She HAD lingered on the
summit, and HAD expected a reply.He seized his hat, and, jumping into
the first cab at the hotel door, drove rapidly back to the house.He
had but one idea, to see her at any cost, but one concern, to avoid a
meeting with her father first, or a denial at her very door.He dismissed the cab at the street corner and began to reconnoitre the
house.It had a large garden in the rear, reclaimed from the adjacent
"scrub oak" infested sand hill, and protected by a high wall.If he
could scale that wall, he could command the premises.It was a bright
morning; she might be tempted into the garden.A taller scrub oak grew
near the wall; to the mountain-bred Bray it was an easy matter to swing
himself from it to the wall, and he did.But his momentum was so great
that he touched the wall only to be obliged to leap down into the garden
to save himself from falling there.He heard a little cry, felt his feet
strike some tin utensil, and rolled on the ground beside Eugenia and her
overturned watering-pot.They both struggled to their feet with an astonishment that turned to
laughter in their eyes and the same thought in the minds of each."But we are not on the mountains now, Mr.Bray," said Eugenia, taking
her handkerchief at last from her sobering face and straightening
eyebrows."But we are quits," said Bray.I only
came here to tell you why I could not answer your letter the same day.I
never got it--I mean," he added hurriedly, "another man got it first."She threw up her head, and her face grew pale."ANOTHER man got it," she
repeated, "and YOU let another man"--

"No, no," interrupted Bray imploringly.One of my
partners went to the spring that afternoon, and found it; but he neither
knows who sent it, nor for whom it was intended."He hastily recounted
Parkhurst's story, his mysterious belief, and his interpretation of
the note.The color came back to her face and the smile to her lips and
eyes."I had gone twice to the spring after I saw you, but I couldn't
bear its deserted look without you," he added boldly.Here, seeing her
face grew grave again, he added, "But how did you get the letter to the
spring?and how did you know that it was found that day?"It was her turn to look embarrassed and entreating, but the combination
was charming in her proud face."I got the little schoolboy at the
summit," she said, with girlish hesitation, "to take the note.He knew
the spring, but he didn't know YOU.I told him--it was very foolish, I
know--to wait until you came for water, to be certain that you got the
note, to wait until you came up, for I thought you might question him,
or give him some word.""But," she added,
and her lip took a divine pout, "he said he waited TWO HOURS; that you
never took the LEAST CONCERN of the letter or him, but went around the
mountain side, peering and picking in every hole and corner of it, and
then he got tired and ran away.Of course I understand it now, it wasn't
YOU; but oh, please; I beg you, Mr.Bray released the little hand which he had impulsively caught, and which
had allowed itself to be detained for a blissful moment."And now, don't you think, Mr.Bray," she added demurely, "that you had
better let me fill my pail again while you go round to the front door
and call upon me properly?""But your father"--

"My father, as a well-known investor, regrets exceedingly that he did
not make your acquaintance more thoroughly in his late brief interview.He is, as your foreman knows, exceedingly interested in the mines on
Eureka ledge.She led him to a little
door in the wall, which she unbolted."And now 'Jill' must say good-by
to 'Jack,' for she must make herself ready to receive a Mr.And when Bray a little later called at the front door, he was
respectfully announced.He called another day, and many days after.He
came frequently to San Francisco, and one day did not return to his old
partners.He had entered into a new partnership with one who he declared
"had made the first strike on Eureka mountain."BILSON'S HOUSEKEEPER


I

When Joshua Bilson, of the Summit House, Buckeye Hill, lost his wife,
it became necessary for him to take a housekeeper to assist him in the
management of the hotel.Already all Buckeye had considered this a mere
preliminary to taking another wife, after a decent probation, as the
relations of housekeeper and landlord were confidential and delicate,
and Bilson was a man, and not above female influence.There was,
however, some change of opinion on that point when Miss Euphemia Trotter
was engaged for that position.Buckeye Hill, which had confidently
looked forward to a buxom widow or, with equal confidence, to the
promotion of some pretty but inefficient chambermaid, was startled
by the selection of a maiden lady of middle age, and above the medium
height, at once serious, precise, and masterful, and to all appearances
outrageously competent.More carefully "taking stock" of her, it was
accepted she had three good points,--dark, serious eyes, a trim but
somewhat thin figure, and well-kept hands and feet.These, which in
so susceptible a community would have been enough, in the words of one
critic, "to have married her to three men," she seemed to make of little
account herself, and her attitude toward those who were inclined to make
them of account was ceremonious and frigid.Indeed, she seemed to occupy
herself entirely with looking after the servants, Chinese and Europeans,
examining the bills and stores of traders and shopkeepers, in a fashion
that made her respected and--feared.It was whispered, in fact, that
Bilson stood in awe of her as he never had of his wife, and that he was
"henpecked in his own farmyard by a strange pullet."Nevertheless, he always spoke of her with a respect and even a reverence
that seemed incompatible with their relative positions.It gave rise
to surmises more or less ingenious and conflicting: Miss Trotter had a
secret interest in the hotel, and represented a San Francisco syndicate;
Miss Trotter was a woman of independent property, and had advanced large
sums to Bilson; Miss Trotter was a woman of no property, but she was
the only daughter of--variously--a late distinguished nobleman, a ruined
millionaire, and a foreign statesman, bent on making her own living.Miss Euphemia Trotter, or "Miss E. Trotter," as she
preferred to sign herself, loathing her sentimental prefix, was really
a poor girl who had been educated in an Eastern seminary, where
she eventually became a teacher.She had survived her parents and a
neglected childhood, and had worked hard for her living since she
was fourteen.She had been a nurse in a hospital, an assistant in a
reformatory, had observed men and women under conditions of pain and
weakness, and had known the body only as a tabernacle of helplessness
and suffering; yet had brought out of her experience a hard philosophy
which she used equally to herself as to others.That she had ever
indulged in any romance of human existence, I greatly doubt; the lanky
girl teacher at the Vermont academy had enough to do to push herself
forward without entangling girl friendships or confidences, and so
became a prematurely hard duenna, paid to look out for, restrain, and
report, if necessary, any vagrant flirtation or small intrigue of her
companions.A pronounced "old maid" at fifteen, she had nothing to
forget or forgive in others, and still less to learn from them.It was spring, and down the long <DW72>s of Buckeye Hill the flowers were
already effacing the last dented footprints of the winter rains, and the
winds no longer brought their monotonous patter.In the pine woods there
were the song and flash of birds, and the quickening stimulus of the
stirring aromatic sap.Miners and tunnelmen were already forsaking
the direct road for a ramble through the woodland trail and its sylvan
charms, and occasionally breaking into shouts and horseplay like great
boys.The schoolchildren were disporting there; there were some older
couples sentimentally gathering flowers side by side.Miss Trotter was
also there, but making a short cut from the bank and express office, and
by no means disturbed by any gentle reminiscence of her girlhood or any
other instinctive participation in the wanton season.Spring came, she
knew, regularly every year, and brought "spring cleaning" and other
necessary changes and rehabilitations.This year it had brought also
a considerable increase in the sum she was putting by, and she
was, perhaps, satisfied in a practical way, if not with the blind
instinctiveness of others.She was walking leisurely, holding her gray
skirt well over her slim ankles and smartly booted feet, and clear of
the brushing of daisies and buttercups, when suddenly she stopped.A few
paces before her, partly concealed by a myrtle, a young woman, startled
at her approach, had just withdrawn herself from the embrace of a young
man and slipped into the shadow.Nevertheless, in that moment, Miss
Trotter's keen eyes had recognized her as a very pretty Swedish girl,
one of her chambermaids at the hotel.Miss Trotter passed without a
word, but gravely.She was not shocked nor surprised, but it struck
her practical mind at once that if this were an affair with impending
matrimony, it meant the loss of a valuable and attractive servant; if
otherwise, a serious disturbance of that servant's duties.She must look
out for another girl to take the place of Frida Pauline Jansen, that
was all.It is possible, therefore, that Miss Jansen's criticism of Miss
Trotter to her companion as a "spying, jealous old cat" was unfair.This
companion Miss Trotter had noticed, only to observe that his face and
figure were unfamiliar to her.His red shirt and heavy boots gave no
indication of his social condition in that locality.He seemed more
startled and disturbed at her intrusion than the girl had been, but
that was more a condition of sex than of degree, she also knew.In
such circumstances it is the woman always who is the most composed and
self-possessed.A few days after this, Miss Trotter was summoned in some haste to the
office.Chris Calton, a young man of twenty-six, partner in the Roanoke
Ledge, had fractured his arm and collar-bone by a fall, and had been
brought to the hotel for that rest and attention, under medical advice,
which he could not procure in the Roanoke company's cabin.She had
a retired, quiet room made ready.When he was installed there by the
doctor she went to see him, and found a good-looking, curly headed young
fellow, even boyish in appearance and manner, who received her with that
air of deference and timidity which she was accustomed to excite in the
masculine breast--when it was not accompanied with distrust.It struck
her that he was somewhat emotional, and had the expression of one who
had been spoiled and petted by women, a rather unusual circumstance
among the men of the locality.Perhaps it would be unfair to her to say
that a disposition to show him that he could expect no such "nonsense"
THERE sprang up in her heart at that moment, for she never had
understood any tolerance of such weakness, but a certain precision and
dryness of manner was the only result of her observation.She adjusted
his pillow, asked him if there was anything that he wanted, but took her
directions from the doctor, rather than from himself, with a practical
insight and minuteness that was as appalling to the patient as it was an
unexpected delight to Dr."I see you quite understand me, Miss
Trotter," he said, with great relief."I ought to," responded the lady dryly."I had a dozen such cases, some
of them with complications, while I was assistant at the Sacramento
Hospital."returned the doctor, dropping gladly into purely
professional detail, "you'll see this is very simple, not a comminuted
fracture; constitution and blood healthy; all you've to do is to see
that he eats properly, keeps free from excitement and worry, but does
not get despondent; a little company; his partners and some of the boys
from the Ledge will drop in occasionally; not too much of THEM, you
know; and of course, absolute immobility of the injured parts."The lady
nodded; the patient lifted his blue eyes for an instant to hers with
a look of tentative appeal, but it slipped off Miss Trotter's dark
pupils--which were as abstractedly critical as the doctor's--without
being absorbed by them.When the door closed behind her, the doctor
exclaimed: "By Jove!"Do what
she says, and we'll pull you through in no time.she's able to
adjust those bandages herself!"This, indeed, she did a week later, when the surgeon had failed to call,
unveiling his neck and arm with professional coolness, and supporting
him in her slim arms against her stiff, erect buckramed breast, while
she replaced the splints with masculine firmness of touch and serene
and sexless indifference.His stammered embarrassed thanks at the
relief--for he had been in considerable pain--she accepted with a
certain pride as a tribute to her skill, a tribute which Dr.Duchesne
himself afterward fully indorsed.On re-entering his room the third or fourth morning after his advent at
the Summit House, she noticed with some concern that there was a slight
flush on his cheek and a certain exaltation which she at first thought
presaged fever.But an examination of his pulse and temperature
dispelled that fear, and his talkativeness and good spirits convinced
her that it was only his youthful vigor at last overcoming his
despondency.A few days later, this cheerfulness not being continued,
Dr.Duchesne followed Miss Trotter into the hall."We must try to keep
our patient from moping in his confinement, you know," he began, with
a slight smile, "and he seems to be somewhat of an emotional nature,
accustomed to be amused and--er--er--petted.""His friends were here yesterday," returned Miss Trotter dryly, "but I
did not interfere with them until I thought they had stayed long enough
to suit your wishes.""I am not referring to THEM," said the doctor, still smiling; "but you
know a woman's sympathy and presence in a sickroom is often the best of
tonics or sedatives."Miss Trotter raised her eyes to the speaker with a half critical
impatience."The fact is," the doctor went on, "I have a favor to ask of you for our
patient.It seems that the other morning a new chambermaid waited upon
him, whom he found much more gentle and sympathetic in her manner than
the others, and more submissive and quiet in her ways--possibly because
she is a foreigner, and accustomed to servitude.I suppose you have no
objection to HER taking charge of his room?"Not from wounded vanity, but
from the consciousness of some want of acumen that had made her make a
mistake.She had really believed, from her knowledge of the patient's
character and the doctor's preamble, that he wished HER to show some
more kindness and personal sympathy to the young man, and had even been
prepared to question its utility!She saw her blunder quickly, and at
once remembering that the pretty Swedish girl had one morning taken the
place of an absent fellow servant, in the rebound from her error, she
said quietly: "You mean Frida!she can look after his
room, if he prefers her."But for her blunder she might have added
conscientiously that she thought the girl would prove inefficient, but
she did not.She remembered the incident of the wood; yet if the girl
had a lover in the wood, she could not urge it as a proof of incapacity.She gave the necessary orders, and the incident passed.Visiting the patient a few days afterward, she could not help noticing a
certain shy gratitude in Mr.Calton's greeting of her, which she quietly
ignored.This forced the ingenuous Chris to more positive speech.He dwelt with great simplicity and enthusiasm on the Swedish girl's
gentleness and sympathy."You have no idea of--her--natural tenderness,
Miss Trotter," he stammered naively.Miss Trotter, remembering the
wood, thought to herself that she had some faint idea of it, but did not
impart what it was.He spoke also of her beauty, not being clever enough
to affect an indifference or ignorance of it, which made Miss Trotter
respect him and smile an unqualified acquiescence.But when he spoke of her as "Miss Jansen," and said she was so
much more "ladylike and refined than the other servants," she replied by
asking him if his bandages hurt him, and, receiving a negative answer,
graciously withdrew.Indeed, his bandages gave him little trouble now, and his improvement
was so marked and sustained that the doctor was greatly gratified,
and, indeed, expressed as much to Miss Trotter, with the conscientious
addition that he believed the greater part of it was due to her capable
nursing!"Yes, ma'am, he has to thank YOU for it, and no one else!"Miss Trotter raised her dark eyes and looked steadily at him.Accustomed
as he was to men and women, the look strongly held him.He saw in her
eyes an intelligence equal to his own, a knowledge of good and evil, and
a toleration and philosophy, equal to his own, but a something else that
was as distinct and different as their sex.And therein lay its charm,
for it merely translated itself in his mind that she had very pretty
eyes, which he had never noticed before, without any aggressive
intellectual quality.came the man's propensity to
reason.It meant of course but ONE thing; he saw it all now!If HE, in
his preoccupation and coolness, had noticed her eyes, so also had the
younger and emotional Chris.It
was that which had stimulated his recovery, and she was wondering if he,
the doctor, had observed it.He smiled back the superior smile of our
sex in moments of great inanity, and poor Miss Trotter believed he
understood her.A few days after this, she noticed that Frida Jansen was
wearing a pearl ring and a somewhat ostentatious locket.Bilson had told her that the Roanoke Ledge was very rich,
and that Calton was likely to prove a profitable guest.It became her business, however, some days later, when Mr.Calton was so
much better that he could sit in a chair, or even lounge listlessly
in the hall and corridor.It so chanced that she was passing along
the upper hall when she saw Frida's pink cotton skirt disappear in an
adjacent room, and heard her light laugh as the door closed.But the
room happened to be a card-room reserved exclusively for gentlemen's
poker or euchre parties, and the chambermaids had no business there.Miss Trotter had no doubt that Mr.Calton was there, and that Frida knew
it; but as this was an indiscretion so open, flagrant, and likely to be
discovered by the first passing guest, she called to her sharply.She
was astonished, however, at the same moment to see Mr.Calton walking in
the corridor at some distance from the room in question.Indeed, she was
so confounded that when Frida appeared from the room a little flurried,
but with a certain audacity new to her, Miss Trotter withheld her
rebuke, and sent her off on an imaginary errand, while she herself
opened the card-room door.Bilson, her employer;
his explanation was glaringly embarrassed and unreal!Miss Trotter
affected obliviousness, but was silent; perhaps she thought her employer
was better able to take care of himself than Mr.A week later this tension terminated by the return of Calton to Roanoke
Ledge, a convalescent man.A very pretty watch and chain afterward were
received by Miss Trotter, with a few lines expressing the gratitude of
the ex-patient.Bilson was highly delighted, and frequently borrowed
the watch to show to his guests as an advertisement of the healing
powers of the Summit Hotel.Calton sent to the more attractive
and flirtatious Frida did not as publicly appear, and possibly Mr.Since that discovery, Miss Trotter had felt herself debarred from taking
the girl's conduct into serious account, and it did not interfere with
her work.II

One afternoon Miss Trotter received a message that Mr.Calton desired
a few moments' private conversation with her.A little curious, she had
him shown into one of the sitting-rooms, but was surprised on entering
to find that she was in the presence of an utter stranger!This was
explained by the visitor saying briefly that he was Chris's elder
brother, and that he presumed the name would be sufficient introduction.Miss Trotter smiled doubtfully, for a more distinct opposite to Chris
could not be conceived.The stranger was apparently strong, practical,
and masterful in all those qualities in which his brother was charmingly
weak.Miss Trotter, for no reason whatever, felt herself inclined to
resent them."I reckon, Miss Trotter," he said bluntly, "that you don't know anything
of this business that brings me here.At least," he hesitated, with a
certain rough courtesy, "I should judge from your general style and gait
that you wouldn't have let it go on so far if you had, but the fact is,
that darned fool brother of mine--beg your pardon!--has gone and got
himself engaged to one of the girls that help here,--a yellow-haired
foreigner, called Frida Jansen.""I was not aware that it had gone so far as that," said Miss Trotter
quietly, "although his admiration for her was well known, especially to
his doctor, at whose request I selected her to especially attend to your
brother.""The doctor is a fool," broke in Mr."He only thought
of keeping Chris quiet while he finished his job."Calton," continued Miss Trotter, ignoring the
interruption, "I do not see what right I have to interfere with the
matrimonial intentions of any guest in this house, even though or--as
you seem to put it--BECAUSE the object of his attentions is in its
employ."Calton stared--angrily at first, and then with a kind of wondering
amazement that any woman--above all a housekeeper--should take such a
view."But," he stammered, "I thought you--you--looked after the conduct
of those girls.""I'm afraid you've assumed too much," said Miss Trotter placidly."My
business is to see that they attend to their duties here.Frida Jansen's
duty was--as I have just told you--to look after your brother's room.And as far as I understand you, you are not here to complain of her
inattention to that duty, but of its resulting in an attachment on your
brother's part, and, as you tell me, an intention as to her future,
which is really the one thing that would make my 'looking after her
conduct' an impertinence and interference!If you had come to tell me
that he did NOT intend to marry her, but was hurting her reputation, I
could have understood and respected your motives."Calton felt his face grow red and himself discomfited.He had come
there with the firm belief that he would convict Miss Trotter of a grave
fault, and that in her penitence she would be glad to assist him in
breaking off the match.On the contrary, to find himself arraigned and
put on his defense by this tall, slim woman, erect and smartly buckramed
in logic and whalebone, was preposterous!But it had the effect of
subduing his tone."You don't understand," he said awkwardly yet pleadingly."My brother is
a fool, and any woman could wind him round her finger.She knows he is rich and a partner in the Roanoke Ledge.I've said he was a fool--but,
hang it all!that's no reason why he should marry an ignorant girl--a
foreigner and a servant--when he could do better elsewhere.""This would seem to be a matter between you and your brother, and not
between myself and my servant," said Miss Trotter coldly."If you
cannot convince HIM, your own brother, I do not see how you expect me
to convince HER, a servant, over whom I have no control except as a
mistress of her WORK, when, on your own showing, she has everything
to gain by the marriage.Bilson, the proprietor, to
threaten her with dismissal unless she gives up your brother,"--Miss
Trotter smiled inwardly at the thought of the card-room incident,--"it
seems to me you might only precipitate the marriage."His reason told him
that she was right.More than that, a certain admiration for her
clear-sightedness began to possess him, with the feeling that he would
like to have "shown up" a little better than he had in this interview.If Chris had fallen in love with HER--but Chris was a fool and wouldn't
have appreciated her!"But you might talk with her, Miss Trotter," he said, now completely
subdued."Even if you could not reason her out of it, you might find
out what she expects from this marriage.If you would talk to her as
sensibly as you have to me"--

"It is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have," said
Miss Trotter, with a faint smile which Mr.Calton thought quite pretty,
"but I will see about it."Whatever Miss Trotter intended to do did not transpire.She certainly
was in no hurry about it, as she did not say anything to Frida that day,
and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank
and post-office.Her way home again lay through the Summit woods.It
recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to
Frida's flirtations.Bilson's presumed gallantries,
however, seemed inconsistent, in Miss Trotter's knowledge of the world,
with a serious engagement with young Calton.She was neither shocked nor
horrified by it, and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to
speak of it to the elder Mr.Her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood;
the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides, where, long
ago, a girl teacher, she had walked with the girl pupils of the Vermont
academy, and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains.She
smiled--a little sadly--as the thought occurred to her that after this
interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow
affections.Should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex;
never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion?Young Calton
had not confessed his passion to HER, nor had Frida revealed her secret.Only the elder brother had appealed to her hard, practical common sense
against such sentiment.Was there something in her manner that forbade
it?She wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality
which had impelled her to snub the elder Calton, and rebelled against
it.It was quite warm; she had been walking a little faster than her usual
deliberate gait, and checked herself, halting in the warm breath of the
syringas.Here she heard her name called in a voice that she recognized,
but in tones so faint and subdued that it seemed to her part of her
thoughts.She turned quickly and beheld Chris Calton a few feet
from her, panting, partly from running and partly from some nervous
embarrassment.His handsome but weak mouth was expanded in an
apologetic smile; his blue eyes shone with a kind of youthful appeal so
inconsistent with his long brown mustache and broad shoulders that she
was divided between a laugh and serious concern."I saw you--go into the wood--but I lost you," he said, breathing
quickly, "and then when I did see you again--you were walking so fast
I had to run after you.I wanted--to speak--to you--if you'll let me.I
won't detain you--I can walk your way."Miss Trotter was a little softened, but not so much as to help him out
with his explanation.She drew her neat skirts aside, and made way for
him on the path beside her."You see," he went on nervously, taking long strides to her shorter
ones, and occasionally changing sides in his embarrassment, "my brother
Jim has been talking to you about my engagement to Frida, and trying to
put you against her and me.He said as much to me, and added you half
promised to help him!But I didn't believe him--Miss Trotter!--I know
you wouldn't do it--you haven't got it in your heart to hurt a poor
girl!He says he has every confidence in you--that you're worth a dozen
such girls as she is, and that I'm a big fool or I'd see it.I don't
say you're not all he says, Miss Trotter; but I'm not such a fool as he
thinks, for I know your GOODNESS too.I know how you tended me when
I was ill, and how you sent Frida to comfort me.You know, too,--for
you're a woman yourself,--that all you could say, or anybody could,
wouldn't separate two people who loved each other."Miss Trotter for the first time felt embarrassed, and this made her a
little angry."I don't think I gave your brother any right to speak
for me or of me in this matter," she said icily; "and if you are quite
satisfied, as you say you are, of your own affection and Frida's, I do
not see why you should care for anybody'sinterference.""Now you are angry with me," he said in a doleful voice which at any
other time would have excited her mirth; "and I've just done it.Oh,
Miss Trotter, don't!I didn't mean to say your talk
was no good.I didn't mean to say you couldn't help us.He reached out his hand, grasped her slim fingers in his own, and
pressed them, holding them and even arresting her passage.The act was
without familiarity or boldness, and she felt that to snatch her hand
away would be an imputation of that meaning, instead of the boyish
impulse that prompted it.She gently withdrew her hand as if to continue
her walk, and said, with a smile:--

"Then you confess you need help--in what way?"Was
it possible that this common, ignorant girl was playing and trifling
with her golden opportunity?"Then you are not quite sure of her?""She's so high spirited, you know," he said humbly, "and so attractive,
and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things
of her,--well!"--he threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless
despair--"there's no knowing what she might do."Miss Trotter's obvious thought was that Frida knew on which side her
bread was buttered; but remembering that the proprietor was a widower,
it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on
both sides.Her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened
at this suggestion, and there was a hardening of her face as she said,
"Well, if YOU can't trust her, perhaps your brother may be right.""I don't say that, Miss Trotter," said Chris pleadingly, yet with a
slight wincing at her words; "YOU could convince her, if you would only
try.Only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself.Miss Trotter, I'll leave it all to you--there!If you will only
help me, I will promise not to see her--not to go near her again--until
you have talked with her.Even my brother would not object
to that.And if he has every confidence in you, I'm showing you I've
more--don't you see?Come, now, promise--won't you, dear Miss Trotter?"He again took her hand, and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim
fingers.Indeed, it seemed to
her, in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy, as if a hand
had been put into her loveless past, grasping and seeking hers in its
loneliness.None of her school friends had ever appealed to her like
this simple, weak, and loving young man.Perhaps it was because they
were of her own sex, and she distrusted them.Nevertheless, this momentary weakness did not disturb her good common
sense.She looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then said, with a
faint smile, "Perhaps she does not trust YOU.He felt himself reddening with a strange embarrassment.It was not so
much the question that disturbed him as the eyes of Miss Trotter; eyes
that he had never before noticed as being so beautiful in their color,
clearness, and half tender insight.He dropped her hand with a new-found
timidity, and yet with a feeling that he would like to hold it longer."I mean," she said, stopping short in the trail at a point where a
fringe of almost impenetrable "buckeyes" marked the extreme edge of the
woods,--"I mean that you are still very young, and as Frida is
nearly your own age,"--she could not resist this peculiarly feminine
innuendo,--"she may doubt your ability to marry her in the face of
opposition; she may even think my interference is a proof of it; but,"
she added quickly, to relieve his embarrassment and a certain abstracted
look with which he was beginning to regard her, "I will speak to her,
and," she concluded playfully, "you must take the consequences."He said "Thank you," but not so earnestly as his previous appeal might
have suggested, and with the same awkward abstraction in his eyes.Miss
Trotter did not notice it, as her own eyes were at that moment fixed
upon a point on the trail a few rods away."Look," she said in a lower
voice, "I may have the opportunity now for there is Frida herself
passing."It was indeed the
young girl walking leisurely ahead of them.There was no mistaking
the smart pink calico gown in which Frida was wont to array her rather
generous figure, nor the long yellow braids that hung Marguerite-wise
down her back.With the consciousness of good looks which she always
carried, there was, in spite of her affected ease, a slight furtiveness
in the occasional swift turn of her head, as if evading or seeking
observation."I will overtake her and speak to her now," continued Miss Trotter."I
may not have so good a chance again to see her alone.You can wait here
for my return, if you like."he stammered, with a
faint, tentative smile."Perhaps--don't you think?--I had better go
first and tell her you want to see her.You see,
she might"--He stopped."It was part of your promise, you know, that you
were NOT to see her again until I had spoken.She has just gone into the
grove."Without another word the young man turned away, and she presently saw
him walking toward the pine grove into which Frida had disappeared.Then
she cleared a space among the matted moss and chickweed, and, gathering
her skirts about her, sat down to wait.The unwonted attitude, the
whole situation, and the part that she seemed destined to take in this
sentimental comedy affected her like some quaint child's play out of her
lost youth, and she smiled, albeit with a little heightening of color
and lively brightening of her eyes.Indeed, as she sat there listlessly
probing the roots of the mosses with the point of her parasol, the
casual passer-by might have taken herself for the heroine of some love
tryst.She had a faint consciousness of this as she glanced to the right
and left, wondering what any one from the hotel who saw her would think
of her sylvan rendezvous; and as the recollection of Chris kissing her
hand suddenly came back to her, her smile became a nervous laugh, and
she found herself actually blushing!He
was walking directly towards her with slow, determined steps, quite
different from his previous nervous agitation, and as he drew nearer she
saw with some concern an equally strange change in his appearance: his
colorful face was pale, his eyes fixed, and he looked ten years older."I came back to tell you," he said, in a voice from which all trace of
his former agitation had passed, "that I relieve you of your promise.It
won't be necessary for you to see--Frida.I thank you all the same, Miss
Trotter," he said, avoiding her eyes with a slight return to his boyish
manner."It was kind of you to promise to undertake a foolish errand for
me, and to wait here, and the best thing I can do is to take myself off
now and keep you no longer.Sometime I may tell
you, but not now."asked Miss Trotter quickly, premising Frida's
refusal from his face.He hesitated a moment, then he said gravely, "Yes.Don't ask me any
more, Miss Trotter, please.He paused, and then, with a
slight, uneasy glance toward the pine grove, "Don't let me keep you
waiting here any longer."He took her hand, held it lightly for a
moment, and said, "Go, now."Miss Trotter, slightly bewildered and unsatisfied, nevertheless passed
obediently out into the trail.He gazed after her for a moment, and
then turned and began rapidly to ascend the <DW72> where he had first
overtaken her, and was soon out of sight.Miss Trotter continued her way
home; but when she had reached the confines of the wood she turned, as
if taking some sudden resolution, and began slowly to retrace her steps
in the direction of the pine grove.What she expected to see there,
possibly she could not have explained; what she actually saw after a
moment's waiting were the figures of Frida and Mr.Her respected employer wore an air of somewhat ostentatious
importance mingled with rustic gallantry.Frida's manner was also
conscious with gratified vanity; and although they believed themselves
alone, her voice was already pitched into a high key of nervous
affectation, indicative of the peasant.But there was nothing to suggest
that Chris had disturbed them in their privacy and confidences.Yet he
had evidently seen enough to satisfy himself of her faithlessness.Miss Trotter waited only until they had well preceded her, and then took
a shorter cut home.She was quite prepared that evening for an interview
which Mr.She found him awkward and embarrassed in her
cool, self-possessed presence.He said he deemed it his duty to inform
her of his approaching marriage with Miss Jansen; but it was because he
wished distinctly to assure her that it would make no difference in Miss
Trotter's position in the hotel, except to promote her to the entire
control of the establishment.He was to be married in San Francisco at
once, and he and his wife were to go abroad for a year or two; indeed,
he contemplated eventually retiring from business.Bilson
was uneasily conscious during this interview that he had once paid
attentions to Miss Trotter, which she had ignored, she never betrayed
the least recollection of it.She thanked him for his confidence and
wished him happiness.Sudden as was this good fortune to Miss Trotter, an independence she
had so often deservedly looked forward to, she was, nevertheless,
keenly alive to the fact that she had attained it partly through Chris's
disappointment and unhappiness.Her sane mind taught her that it was
better for him; that he had been saved an ill-assorted marriage; that
the girl had virtually rejected him for Bilson before he had asked
her mediation that morning.Yet these reasons failed to satisfy her
feelings.It seemed cruel to her that the interest which she had
suddenly taken in poor Chris should end so ironically in disaster to
her sentiment and success to her material prosperity.She thought of his
boyish appeal to her; of what must have been his utter discomfiture in
the discovery of Frida's relations to Mr.Bilson that afternoon, but
more particularly of the singular change it had effected in him.How
nobly and gently he had taken his loss!How much more like a man he
looked in his defeat than in his passion!The element of respect which
had been wanting in her previous interest in him was now present in her
thoughts.It prevented her seeking him with perfunctory sympathy and
worldly counsel; it made her feel strangely and unaccountably shy of any
other expression.Bilson evidently desired to avoid local gossip until after his
marriage, he had enjoined secrecy upon her, and she was also debarred
from any news of Chris through his brother, who, had he known of Frida's
engagement, would have naturally come to her for explanation.It also
convinced her that Chris himself had not revealed anything to his
brother.III

When the news of the marriage reached Buckeye Hill, it did not, however,
make much scandal, owing, possibly, to the scant number of the sex
who are apt to disseminate it, and to many the name of Miss Jansen was
unknown.Bilson would be absent for a year,
and that the superior control of the Summit Hotel would devolve upon
Miss Trotter, DID, however, create a stir in that practical business
community.Every one knew
that to Miss Trotter's tact and intellect the success of the hotel had
been mainly due.Possibly, the satisfaction of Buckeye Hill was due to
something else.Slowly and insensibly Miss Trotter had achieved a social
distinction; the wives and daughters of the banker, the lawyer, and the
pastor had made much of her, and now, as an independent woman of means,
she stood first in the district.Guests deemed it an honor to have a
personal interview with her.The governor of the State and the Supreme
Court judges treated her like a private hostess; middle-aged Miss
Trotter was considered as eligible a match as the proudest heiress
in California.The old romantic fiction of her past was revived
again,--they had known she was a "real lady" from the first!She
received these attentions, as became her sane intellect and cool
temperament, without pride, affectation, or hesitation.Only her dark
eyes brightened on the day when Mr.Bilson's marriage was made known,
and she was called upon by James Calton."I did you a great injustice," he said, with a smile."I don't understand you," she replied a little coldly."Why, this woman and her marriage," he said; "you must have known
something of it all the time, and perhaps helped it along to save
Chris.""You are mistaken," returned Miss Trotter truthfully."Then I have wronged you still more," he said briskly, "for I thought at
first that you were inclined to help Chris in his foolishness.Now I see
it was your persuasions that changed him.""Let me tell you once for all, Mr.Calton," she returned with an
impulsive heat which she regretted, "that I did not interfere in any way
with your brother's suit.He spoke to me of it, and I promised to see
Frida, but he afterwards asked me not to.Calton, "WHATEVER you did, it was most efficacious,
and you did it so graciously and tactfully that it has not altered
his high opinion of you, if, indeed, he hasn't really transferred his
affections to you."Luckily Miss Trotter had her face turned from him at the beginning of
the sentence, or he would have noticed the quick flush that suddenly
came to her cheek and eyes.Yet for an instant this calm, collected
woman trembled, not at what Mr.Calton might have noticed, but at what
SHE had noticed in HERSELF.Calton, construing her silence and
averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech, continued
hurriedly:--

"I mean, don't you see, that I believe no other woman could have
influenced my brother as you have.""You mean, I think, that he has taken his broken heart very lightly,"
said Miss Trotter, with a bitter little laugh, so unlike herself that
Mr.He's regularly cut up, you
know!More like a gloomy crank than
the easy fool he used to be," he went on, with brotherly directness."It
wouldn't be a bad thing, you know, if you could manage to see him, Miss
Trotter!In fact, as he's off his feed, and has some trouble with his
arm again, owing to all this, I reckon, I've been thinking of advising
him to come up to the hotel once more till he's better.So long as SHE'S
gone it would be all right, you know!"By this time Miss Trotter was herself again.She reasoned, or thought
she did, that this was a question of the business of the hotel, and
it was clearly her duty to assent to Chris's coming.The strange yet
pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the thought she ignored
completely.Luckily, she was so much shocked by the change in
his appearance that it left no room for any other embarrassment in the
meeting.His face had lost its fresh color and round outline; the lines
of his mouth were drawn with pain and accented by his drooping mustache;
his eyes, which had sought hers with a singular seriousness, no longer
wore the look of sympathetic appeal which had once so exasperated her,
but were filled with an older experience.Indeed, he seemed to have
approximated so near to her own age that, by one of those paradoxes of
the emotions, she felt herself much younger, and in smile and eye showed
it; at which he  faintly.But she kept her sympathy and inquiries
limited to his physical health, and made no allusion to his past
experiences; indeed, ignoring any connection between the two.He had
been shockingly careless in his convalescence, had had a relapse in
consequence, and deserved a good scolding!His relapse was a reflection
upon the efficacy of the hotel as a perfect cure!She should treat him
more severely now, and allow him no indulgences!I do not know that
Miss Trotter intended anything covert, but their eyes met and he 
again.Ignoring this also, and promising to look after him occasionally,
she quietly withdrew.But about this time it was noticed that a change took place in Miss
Trotter.Always scrupulously correct, and even severe in her dress, she
allowed herself certain privileges of color, style, and material.She,
who had always affected dark shades and stiff white cuffs and collars,
came out in delicate tints and laces, which lent a brilliancy to her
dark eyes and short crisp black curls, slightly tinged with gray.One warm summer evening she startled every one by appearing in white,
possibly a reminiscence of her youth at the Vermont academy.The
masculine guests thought it pretty and attractive; even the women
forgave her what they believed a natural expression of her prosperity
and new condition, but regretted a taste so inconsistent with her age.For all that, Miss Trotter had never looked so charming, and the faint
autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer.One evening she found Chris so much better that he was sitting on
the balcony, but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to
overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask
him to come into her own little drawing-room, ostensibly to avoid the
cool night air.It was the former "card-room" of the hotel, but now
fitted with feminine taste and prettiness.She arranged a seat for him
on the sofa, which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness, the
last vestige of his youth."It's very kind of you to invite me in here," he began bitterly, "when
you are so run after by every one, and to leave Judge Fletcher just
now to talk to me, but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a
fool!""I thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on
the balcony, and I think Judge Fletcher is old enough to take care of
himself," she returned, with the faintest touch of coquetry, and a smile
which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself
as anything else."And I'm a baby who can't," he said angrily.After a pause he burst out
abruptly: "Miss Trotter, will you answer me one question?""Did you know--that--woman was engaged to Bilson when I spoke to you in
the wood?"she answered quickly, but without the sharp resentment she had
shown at his brother's suggestion.Bilson told
me the same evening.""And I only knew it when news came of their marriage," he said bitterly."But you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the
wood," she responded."When I saw them together in the wood?"Miss Trotter was startled, and stopped short.Was it possible he had not
seen them together?She was shocked that she had spoken; but it was too
late to withdraw her words."Yes," she went on hurriedly, "I thought
that was why you came back to say that I was not to speak to her."He looked at her fixedly, and said slowly: "You thought that?I returned before I had reached the wood--because--because--I had
changed my mind!"I did not love
the girl--I never loved her--I was sick of my folly.Sick of deceiving
you and myself any longer.Now you know why I didn't go into the wood,
and why I didn't care where she was nor who was with her!""I don't understand," she said, lifting her clear eyes to his coldly."Of course you don't," he said bitterly.And when you do understand you will hate and despise me--if you do not
laugh at me for a conceited fool!Hear me out, Miss Trotter, for I am
speaking the truth to you now, if I never spoke it before.I never asked
the girl to marry me!I never said to HER half what I told to YOU, and
when I asked you to intercede with her, I never wanted you to do it--and
never expected you would.""May I ask WHY you did it then?"said Miss Trotter, with an acerbity
which she put on to hide a vague, tantalizing consciousness."You would not believe me if I told you, and you would hate me if you
did."He stopped, and, locking his fingers together, threw his hands
over the back of the sofa and leaned toward her."You never liked me,
Miss Trotter," he said more quietly; "not from the first!From the day
that I was brought to the hotel, when you came to see me, I could see
that you looked upon me as a foolish, petted boy.When I tried to catch
your eye, you looked at the doctor, and took your speech from him.And
yet I thought I had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were,
and whose sympathy I longed so much to have.You may not believe me, but
I thought you were a queen, for you were the first lady I had ever seen,
and you were so different from the other girls I knew, or the women who
had been kind to me.You may laugh, but it's the truth I'm telling you,
Miss Trotter!"He had relapsed completely into his old pleading, boyish way--it had
struck her even as he had pleaded to her for Frida!"I knew you didn't like me that day you came to change the bandages.Although every touch of your hands seemed to ease my pain, you did it so
coldly and precisely; and although I longed to keep you there with me,
you scarcely waited to take my thanks, but left me as if you had
only done your duty to a stranger.And worst of all," he went on more
bitterly, "the doctor knew it too--guessed how I felt toward you, and
laughed at me for my hopelessness!That made me desperate, and put me up
to act the fool.Yes, Miss Trotter; I thought it mighty clever
to appear to be in love with Frida, and to get him to ask to have her
attend me regularly.And when you simply consented, without a word or
thought about it and me, I knew I was nothing to you."Duchesne's
strange scrutiny of her, of her own mistake, which she now knew might
have been the truth--flashed across her confused consciousness in swift
corroboration of his words.It was a DOUBLE revelation to her; for what
else was the meaning of this subtle, insidious, benumbing sweetness that
was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast.She
felt she ought to listen no longer--to speak--to say something--to get
up--to turn and confront him coldly--but she was powerless.Her reason
told her that she had been the victim of a trick--that having deceived
her once, he might be doing so again; but she could not break the spell
that was upon her, nor did she want to.She must know the culmination of
this confession, whose preamble thrilled her so strangely."The girl was kind and sympathetic," he went on, "but I was not so great
a fool as not to know that she was a flirt and accustomed to attention.I suppose it was in my desperation that I told my brother, thinking he
would tell you, as he did.He would not tell me what you said to him,
except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that I was only
flirting with Frida.Then I resolved to speak with you myself--and I
did.I know it was a stupid, clumsy contrivance.It never seemed so
stupid before I spoke to you.It never seemed so wicked as when you
promised to help me, and your eyes shone on me for the first time with
kindness.And it never seemed so hopeless as when I found you touched
with my love for another.You wonder why I kept up this deceit until you
promised.Well, I had prepared the bitter cup myself--I thought I ought
to drink it to the dregs."She turned quietly, passionately, and, standing up, faced him with a
little cry.He rose too, and catching her hands in his, said, with a white face,
"Because I love you."*****

Half an hour later, when the under-housekeeper was summoned to receive
Miss Trotter's orders, she found that lady quietly writing at the table.Among the orders she received was the notification that Mr.Calton's
rooms would be vacated the next day.When the servant, who, like most of
her class, was devoted to the good-natured, good-looking, liberal Chris,
asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better, Miss
Trotter, with equal placidity, answered that it was his intention to put
himself under the care of a specialist in San Francisco, and that
she, Miss Trotter, fully approved of his course.She finished her
letter,--the servant noticed that it was addressed to Mr.Bilson at
Paris,--and, handing it to her, bade that it should be given to a groom,
with orders to ride over to the Summit post-office at once to catch the
last post.As the housekeeper turned to go, she again referred to the
departing guest."It seems such a pity, ma'am, that Mr.Calton couldn't
stay, as he always said you did him so much good."But when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh,
and then, dropping her handsome gray-streaked head in her slim hands,
cried like a girl--or, indeed, as she had never cried when a girl.Calton's departure became known the next day, some
lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor.Miss Trotter agreed with them, with the consoling suggestion that he
might return for a day or two.He did return for a day; it was thought
that the change to San Francisco had greatly benefited him, though some
believed he would be an invalid all his life.Meantime Miss Trotter attended regularly to her duties, with the
difference, perhaps, that she became daily more socially popular and
perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine
guests.It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a
serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand.When, three months later,
some excitement was caused by the intelligence that Mr.Bilson was
returning to take charge of his hotel, owing to the resignation of Miss
Trotter, who needed a complete change, everybody knew what that meant.A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs.Boompointer;
others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim
finger.Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither, and by the time Mr.Bilson had returned she had taken her holiday, and the Summit House knew
her no more.Three years later, and at a foreign Spa, thousands of miles distant from
the scene of her former triumphs, Miss Trotter reappeared as a handsome,
stately, gray-haired stranger, whose aristocratic bearing deeply
impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival, and
believed her to be a grand duchess at the least.They were still
more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the
well-known Baroness X., and afterwards engaged in a very confidential
conversation with that lady.But they would have been still more
surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation."I am afraid you will find the Spa very empty just now," said the
baroness critically."But there are a few of your compatriots here,
however, and they are always amusing.You see that somewhat faded blonde
sitting quite alone in that arbor?That is her position day after day,
while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women
here.Quite the opposite experience one has of American women, where
it's all the other way, is it not?And there is an odd story about her
which may account for, if it does not excuse, her husband's neglect.They're very rich, but they say she was originally a mere servant in a
hotel.""You forget that I told you I was once only a housekeeper in one," said
Miss Trotter, smiling.I mean that this woman was a mere peasant, and frightfully
ignorant at that!"Miss Trotter put up her eyeglass, and, after a moment's scrutiny,
said gently, "I think you are a little severe.That was the name of her FIRST
husband.I am told she was a widow who married again--quite a
fascinating young man, and evidently her superior--that is what is so
funny.said Miss Trotter after a pause, in
a still gentler voice.He has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to
the Schwartzberg.You will find HER very stupid,
but HE is very jolly, though a little spoiled by women.Miss Trotter smiled, and presently turned the subject.But the baroness
was greatly disappointed to find the next day that an unexpected
telegram had obliged Miss Trotter to leave the Spa without meeting the
Caltons."Nobody must know that, mate," he ses."I must go
into hiding for as long as I can--as long as my money lasts; I've only
got six pounds left.""That'll last a long time if you're careful," ses Ginger."I want a lot more," ses Bill."I want you to take this silver ring as a
keepsake, Ginger.If I 'ad another six pounds or so I should feel much
safer.'Ow much 'ave you got, Ginger?""Not much," ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead."Lend it to me, mate," ses Bill, stretching out his 'and.Ah, I wish I was you; I'd be as 'appy as 'appy if I
hadn't got a penny.""I'm very sorry, Bill," ses Ginger, trying to smile, "but I've already
promised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening.A promise is a
promise, else I'd lend it to you with pleasure.""Would you let me be 'ung for the sake of a few pounds, Ginger?"ses
Bill, looking at 'im reproach-fully."I'm a desprit man, Ginger, and I
must 'ave that money."Afore pore Ginger could move he suddenly clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth
and flung 'im on the bed.Ginger was like a child in 'is hands, although
he struggled like a madman, and in five minutes 'e was laying there with
a towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord
off of Sam's chest."I'm very sorry, Ginger," ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds
out of Ginger's pocket."I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.If you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as
I've done."He lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.Ginger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead."Eight and six is fifteen," ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody
coming up the stairs.Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came
into the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling
'is 'ead from side to side."Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?""He's all right," ses Bill; "just a bit of a 'eadache."Peter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and
saw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him."I 'ad to do it, Peter," ses Bill."I wanted some more money to escape
with, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.I 'aven't got as much as I want
now.You just came in in the nick of time.Another minute and you'd ha'
missed me."Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill," ses Peter Russet, turning pale,
"but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some
from Ginger.""You see 'ow it is, Bill," ses Peter, edging back toward the door; "three
men laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got.""Well, I can't rob you, then," ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im."Whoever's money this is," he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's
pocket, "it can't be yours.Now, if you make another sound I'll knock
your 'ead off afore I tie you up.""Don't tie me up, Bill," ses Peter, struggling."I can't trust you," ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and
taking up the other towel; "turn round."Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im
'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying
both the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping."Mind, I've only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;
"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.If either of
you 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my
back to 'elp you.And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
talk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.The worst of it was
they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged
Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He
sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill
carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
afore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten
minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
that bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
to dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.All 'e did know was
that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and
went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
yourselves like that?'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
see wot was the matter with 'em.Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage."You wait till I
get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.The idea o' leaving us
like this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath."And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
you."Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the
fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
it.He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint."That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
bedclothes over your 'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
it's all about."Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
prevented it.He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
sorrow it caused their friends.Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting
Bill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.Arter
wot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.As soon
as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
never set eyes on 'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W.But the oaks, the early
oracles, [633] used to bear acorns; these, and the grass of the shooting
sod, were the food of men.Ceres was the first to teach the seed to
swell in the fields, and with the sickle did she cut her coloured locks;
she first forced the bulls to place their necks beneath the yoke; and
she with crooked tooth turned up the fallow ground.Can any one believe
that she takes delight in the tears of lovers, and is duly propitiated
with misery and single-blessedness?Nor yet (although she loves the
fruitful fields) is she a coy one; nor lias she a breast devoid of
love.The Cretans shall be my witnesses; and the Cretans do not feign
everything; the Cretans, a nation proud of having nurtured Jove.[634]
There, he who rules the starry citadel of the world, a little child,
drank milk with tender lips.There is full confidence in the witness;
by its foster-child the witness is recommended I think that Ceres will
confess her frailties, so well known.The Goddess had beheld Iasius [635] at the foot of Cretan Ida, as he
pierced the backs of the wild beasts with unerring hand.She beheld, and
when her tender marrow caught the flame; on the one side Shame, on the
other Love, inflamed her.Shame was conquered by Love; you might see the
furrows lying dry, and the crops coming up with a very small proportion
of their wheat.[636] When the mattocks stoutly wielded had turned up
the land, and the crooked plough had broken the hard earth, and the
seed had fallen equally scattered over the wide fields; the hopes of the
deceived husbandman were vain.The Goddess, the guardian of corn, was lingering in the lofty woods;
the wreaths of com had fallen from her flowing locks.Crete alone
was fertile in its fruitful year; all places, whither the Goddess had
betaken herself, were one continued harvest.Ida, the locality itself
for groves, grew white with corn, and the wild boar cropped the ears
in the woods.The law-giving Minos [637] wished for himself many like
years; he wished that the love of Ceres might prove lasting.Whereas, yellow-haired Goddess, single-blessedness would have been sad
to thee; this am I now compelled by thy rites to endure.Why should I
be sad, when thy daughter has been found again by thee, and rules over
realms, only less than Juno in rank?This festive day calls for both
Venus, and songs, and wine.These gifts is it fitting to bear to the
ruling Gods._He tells his mistress that he cannot help loving her._

|Much and long time have I suffered; by your faults is my patience
overcome.Depart from my wearied breast, disgraceful Love.In truth I
have now liberated myself, and I have burst my chains; and I am ashamed
to have borne what it shamed me not to endure.I have conquered; and
Love subdued I have trodden under foot; late have the horns [638] come
upon my head.Have patience, and endure, [639] this pain will one day
avail thee; often has the bitter potion given refreshment to the sick.And could I then endure, repulsed so oft from thy doors, to lay a
free-born body upon the hard ground?[640] And did I then, like a slave,
keep watch before thy street door, for some stranger I know not whom,
that you were holding in your embrace?And did I behold it, when the
wearied paramour came out of your door, carrying off his jaded and
exhausted sides?Still, this is more endurable than the fact that I was
beheld by him; [641] may that disgrace be the lot of my foes.When have I not kept close fastened to your side as you walked, [642]
myself your keeper, myself your husband, myself your companion?And,
celebrated by me forsooth, did you please the public: my passion was
the cause of passion in many.Why mention the base perjuries of your
perfidious tongue?and why the Gods forsworn [643] for my destruction?Why the silent nods of young men at banquets, [644] and words concealed
in signs arranged _beforehand?_ She was reported to me to be ill;
headlong and distracted I ran; I arrived; and, to my rival she was not
ill.[645]

Bearing these things, and others on which I am silent, I have oft
endured them; find another in my stead, who could put up with these
things.Now my ship, crowned with the votive chaplet, listens in safety
to the swelling waves of the ocean.Cease to lavish your blandishments
and the words which once availed; I am not a fool, as once I was.Love
on this side, Hatred on that, are struggling, and are dragging my tender
heart in opposite directions; but Love, I think, still gets the better.I will hate, [646] if I can; if not, reluctantly will I love; the bull
loves not his yoke; still, that which he hates he bears.I fly from treachery; your beauty, as I fly, brings me back; I abhor the
failings of your morals; your person I love.Thus, I can neither live
without you, nor yet with you; and I appear to be unacquainted with
my own wishes.I wish that either you were less handsome, or less
unprincipled.So beauteous a form does not suit morals so bad.Your
actions excite hatred; your beauty demands love.she is
more potent than her frailties.O pardon me, by the common rites of our bed, by all the Gods who so
often allow themselves to be deceived by you, and by your beauty, equal
to a great Divinity with me, and by your eyes, which have captivated
my own; whatever you shall be, ever shall you be mine; only do you make
choice whether you will wish me to wish as well to love you, or whether
I am to love you by compulsion.I would rather spread my sails and use
propitious gales; since, though I should refuse, I shall still be forced
to love._He complains that he has rendered his mistress so celebrated by his
verses, as to have thereby raised for himself many rivals._

|What day was that, on which, ye birds of no white hue, you sent forth
your ominous notes, ever sad to me in my loves?Or what star must I
consider to be the enemy of my destiny?Or what Deities am I to complain
of, as waging war against me?She, who but lately [647] was called my
own, whom I commenced alone to love, I fear that with many she must be
shared by me.'Tis so; by my genius
has she been made public.And justly; for why have I made proclamation
[648] of her charms?Through my fault has the fair been put up for sale.She pleases, and I the procurer; by my guidance is the lover introduced;
by my hands has her door been opened.Whether verses are of any use,
is matter of doubt; at all events, they have injured me; they have
been envious of my happiness.While Thebes, [649] while Troy, while the
exploits of Caesar existed; Corinna alone warmed my genius.Would that I
had meddled with verses against the will of the Muses; and that Phoebus
had deserted the work commenced!And yet, it is not the custom to listen
to Poets as witnesses; [650] I would have preferred all weight to be
wanting to my words.Through us, Scylla, who robbed her father of his white hair, bears the
raging dogs [651] beneath her thigh and loins.We have given wings to
the feet, serpents to the hair; the victorious descendant of Abas [652]
is borne upon the winged steed.We, too, have extended Tityus [653] over
the vast space, and have formed the three mouths for the dog bristling
-with snakes.We have described Enceladus, [654] hurling with his
thousand arms; and the heroes captivated by the voice of the two-shaped
damsels.[655] In the Ithacan bags [656] have we enclosed the winds of
Æolus; the treacherous Tantalus thirsts in the middle of the stream.Of
Niobe we have made the rock, of the damsel, the she-bear; the Cecropian
[657] bird sings of Odrysian Itys.Jupiter transforms himself, either
into a bird, or into gold [658] or, as a bull, with the virgin placed upon
him, he cleaves the waves.Why mention Proteus, and the Theban seed,
[659] the teeth?Why that there were bulls, which vomited flames from
their mouths?Why, charioteer, that thy sisters distil amber tears?[660] Why that they are now Goddesses of the sea, who once were ships?[661] Why that the light of day fled from the hellish banquet [662] of
Atreus?And why that the hard stones followed the lyre [663] as it was
struck?The fertile license of the Poets ranges over an immense space; and
it ties not its words to the accuracy of history.So, too, ought
my mistress to have been deemed to be falsely praised; now is your
credulity a mischief to me._He describes the Festival of Juno, as celebrated at Falisci, the native
place of his wife._

As my wife was born at Falisci, so fruitful in apples, we repaired to
the walls that were conquered, Camillus, by thee.[664] The priestesses
were preparing the chaste festival of Juno, with distinguished games,
and the heifer of the country.'Twas a great remuneration for my stay,
to be acquainted with the ceremony; although a path, difficult from the
ascent, leads the way thither.There stands a grove, ancient, and shaded
with numberless trees; look at it, you must confess that a Divinity
exists in the spot.An altar receives the prayers, and the votive
incense of the pious; an altar made without skill, by ancient hands.When, from this spot, the pipe has given the signal with its usual note,
the yearly procession moves along the covered paths.[665] Snow-white
heifers [666] are led, as the crowd applauds, which the Faliscan grass
has fed on its own plains; calves, too, not yet threatening with the
forehead to inspire fear; and the pig, a smaller victim, from its lowly
sty; the leader too, of the flock, with his horns bending back over his
hardy temples; the goat alone is odious to the Goddess queen.By her
betrayal, discovered in the lofty woods, [667] she is said to have
desisted from the flight she had commenced.Even now, by the boys,
is she aimed at as a mark; [668] and she is given, as a prize, to
the author of her wound.Where the Goddess is to come, the youths and
bashful girls sweep the roads before her, with garments [669] as they
lie.Their virgin hair is adorned with gold and gems; and the proud
mantle conceals their feet, bedecked with gold.After the Grecian manner
[670] of their ancestors, clad in white garments, they bear the sacred
vessels entrusted to them on their heads, placed beneath.The people
hold religious silence, [671] at the moment when the resplendent
procession comes up; and she herself follows after her priestesses.Argive is the appearance of the procession; Agamemnon slain, Halesus
[672] fled from both his crime and his father's wealth.And now, an
exile, having wandered over both land and sea, he erected lofty walls
with prospering hand.He taught his own Falisci the rites of Juno.May they be ever propitious to myself, may they be ever so to her own
people._He entreats his mistress, if she will not be constant, at least, to
conceal her intrigues from him._

|Beauteous since you are, I do not forbid your being frail; but let it
not be a matter of course, that wretched I should know it.Nor does any
severity of mine command you to be quite correct; but it only entreats
you to try to conceal the truth.She is not culpable, whoever can deny
that she has been culpable; and 'tis only the confession of error that
makes a woman disgraced.What madness is it to confess in light of day
what lies concealed in night?And what you do in secret, to say openly
that it is done?The strumpet about to entertain some obscure Roman,
first keeps out the public by fastening up the bar.And will you make
known your frailties to malicious report?And will you make proof of
your own criminality?May your mind be more sound, or, at least, may you
imitate the chaste; and although you are not, let me suppose that you
are chaste.What you do, still do the same; only deny that you do so;
and be not ashamed in public to speak the language of chastity.There is
the occasion which demands wantonness; sate it with every delight; far
thence be all modesty.Soon as you take your departure thence; away at
once with all lasciviousness, and leave your frailties in your chamber=

```Illic nec tunicam tibi sit posuisse rubori,

````Nec femori impositum sustinuisse femur:

```Illic purpureis condatur lingua labellis:

````Inque modos Venerem mille figuret amor;

```Illic nec voces, nec verba juvantia cessent;

````Spondaque lascivâ mobilitate tremat.=

With your garments put on looks that dread accusation; and let modesty
disavow improper pursuits.Deceive the public, deceive me, too; in my
ignorance, let me be mistaken, and allow me to enjoy my silly credulity.Why do I so often espy letters sent and received?Why one side and the
other [673] tumbled, of your couch?Why do I see your hair disarranged
more than happens in sleep, and your neck bearing the marks of teeth?The fading itself alone you do not bring before my eyes; if you hesitate
consulting your own reputation, still, spare me.My senses fail me, and
I am expiring, oft as you confess your failings; and the drops flow,
chilled throughout my limbs.Then do I love you; then, in vain, do I
hate what I am forced to love; 673* then I could wish myself to be dead,
but together with you.No enquiries, for my part, will I make, nor will I try to know what
you shall attempt to conceal; and to me it shall be the same as a false
charge.If, however, you shall be found detected in the midst of your
guilt, and if criminality shall be beheld by my eyes; what has been
plainly seen, do you deny to have been plainly seen; my own eyes shall
give way to your assertions.'Tis an easy conquest for you to vanquish
me, who desire to be vanquished.Let your tongue only be mindful to
say--"I did not do it!"since it is your lot to conquer with two words;
although not by the merit of your cause, still conquer through your
judge._He tells Venus that he now ceases to write Elegies._

|Seek a new Poet, mother of the tender Loves; here the extreme
turning-place is grazed [674] by my Elegies, which I, a foster-child of
the Pelignian fields, have composed; nor have my sportive lays disgraced
me._Me, I say, who_, if that is aught, am the heir to my rank, [675]
even through a long line of ancestors, and not lately made a Knight
in the hurly-burly of warfare.Mantua delights in Virgil, Verona in
Catullus; I shall be called the glory of the Pelignian race; which its
own liberties summon to glorious arms, [676] when trembling Rome dreaded
[677] the allied bands.And some stranger will say, as he looks on the
walls of the watery Sulmo, which occupy but a few acres of land, "Small
as you are, I will call you great, who were able to produce a Poet
so great."Beauteous boy, and thou, Amathusian parent [678] of the
beauteous boy, raise your golden standard from my fields.The horned
[679] Lyæus [680] has struck me with a thyrsus more potent; with mighty
steeds must a more extended plain be paced.Unwarlike Elegies, my
sportive [681] Muse, farewell; a work destined to survive long after I
am dead and gone.----





FOOTNOTES BOOK ONE:


[Footnote 001: Were five books.--Ver.From this it is clear, that
the first edition which Ovid gave to the public of his 'Amores' was
in five Books; but that on revising his work, he preferred (praetulit)
these three books to the former five.It is supposed that he rejected
many of those Elegies which were of too free a nature and were likely to
embroil him with the authorities, by reason of their licentiousness.][Footnote 002: Though it should.--Ver.Burmann has rightly observed,
that 'ut jam,' in this line, has exactly the force of 'quamvis,'
'although.'][Footnote 003: In serious numbers.--Ver.By the 'graves numeri,' he
means Heroic or Hexameter verses.It is supposed that he alludes to the
battle of the Giants or the Titans, on which subject he had begun to
write an heroic poem.In these lines Ovid seems to have had in view the
commencement of the first Ode of Anacreon.][Footnote 004: Suited to the measure.--Ver.The subject being of a
grave character, and, as such, suited to Heroic measure.][Footnote 005: Abstracted one foot.--Ver.He says that every second
line (as is the case in Heroic verse) had as many feet as the first,
namely, six : but that Cupid stole a foot from the Hexameter, and
reduced it to a Pentameter, whereby the Poet was forced to recur to the
Elegiac measure.][Footnote 008: Diminish my energies.--Ver.[Footnote 009: His quiver loosened.--Ver.The 'pharetra,' or
quiver, filled with arrows, was used by most of the nations that
excelled in archery, among whom were the Scythians, Persians, Lycians,
Thracians, and Cretans.It was made of leather, and was sometimes
adorned with gold or painting.It had a lid, and was suspended by a belt
from the right shoulder.Its usual position was on the left hip, and it
was thus worn by the Scythians and Egyptians.The Cretans, however,
wore it behind the back, and Diana, in her statues, is represented as so
doing.This must have been the method in which Cupid is intended in the
present instance to wear it, as he has to unloose the quiver before he
takes out the arrow.Some Commentators, however, would have'solutâ' to
refer simply to the act of opening the quiver.][Footnote 010: In six feet.--Ver.He says that he must henceforth
write in Hexameters and Pentameters, or, in other words, in the Elegiac
measure.][Footnote 011: My Muse.--Ver.The Muse addressed by him would be
Erato, under whose protection were those Poets whose theme was Love.He
bids her wreathe her hair with myrtle, because it was sacred to Venus;
while, on the other hand, laurels would be better adapted to the Heroic
Muse.The myrtle is said to love the moisture and coolness of the
sea-shore.][Footnote 014: Thy step-father.--Ver.He calls Mars the step-father
of Cupid, in consequence of his intrigue with Venus.][Footnote 015: Birds so yoked.--Ver.These are the doves which were
sacred to Venus and Cupid.By yoking them to the chariot of Mars, the
Poe* wishes to show the skill and power of Cupid.][Footnote 016: Io triumphe.--Ver.'Clamare triumphum,' means 'to
shout Io triumphe,' as the procession moves along.Lactantius speaks
of a poem called 'the Triumph of Cupid,' in which Jupiter and the other
Gods were represented as following him in the triumphal procession.][Footnote 017: Thyself with gold.--Ver.The poet Mosehus represents
Cupid as having wings of gold.][Footnote 018: The Gangetic land.--Ver.He alludes to the Indian
triumphs of Bacchus, which extended to the river Ganges.][Footnote 019: Thy kinsman Cæsar--Ver.Because Augustus, as the
adopted son of Julius Cæsar, was said to be descended from Venus,
through the line of Æneas.][Footnote 020: Shield the conquered.--Ver.Although Augustus
had many faults, it must be admitted that he was, like Julius, a most
merciful conqueror, and was generally averse to bloodshed.][Footnote 021: Founder of my family.See the Life of Ovid
prefixed to the Fasti; and the Second Book of the Tristia.][Footnote 022: Each of my parents.--Ver.From this it appears that
this Elegy was composed during the life-time of both of his parents, and
while, probably, he was still dependent on his father.][Footnote 023: No rover in affection.--Ver.'Desuitor,' literally
means 'one who leaps off.'The figure is derived from those equestrians
who rode upon several horses, or guided several chariots, passing from
the one to the other.This sport was very frequently exhibited in
the Roman Circus.Among the Romans, the 'desuitor' generally wore a
'pileus,' or cap of felt.The Numidian, Scythian, and Armenian soldiers,
were said to have been skilled in the same art.][Footnote 024: Of the bird.--Ver.[Footnote 026: The same banquet.--Ver.He says that they are about
to meet at 'coena,' at the house of a common friend.][Footnote 027: The last meal.--Ver.The 'coena' of the Romans is
usually translated by the word'supper'; but as being the chief meal of
the day, and being in general, (at least during the Augustan age) taken
at about three o'clock, it really corresponds to our 'dinner.'][Footnote 028: Warm the bosom of another.--Ver.As each guest while
reclining on the couch at the entertainment, mostly leaned on his left
elbow during the meal, and as two or more persons lay on the same couch,
the head of one person reached to the breast of him who lay above him,
and the lower person was said to lie on the bosom of the other.Among
the Romans, the usual number of persons occupying each couch was three.Sometimes, however, four occupied one couch; while, among the Greeks,
only two reclined upon it.In this instance, he describes the lady as
occupying the place below her husband, and consequently warming his
breast with her head.For a considerable time after the fashion of
reclining at meals had been introduced into Rome, the Roman ladies sat
at meals while the other sex was recumbent.Indeed, it was generally
considered more becoming for females to be seated, especially if it was
a party where many persons were present.Juvenal, however, represents a
bride as reclining at the marriage supper on the bosom of her husband.On the present occasion, it is not very likely that the ladies
were particular about the more rigid rules of etiquette.It must be
remembered that before lying down, the shoes or sandals were taken off.][Footnote 029: Damsel of Atrax.--Ver.He alludes to the marriage
of Hippodamia to Pirithous, and the battle between the Centaurs and the
Lapithæ, described in the Twelfth-.[Footnote 031: Do come first.--Ver.He hardly knows why he asks her
to do so, but still she must come before her husband; perhaps, that
he may have the pleasure of gazing upon her without the chance of
detection; the more especially as she would not recline till her husband
had arrived, and would, till then, probably be seated.][Footnote 032: Touch my foot.--Ver.This would show that she had
safely received his letter.][Footnote 033: My secret signs.--Ver.See the Note in this Volume,
to the 90th line of the 17th Epistle.][Footnote 034: By my eye-brows.--Ver.See the 82nd line of the 17th
Epistle.][Footnote 035: Traced in the wine.--Ver.See the 88th line of the
17th Epistle.][Footnote 036: Your blooming cheeks.--Ver.Probably by way of check
to his want of caution.][Footnote 037: Twisted on your fingers.--Ver.The Sabines were the
first to introduce the practice of wearing rings among the Romans.The
Romans generally wore one ring, at least, and mostly upon the fourth
finger of the left hand.Down to the latest period of the Republic, the
rings were mostly of iron, and answered the'purpose of a signet.The right of wearing a gold ring remained for several centuries the
exclusive privilege of Senators, Magistrates, and Knights.The emperors
were not very scrupulous on whom they conferred the privilege of wearing
the gold ring, and Severus and Aurelian gave the right to all Roman
soldiers.Vain persons who had the privilege, literally covered their
fingers with rings, so much so, that Quintilian thinks it necessary to
warn the orator not to have them above the middle joint of the fingers.The rings and the gems set in them, were often of extreme beauty and
value.From Juvenal and Martial we learn that the coxcombs of the
day had rings for both winter and summer wear.They were kept in
'dactyliothecæ,' or ring boxes, where they were ranged in a row.][Footnote 038: Who are in prayer.--Ver.It was the custom to
hold the altar while the suppliant was praying to the Deities; he here
directs her, while she is mentally uttering imprecations against her
husband, to fancy that the table is the altar, and to take hold of it
accordingly.][Footnote 039: If you are discreet.--Ver.Sapias' is put for'si
sapias,' 'if you are discreet,' 'if you would act sensibly.'][Footnote 041: Ask the servant.--Ver.This would be the slave,
whose office it was to mix the wine and water to the taste of the
guests.He was called [oivôxooç] by the Greeks, 'pincerna' by the
Romans.][Footnote 042: Which you have put down.--Ver.That is, which she
either puts upon the table, or gives back to the servant, when she has
drunk.][Footnote 043: Touched by his mouth.--Ver.This would appear to
refer to some choice morsel picked out of the husband's plate, which, as
a mark of attention, he might present to her.][Footnote 044: On his unsightly breast.--Ver.This, from her
position, if she reclined below her husband, she would be almost obliged
to do.][Footnote 045: So close at hand.--Ver.A breach of these
injunctions would imply either a very lax state of etiquette at the
Reman parties, or, what is more probable, that the present company was
not of a very select character.][Footnote 048: Beneath the cloth.--Ver.'Vestis' means a covering,
or clothing for anything, as for a couch, or for tapestry.Let us
charitably suppose it here to mean the table cloth; as the passage will
not admit of further examination, and has of necessity been somewhat
modified in the translation.][Footnote 049: The conscious covering.--Ver.The 'pallia,' here
mentioned, are clearly the coverlets of the couch which he has before
mentioned in the 41st line; and from this it is evident, that during the
repast the guests were covered with them.][Footnote 050: Add wine by stealth.--Ver.To make him fall asleep
the sooner]

[Footnote 051: 'Twas summer time.--Ver.In all hot climates it is
the custom to repose in the middle of the day.This the Spaniards call
the'siesta.'][Footnote 053: A part of the window.--Ver.On the 'fenestræ,' or
windows of the ancients, see the Notes to the Pontic Epistles, Book iii.5, and to the Metamorphoses, Book xiv.He means that
one leaf of the window was open, and one shut.][Footnote 054: Corinna.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of the Tristia,
Elegy x.GO, he says, 'Corinna, (so called by a fictitious name) the
subject of song through the whole city, had imparted a stimulus to my
geuius.'It has been supposed by some Commentators, that under this name
he meant Julia, either the daughter or the grand-daughter of the emperor
Augustus, but there seems really to be no ground for such a belief;
indeed, the daughter of Augustus had passed middle age, when Ovid was
still in boyhood.It is most probable that Corinna was ouly an ideal
personage, existing in the imagination of the Poet; and that he intended
the name to apply to his favourite mistress for the time being, as,
though he occasionally denies it, still, at other times, he admits that
his passion was of the roving kind.There are two females mentioned in
history of the name of Coriuna.One was a Theban poetess, who excelled
in Lyric composition, and was said to have vanquished Pindar himself in
a Lyric contest; while the other was a native of Thespiæ, in Bceotia.'The former, who was famous for both her personal charms and her mental
endowments, is supposed to have suggested the use of the name to Ovid.][Footnote 055: Clothed in a tunic.--Ver.'Tunica' was the name of
the under-garment with both sexes among the Romans.When the wearer was
out of doors, or away from home, it was fastened round the waist with a
belt or girdle, but when at home and wishing to be entirely at ease, it
was, as in the present instance, loose or ungirded.Both sexes usually
wore two tunics.In female dress, Varro seems to call the outer tunic
'subucula,' and the 'interior tunica' by the name also of 'indusium.'The outer tunic was also called'stola,' and, with the 'palla' completed
the female dress.The 'tunica interior,' or what is here called tunica,'
was a simple shift, and in early times had no sleeves.According to
Nonius, it fitted loosely on the body, and was not girded when the
'stola' or outer tunic was put on.Poor people, who could not afford
to purchase a 'toga,' wore the tunic alone; whence we find the lower
classes called by the name of 'tunicati.'][Footnote 056: Her flowing hair.--Ver.'Dividuis,' here means, that
her hair was scattered, flowing over her shoulders and not arranged on
the head in a knot.][Footnote 057: Semiramis.--Ver.Semiramis was the wife of Ninus,
king of Babylon, and was famous for her extreme beauty, and the talent
which she displayed as a ruler.She was also as unscrupulous in her
morals as the fair one whom the Poet is now describing.][Footnote 058: And Lais.--Ver.There are generally supposed to have
beén two famous courtesans of the name of Lais.The first was carried
captive, when a child, from Sicily, in the second year of the 91st
Olympiad, and being taken to Corinth, became famous throughout Greece
for her extreme beauty, and the high price she put upon her favours.Many of the richest and most learned men resorted to her, and became
smitten by her charms.The second Lais was the daughter of Alcibiades,
by his mistress, Timandra.When Demosthenes applied for a share of her
favours, she made the extravagant demand of ten thousand drachmae, upon
which, regaining his wisdom (which had certainly forsaken him for a
time) he said that he would not purchase repentance at so high a price.][Footnote 059: In its thinness.--Ver.Possibly it was made of Coan
cloth, if Corinna was as extravagant as she was vicious.][Footnote 060: The cruel fetter--Ver.Among the Romans, the porter
was frequently bound by a chain to his post, that he might not forsake
it.][Footnote 062: Watches of the keepers.--Ver.Properly, the 'excubiæ'
were the military watches that were kept on guard, either by night or
day, while the term 'vigiliæ,' was only applied to the watch by night.He here alludes to the watch kept by jealous men over their wives.][Footnote 063: Spectres that flit by night.--Ver.The dread of the
ghosts of the departed entered largely among the Roman superstitions.See an account of the Ceremony, in the Fifth Book of the Fasti, 1.422,
et seq., for driving the ghosts, or Lemures, from the house.][Footnote 064: Ready for the whip--Ver.See the Note to the 81st
line of the Epistle of De'ianira to Hercules.Ovid says, that he has
often pleaded for him to his mistress; indeed, the Roman ladies often
showed more cruelty to the slaves, both male and female, than the men
did to the male slaves.][Footnote 065: As you wish.--Ver.Of course it would be the
porter's wish that the night should pass quickly on, as he would be
relieved in the morning, and was probably forbidden to sleep during the
night.][Footnote 066: Hours of the night pass on.--Ver.This is an
intercalary line, being repeated after each seventh one.][Footnote 067: From the door-post.--Ver.The fastenings of the
Roman doors consisted of a bolt placed at the bottom of eacn 'foris,' or
wing of the door, which fell into a socket made in the sill.By way of
additional precaution, at night, the front door was secured by a bar of
wood or iron, here called'sera,' which ran across, and was inserted in
sockets on each side of the doorway.Hence it was necessary to remove or
strike away the bar, 'excutere seram,' before the door could be opened.][Footnote 068: Water of the slave.--Ver.Water was the principal
beverage of the Roman slaves, but they were allowed a small quantity of
wiue, which was increased on the Saturnalia.'Far,' or'spelt,' formed
their general sustenance, of which they received one 'libra' daily.Salt and oil were also allowed them, and sometimes fruit, but seldom
vegetables.Flesh meat seems not to have been given to them.][Footnote 069: About my temples.--Ver.'Circa mea tempora,'
literally, 'around my temples' This-expression is used, because it was
supposed that the vapours of excessive wine affect the brain.He says
that he has only taken a moderate quantity of wine, although the chaplet
falling from off his hair would seem to bespeak the contrary.][Footnote 073: Otherwise I myself!--Ver.Heinsius thinks that this
and the following line are spurious.][Footnote 074: Holding in my torch--Ver.Torches were usually
carried by the Romans, for their guidance after sunset, and were
generally made of wooden staves or twigs, bound by a rope around them,
in a spiral form, or else by circular bands at equal distances.The
inside of the torch was filled with flax, tow, or dead vegetable
matter, impregnated with pitch, wax, rosin, oil, or other inflammable
substances.][Footnote 075: Love and wine.--Ver.He seems, by this, to admit
that he has taken more than a moderate quantity of wine,'modicum
vinum,' as he says above.][Footnote 076: Anxieties of the prison.--Ver.He alludes to the
'ergastulum,' or prison for slaves, that was attached to most of the
Roman farms, whither the refractory slaves were sent from the City to
work in chains.It was mostly under ground, and, was lighted with narrow
windows, too high from the ground to be touched with the hand.Slaves who had displeased their masters were usually sent there for a
punishment, and those of uncouth habits were kept there.Plutarch says
that they were established, on the conquest of Italy, in consequence
of the number of foreign slaves imported for the cultivation of
the conquered territory.They were finally abolished by the Emperor
Hadrian.][Footnote 077: Bird is arousing.--Ver.The cock, whom the poets
universally consider as 'the harbinger of morn.'][Footnote 078: Equally slaves.--Ver.He called the doors, which
were bivalve or folding-doors, his 'conservæ,' or 'fellow' slaves,' from
the fact of their being obedient to the will of a slave.Plautuâ, in
the Asinaria, act.3, has a similar expression:--'Nolo ego
fores, conservas meas a te verberarier.''I won't have my door, my
fellow-slave, thumped by you.'][Footnote 080: Did not Ajax too.--Ver.Ajax Telamon, on being
refused the arms of Achilles, became mad, and slaughtered a flock
of sheep, fancying that they were the sons of Atreus, and his enemy
Ulysses.His shield, formed of seven ox hides, is celebrated by Homer.][Footnote 081: Mystic Goddesses.--Ver.Orestes avenged the death of
his father, Agamemnon, by slaying his own mother, Clytemnestra, together
with her paramour, Ægistheus.He also attempted to attack the Furies,
when they haunted him for the murder of his mother.][Footnote 082: Daughter of Schceneus.--Ver.Atalanta, the Arcadian,
or Mae-nalian, was the daughter of Iasius, and was famous for her skill
in the chase.Atalanta, the Boeotian, was the daughter of Schceneus,
and was renowned for her swiftness, and for the race in which she was
outstripped by Hippomenes.The Poet has here mistaken the one for the
other, calling the Arcadian one the daughter of Schoeneus.The story of
the Arcadian Atalanta is told in the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses,
and that of the daughter of Schceneus, at the end of the Tenth Book of
the same work.][Footnote 083: The Cretan damsel.--Ver.Ariadne, the daughter of
Minos, when deserted on the island of Naxos or Cea.]Cassandra being a priestess, would
wear the sacred fillets, 'vittse.'She was ravished by Ajax Oileus, in
the temple of Minerva.][Footnote 085: The humblest Roman.--Ver.It was not lawful to
strike a freeborn human citizen.'And as they
hound him with thongs, Paul said unto the Centurion that stood by, Is it
lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemncd?'This
privilege does not seem to have extended to Roman women of free birth.][Footnote 086: Strike a Goddess.--Ver.He alludes to the wound
inflicted by Diomedes upon Venus, while protecting her son Æneas.][Footnote 087: Her hurt cheeks--Ver.He implies by this, to his
disgrace which has made her cheeks black and blue by his violence.][Footnote 089: At the middle.--Ver.He says that he ought to have
been satisfied with tearing her tunic down to the waist, where the
girdle should have stopped short the rent; whereas, in all probability,
he had torn it from the top to the bottom.][Footnote 090: Her free-born cheeks.--Ver.It was a common practice
with many of the Romans, to tear and scratch their Slaves on the least
provocation.][Footnote 091: The Parian mountains.--Ver.The marble of Paros
was greatly esteemed for its extreme whiteness.Paros was one of the
Cyclades, situate about eighteen miles from the island of Delos.]'In statione,' was
originally a military phrase, signifying 'on guard'; from which It came
to be applied to any thing in its place or in proper order.][Footnote 094: Does she derive.--Ver.He says that her name,
'Dipsas,' is derived from reality, meaning thereby that she is so called
from the Greek verb [êtxpâui], 'to thirst'; because she was always
thirsty, and never rose sober in the morning.][Footnote 095: The charms of Ææa.--Ver.He alludes to the charms of
Circe and Medea.According to Eustathius, Ææa was a city of Colchis.][Footnote 096: Turns back to its source.--Ver.This the magicians of
ancient times generally professed to do.][Footnote 097: Spinning wheel.--Ver.'Rhombus,' means a
parallelogram with equal sides, but not having right angles, and hence,
from the resemblance, a spinning wheel, or winder.The 'licia' were the
cords or thrums of the old warp, or the threads of the old web to which
the threads of the new warp were joined.Here, however, the word seems
to mean the threads alone.The spinning-wheel was much used in magical
incantations, not only among the Romans, but among the people of
Northern and Western Europe.It is not improbable that the practice was
founded on the so-called threads of destiny, and it was the province of
the wizard, or sorceress, by his or her charms, to lengthen or shorten
those threads, according as their customers might desire.Indeed, in
some parts of Europe, at the present day, charms, in the shape of forms
of words, are said to exist, which have power over the human life at any
distance from the spot where they are uttered; a kind of superstition
which dispenses with the more cumbrous paraphernalia of the
spinning-wheel.Some Commentators think that the use of the 'licia'
implied that the minds of individuals were to be influenced at the will
of the enchanter, in the same way as the old thrums of the warp are
caught up and held fast by the new threads; this view, however, seems
to dispense with the province of the wheel in the incantation.See
the Second Book of the Fasti, 1.The old woman there mentioned
as performing the rites of the Goddess, Tacita, among her other
proceedings, 'binds the enchantea threads on the dark-coloured
spinning-wheel.'][Footnote 098: Venomous exudation.--Ver.This was the substance
called 'hippomanes,' which was said to flow from mares when in a
prurient state.Hesiod says, that 'hippomanes' was a herb which produced
madness in the horses that ate of it.Pliny, in his Eighth Book, says
that it is a poisonous excrescence of the size of a fig, and of a black
colour, which grows on the head of the mare, and which the foal at its
birth is in the habit of biting off, which, if it neglects to do, it is
not allowed by its mother to suck.This fictitious substance was said to
be especially used in philtres.][Footnote 099: Moon was empurpled.--Ver.If such a thing as a fog
ever exists in Italy, he may very possibly have seen the moon of a deep
red colour.][Footnote 101: That she, transformed.--Ver.'Versam,'
'transformed,' seems here to be a preferable reading to 'vivam,'
'alive.'Burmann, however, thinks that the'striges' were the ghosts of
dead sorcerers and wizards, and that the Poet means here, that Dipsas
had the power of transforming herself into a'strix' even while living,
and that consequently 'vivam' is the proper reading.The'strix' was
a fabulous bird of the owl kind, which was said to suck the blood of
children in the cradle.Seethe Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1.141, and the
Note to the passage.][Footnote 102: A double pupil, too.--Ver.The pupil, or apple
of the eye, is that part through which light is conveyed to the optic
nerve.Some persons, especially females, were said by the ancients to
have a double pupil, which constituted what was called 'the evil eye.'Pliny the Elder says, in his Seventh Book, that 'all women injure by
their glances, who have a double pupil.'The grammarian, Haephestion,
tells us, in his Fifth Book, that the wife of Candaulcs, king of Lydia,
had a double pupil.Heinsius suggests, that this was possibly the
case with the Ialysian Telchines, mentioned in the Seventh Book of the
Metamorphoses, 1.365, 'whose eyes corrupting all things by the very
looking upon them, Jupiter, utterly hating, thrust them beneath the
waves of his brother.'][Footnote 103: And their grandsires.--Ver.One hypercritical
Commentator here makes this remark: 'As though it were any more
difficult to summon forth from the tomb those who have long been dead,
than those who are iust deceased.'He forgot that Ovid had to make up
his line, and that 'antiquis proavos atavosque' made three good feet,
and two-thirds of another.][Footnote 105: The twofold doors.--Ver.The doors used by the
ancients were mostly bivalve, or folding doors.][Footnote 106: Mars in opposition.--Ver.She is dabbling here in
astrology, and the adverse and favourable aspects of the stars.We
are to suppose that she is the agent of the young man who has seen the
damsel, and she is telling her that the rising star of Venus is about to
bring her good luck.][Footnote 107: Makes it his care.--Ver.Burmann thinks that this
line, as it stands at present, is not pure Latin; and, indeed, 'curæ
habet,''makes it his care,' seems a very unusual mode of expression.He suggests another reading--'et, cultæ quod tibi défit, habet,' 'and
he possesses that which is wanting for your being well-dressed,' namely,
money.][Footnote 108: The damsel blushed.--Ver.He says that his mistress
blusned at the remark of the old hag, that the young man was worthy to
be purchased by her, if he had not been the first to make an offer.We
must suppose that here the Poet peeped through a chink of the door, as
he was on the other side, listening to the discourse; or he may have
reasonably guessed that she did so, from the remark made in the same
line by the old woman.][Footnote 109: Your eyes cast down.--Ver.The old woman seems to be
advising her to pretend modesty, by looking down on her lap, so as not
to give away even a look, until she has seen what is deposited there,
and then only to give gracious glances in proportion to her present.It
was the custom for the young simpletons who lavished their money on the
Roman courtesans, to place their presents in the lap or bosom.][Footnote 111: Sabine females.--Ver.The Sabines were noted for
their domestic virtues.The hag hints, that the chastity of the Sabine
women was only the result of their want of good breeding.'Tatio
régnante' seems to point to the good old times, in the same way as our
old songsters have it, 'When good king Arthur reigned.'Tatius
reigned jointly at Rome with Romulus.See the Fourteenth Book of the
Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 112: In foreign warfare.--Ver.She says, that they are
now in a more civilized state, than when they were fighting just without
the walls of Rome; now they are solely engaged in foreign conquests, and
Venus reigns in the city of the descendants of her son, Æneas.][Footnote 113: Dispel these frowns.--Ver.The damsel has, probably,
frowned here at her last remark, on which she tells her she must
learn to dispense with these frowns, and that when she dispels
them, 'excutit,' so many faults which might otherwise prove to her
disadvantage, will be well got rid of.][Footnote 114: Penelope used to try.--Ver.Penelope, in order that
she might escape the importunity of the suitors, proposed that they
should try to bend the bow of Ulysses, promising her hand to him who
should prove successful.The hag, however, says that, with all her
pretended chastity, Penelope only wanted to find out who was the most
stalwart man among her lovers, in order that she might choose him for a
husbaud.][Footnote 116: Graceful in his mantle.--Ver.The 'palla' was
especially worn by musicians.She is supposed to refer to the statue
of Apollo, which was erected on the Palatine Hill by Augustus; and
her design seems to be, to shew that poetry and riches are not so
incompatible as the girl may, from her lover's poverty, be led to
imagine.][Footnote 117: At a price for his person.--Ver.That is to say,
some rich slave who has bought his own liberty.As many of the Roman
slaves were skilful at various trades and handicrafts, and were probably
allowed the profits of their work after certain hours in the day, it
would be no uncommon thing for a slave, with his earnings, to purchase
his liberty.Some of the slaves practised as physicians, while others
followed the occupation of literary men.][Footnote 118: Rubbed with chalk.--Ver.It was the custom to mark
with chalk, 'gypsum,' the feet of such slaves as were newly imported for
sale.][Footnote 119: Busts about the halls.--Ver.Instead of
'quinquatria,' which is evidently a corrupt reading, 'circum atria' has
been adopted.She is advising the girl not to be led away by notions
of nobility, founded on the number of 'ceræ,' or waxen busts of their
ancestors, that adorned the 'atria,' or halls of her admirers.See the
Fasti, Book i. line 591, and the Note to the passage; also the Epistle
of Laodamia to Protesilaus, line 152.][Footnote 120: Nay, more, should.--Ver.'Quin' seems to be a
preferable reading to-'quid?'][Footnote 121: There will be Isis.--Ver.The Roman women celebrated
the festival of Isis for several successive days, and during that period
they care-fully abstained from the society of men.][Footnote 127: By your censure.--Ver.When she has offended she is
to pretend a counter grievance, so as to outweigh her faults.][Footnote 128: A deaf hearing.--Ver.Literally, 'deaf Godhead.'][Footnote 129: A crafty handmaid.--Ver.The comedies of Plautus and
Terence show the part which the intriguing slaves and handmaids acted on
such occasions.][Footnote 130: A little of many.--Ver.'Multos,' as suggested by
Heinsius, is preferable to'multi,' which does not suit the sense.][Footnote 131: Heap from the gleanings--Ver.'Stipula' here means
'gleanings.'She says, that each of the servants must ask for a little,
and those little sums put together will make a decent amount collected
from her lovers.No doubt her meaning is, that the mistress should
pocket the presents thus made to the slaves.][Footnote 132: With a cake.--Ver.The old woman tells how, when
she has exhausted all other excuses for getting a present, to have the
birth-day cake by her, and to pretend that it is her birth-day; in
order that her lover may take the hint, and present her with a gift.The
birth-day cake, according to Servius, was made of flour and honey; and
being set on tabic before the guests, the person whose birth-day it was,
ate the first slice, after which the others partook of it, and wished
him happiness and prosperity.Presents, too, were generally made on
birth-days.][Footnote 133: The Sacred Street."--Ver.The 'via sacra,'
or' Sacred Street, from the old Senate house at Rome towards the
Amphitheatre, and up the Capitoline hill.For the sale of all kinds of
luxuries, it seems to have had the same rank in Rome that Regent Street
holds in London.The procuress tells her, that if her admirer makes no
presents, she must turn the conversation to the 'Via Sacra;' of course,
asking him such questions as, What is to be bought there?What is the
price of such and such a thing?And then she is to say, that she is in
want of this or that, but unfortunately she has no money, &c.][Footnote 134: Conceal your thoughts.--Ver.This expression
resembles the famous one attributed to Machiavelli, that'speech was
made for the concealment of the thoughts.'][Footnote 134: Prove his ruin.--Ver.'Let your lips utter kind
things, but let it be your intention to ruin him outright by your
extravagance.'][Footnote 135: Grant thee both no home--Ver.The 'Lares,' being
the household Gods, 'nullos Lares,' implies 'no home.'][Footnote 136: Everlasting thirst.--Ver.In allusion to her
thirsty name; see the Note to the second line.]It is supposed that this Atticus was
the same person to whom Ovid addresses the Fourth and Seventh Pontic
Epistle in the Second Book.It certainly was not Pomponius Atticus, the
friend of Cicero, who died when the Poet was in his eleventh year.][Footnote 139: The years which."--Ver.The age for serving in the
Roman armies, was from the seventeenth up to the forty-sixth year.][Footnote 140: Of his general.--Ver.He alludes to the four
night-watches of the Roman army, which succeeded each other every three
hours.Each guard, or watch, consisted of four men, of whom one acted as
sentry, while the others were in readiness, in case of alarm.][Footnote 142: The othert doors.--Ver.From the writings of Terence
and Plautus, as well as those of Ovid, we find that the youths of Rome
were not very scrupulous about kicking down the door of an obdurate
mistress.][Footnote 143: Thracian Rhesits.--Ver.See the preceding Epistle of
Pénélope to Ulysses, and the speech of Ulysses in the Thirteenth Book of
the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 144: Cease to love.--Ver.It is hard to say whether the
word 'Desinat' means 'Let him leave off saying so,' or 'Let him cease to
love': perhaps the latter is the preferable mode of rendering it.][Footnote 146: The raving prophetess.--Ver.'Mænas' literally means
'a raving female,' from the Greek word paivopai, 'to be mad.'He alludes
to Cassandra when inspired with the prophetic spirit.][Footnote 147: At the forge.--Ver.When he was detected by means of
the iron net, as related in the Fourth Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 148: A lazy inactivity.--Ver.When persons wished to
be at ease in their leisure moments at home, they were in the habit of
loosening the girdle which fastened the tunic; from this circumstance,
the term 'dis-cinctus' is peculiarly applied to a state of indolence.][Footnote 149: Couch and the shade.--Ver.'Lectus et umbra' means
'lying in bed and reclining in the shade.'The shade of foliage would
have peculiar attractions in the cloudless climate of Italy, especially
for persons naturally inclined to be idle.]'Æra merere' has the same meaning
as'stipendum merere,' 'to earn the pay of a soldier,' whence it came to
signify 'to sene as a soldier.'The ancient accounts differ materially
as to the pay which the Roman soldiers received.][Footnote 151: The Eurotas.--Ver.The Eurotas was the river which
flowed past the walls of Sparta.[Footnote 152: Amymone.--Ver.She was one of the Danaides, and
was carrying water, when she was attacked by a Satyr, and rescued by
Neptune.See the Epistle of Hero to Leander, 1.131, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 153: Fold in his dress.--Ver.The'sinhs' of the 'toga,'
among the men, and of the 'palla,' among the women, which extended in
folds across the breast, was used as a pocket, in which they carried
money, purses, letters, and other articles.When the party was seated,
the'sinus' would almost correspond in meaning with our word 'lap.'][Footnote 154: Avaricious procurer.--Ver.'Leno' was a person who
kept a house for the purposes of prostitution, and who generally robbed
his victims of the profits of their unfortunate calling.This was called
'lenocinium,' and the trade was not forbidden, though the 'lenones' were
considered 'infames,' or 'disgraced,' and thereby lost certain political
rights.]Being probably the slave of the
'leno,' he would use force to make her comply with his commands.][Footnote 156: Hired dishonestly.--Ver.The evidence of witnesses
was taken by the Praetor, and was called 'jusjurandum in judicio,'
whereas the evidence of parties themselves was termed 'jusjurandum in
jure.'It was given on oath by such as the Praetor or other judge chose
to call, or as either party might propose for examination.]The 'area' here means the strong
box, or chest, in which the Romans were accustomed to place their money;
they were generally made of, or bound with, iron or other metal.][Footnote 158: Commissioned judge.--Ver.The 'judices selecti' were
the 'cen-tumviri,' a body of one hundred and five officers, whose duty
it was to assist the Praetor in questions where the right to property
was litigated.In the Second Book of the Tristia, 1.93, we are informed
that the Poet himself filled the office of a 'judex selectus.'][Footnote 159: That is purchased.--Ver.Among the Romans, the
'patroni' defended their 'clientes' gratuitously, and it would have been
deemed disgraceful for them to take a fee or present.][Footnote 160: He who hires.--Ver.The 'conductor' was properly the
person who hired the services, or the property of another, for a fixed
price.The word sometimes means 'a contractor,' or the person with
whom the bargain by the former party is made.See the public contract
mentioned in the Fasti, Book v.[Footnote 161: The Sabine bracelets.--Ver.He alludes to the fate
of the Vestal virgin Tarpeia.261, and Note;
also the Translation of the Metamorphoses, p.[Footnote 163: The son pierced.--Ver.Alcmæon killed his mother
Eriphyle, for having betrayed his father Amphiaraus.See the Second Book
of the Fasti, 1.43, and the Third Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep.[Footnote 164: A simple necklace.--Ver.See the Epistle of Deianira
to Hercules, and the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses 1.113, with the
Note to the passage.][Footnote 165: Soil of Alcinoiis.--Ver.The fertile gardens
of Alcinoiis, king of the Phæacians, are celebrated by Homer in the
Odyssey.][Footnote 166: The straggling locks.--Ver.The duty of dressing
the hair of the Roman ladies was divided among several slaves, who were
called by the general terms of 'cosmetæ,' and 'omatrices.'It was the
province of one to curl the hair with a hot iron, called 'calamistrum,'
which was hollow, and was heated in wood ashes by a slave who, from
'cinis,' 'ashes,' was called 'ciniflo.'The duty of the 'psecas' came
next, whose place it was to anoint the hair.Then came that of the
'ornatrix,' who parted the curls with a comb or bodkin; this seems to
have been the province of Napè.][Footnote 167: To be reckoned.--Ver.The Nymphs of the groves were
called [Footnote vanâtai ]; and perhaps from them Nape received her
name, as it is evidently of Greek origin.One of the dogs of Actæon is
called by the same name, in the Metamorphoses, Book iii.[Footnote 168: Giving the signale.--Ver.'Notis' may mean here,
either 'hints,]

'signs,''signals.'In Nizard's French translation it is
rendered'missives.'][Footnote 169: Carry these tablets.--Ver.On the wax tablets,
see the Note to the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.69, and the
Metamorphoses, Book ix.[Footnote 170: So well filled.--Ver.'Peraratas' literally means
'ploughed over'; which term is properly applied to the action of the
'stylus,' in ploughing through the wax upon the tablets.Suetonius
relates that Julius Caesar, when he was murdered in the Senate House,
pierced the arm af the assassin Cassius with his'stylus.'][Footnote 172: A long answer.--Ver.She is to write at once, on
having read his letter through.This she could do the more readily, as
she could use the same tablets, smoothing the wax with the broad end of
the 'graphium,' or'stylus.'][Footnote 175: Holding the pen.--Ver.'Graphium' was the Greek name
for the'stylus,' or pen used for writing on the wax tablets.It was
generally of iron or copper, but sometimes of gold.The case in which it
was kept was called 'graphiarium,' or 'graphiaria theca.'][Footnote 176: Of worthless maple.--Ver.He calls the wood of the
tablets 'vile,' in comparison with their great services to him: for,
according to Pliny, Book xvi.15, maple was the most valued wood
for tablets, next to 'citrus,' cedar, or citron wood.It was also more
useful than citron, because it could be cut into leaves, or laminae, of
a larger size than citron would admit of.][Footnote 178: Struck her foot.--Ver.This is mentioned as a bad
omen by Laodamia, in her Epistle to Protesilaüs, 1.So in the Tenth
Book of the Metamorphoses, in the shocking story of Cinyras and Myrrha;
Three times was she recalled by the presage of her foot stumbling.'][Footnote 180: The Corsican lee.--Ver.From Pliny, Book xvi., we
learn that the honey of Corsica was of a bitter taste, in consequence of
the box-trees and yews, with which the isle abounded, and which latter,
according to him, were poisonous.From Diodorus Siculus we learn that
there were many turpentine trees on the island; this would not tend to
improve the flavour of the honey.][Footnote 181: Dyed in vermilion.--Ver.'Minium,''red lead,'
or'vermilion,' was discovered by Callias, an Athenian, according to
Theophrastus.It was sometimes mixed with the wax used for tablets:
probably not the best, but that which was naturally of a bad colour.This censure of the tablets is a good illustration of the grapes being
sour.In the last Elegy, before he has received his repulse, he declares
the wax to be'splen-dida,' 'of brilliaut whiteness through bleaching;'
now, on the other hand, he finds, most ominously, that it is as red as
blood.][Footnote 182: Dreadful crosses.--Ver.See the First Book of the
Pontic Epistlea, Ep.[Footnote 183: The screech-owl.--Ver.'Strix' here means a
screech-owl; and not the fabulous bird referred to under that name, in
the Sixth Book of the Fasti, and the thirteenth line of the Eighth Elegy
of this Book.][Footnote 184: The prosy summons.--Ver.'Vadimonium legere'
probably means, 'to call a man on his bail' or'recognizances.'When the
Praetor had granted an action, the plaintiff required the defendant to
give security for his appearance on the day named.The defendant, on
finding a surety, was said 'vades dare,' or 'vadimonium facere': and the
'vas,' or surety, was said'spondere.'The plaintiff, if satisfied with
the surety, was said 'vadari reum,' 'to let the defendant go on his
sureties.']Some Commentators think that
the word 'cognitor' here means, the attorney, or procurator of the
plaintiff, who might, in his absence, carry on the cause for him.In
that case they would translate 'duro,''shameless,' or 'impudent.'But
another meaning of the word 'cognitor' is 'a judge,' or 'commissioner,'
and such seems to be the meaning here, in which case 'duras' will mean
'severe,' or'sour;' 'as,' according to one Commentator, 'judges are
wont to be.'Much better would they lie amid diaries and day-books, [186]
over which the avaricious huncks might lament his squandered substance.And have I then in reality as well as in name found you full of
duplicity?[187] The very number _of you_ was not one of good omen.What,
in my anger, ought I to pray, but that an old age of rottenness may
consume you, and that your wax may be white with nasty mould?][Footnote 186: And day-books.--Ver.Seneca, at the end of his 19th
Epistle, calls a Calendar by the name of 'Ephemeris,' while a day-book
is meant by the term as used by Ausonius.The word here seems to mean
a 'diary;' while 'tabula' is perhaps a 'day-book,' in which current
expenses are set down, and over which the miser weeps, as the record of
past extravagance.][Footnote 187: Full of duplicity.--Ver.The word 'duplex' means
either 'double,' or 'deceitful,' according to the context.He plays on
this twofold meaning, and says that double though they might be, still
truly deceitful they were; and that the two leaves of the tablets were
of no good omen to him.Two-leaved tablets were technically called
'diptycha.'][Footnote 189: Honour the shades.--Ver.'Parento' means 'to
celebrate the funeral obsequies of one's parents.'Both the Romans and
the Greeks were accustomed to visit the tombs of their relatives
at certain times, and to offer sacrifices, called 'inferiæ,' or
'parentalia.'The souls of the departed were regarded by the Romans as
Gods, and the oblations to them consisted of milk, wine, victims, or
wreaths of flowers.The Poet here refers to the birds which arose from
the funeral pile of Memnon, and wera said to revisit it annually.See
the Thirteenth Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 190: Moisture is cooling.--Ver.'Humor' seems to mean the
dew, or the dampness of the night, which would tend, in a hot climate,
to modify the sultriness of the atmosphere.One Commentator thinks that
the word means the humours of the brain.][Footnote 192: To their masters.--Ver.The schools at Rome were
mostly kept by manumitted slaves; and we learn from the Fasti, Book iii.829, that people were not very particular about paying them.][Footnote 193: The cruel stripes.--Ver.The punishment here
mentioned was generally inflicted on the hands of the Roman school-boys,
with a 'ferula,' or stalk of giant-fennel, as we learn from Juvenal,
Satire 1.]The business of the
'jurisconsultus' was to expound and give opinions on the law, much like
the chamber counsel of the present day.They were also known by the name
of 'juris periti,' or 'consulti' only.Cicero gives this definition of
the duty of a 'consultus.']'He is à person who has such a knowledge of the laws and customs which
prevail in a state, as to be able to advise, and secure a person in
his dealings.They advised their clients gratuitously, either in public
places, or at their own houses.They also drew up wills and contracts,
as in the present instance.][Footnote 195: To become bail.--Ver.This passage has given much
trouble to the Commentators, but it has been well explained by Burmann,
whose ideas on the subject are here adopted.The word'sponsum' has
been generally looked upon here as a noun substantive, whereas it is the
active supine of the verb'spondeo,' 'to become bail' or'security.'The
meaning then is, that some rise early, that they may go and become bail
for a friend, and thereby incur risk and inconvenience, through uttering
a single word,'spondeo,' 'I become security,' which was the formula
used.The obligation was coutracted orally, and for the purpose of
evidencing it, witnesses were necessary; for this reason the
undertaking was given, as in the present instance, in the presence of a
'jurisconsultus.'][Footnote 198: To the pleader.--Ver.'Causidicus' was the person
who pleads the cause of his client in court before the Prætor or other
judges.]Heinsius and other Commentators think
that this line and the next are spurious.The story of Cephalus
and Procris is related at the close of the Seventh Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 201: The Moon gave.--Ver.Ovid says that Diana sent the
sleep upon Endymion, whereas it was Jupiter who did so, as a punishment
for his passion for Juno; he alludes to the youthfulness of the favorite
of Diana, antithetically to the old age of Tithonus, the husband of
Aurora.][Footnote 202: Two nights together.--Ver.When he slept with
Acmena, under the form of her husband Amphion.][Footnote 203: Doctoring your hair.--Ver.Among the ancient Greeks,
black hair was the most frequent, but that of a blonde colour was most
valued.It was not uncommon with them to dye it when turning grey, so as
to make it a black or blonde colour, according to the requirement of the
case.Blonde hair was much esteemed by the Romans, and the ladies were
in the habit of washing their hair with a composition to make it of this
colour.This was called'spuma caustica,' or, 'caustic soap,' wich was
first used by the Gauls and Germans; from its name, it was probably the
substance which had been used inthe present instance.][Footnote 204: So far as ever.--Ver.By this he means as low as her
ancles.][Footnote 205: Afraid to dress.--Ver.He means to say, that it was
so fine that she did not dare to curl it, for fear of injuring it.][Footnote 206: Just like the veils.--Ver.Burmann thinks that
'fila,' 'threads,' is better here than'vela,' and that it is the
correct reading.The swarthy Seres here mentioned, were perhaps the
Chinese, who probably began to import their silks into Rome about this
period.The mode of producing silk does not seem to have been known to
Virgil, who speaks, in the Second Book of the Georgies, of the Seres
combing it off the leaves of trees.Pliny also, in his Sixth Book, gives
the same account.Ovid, however, seems to refer to silkworms under the
name of 'agrestes tineæ,' in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 208: Neither the bodkin.--Ver.This was the
'discerniculum,' a 'bodkin,' which was used in parting the hair.][Footnote 210: Bid the bodkin.--Ver.The 'acus' here mentioned, was
probably the 'discemicirium,' and not the 'crinale,' or hair-pin that
was worn in the hair; as the latter was worn when the hair was bound up
at the back of the head; whereas, judging from the length of the hair
of his mistress, she most probably wore it in ringlets.He says that
he never saw her snatch up the bodkin and stick it in the arm of the
'ornatrix.'][Footnote 211: Iron and the fire.--Ver.He alludes to the
unnecessary application of the curling-iron to hair which naturally
curled so well.][Footnote 212: The very locks instruct.--Ver.Because they
naturally assume as advantageous an appearance as the bodkin could
possibly give them, when arranged with the utmost skill.][Footnote 213: Dione is painted.--Ver.4,
mentions a painting, by Apelles, in which Venus was represented as
rising from the sea.It was placed, by Augustus, in the temple of Julius
Caesar; and the lower part having become decayed, no one could be found
of sufficient ability to repair it.][Footnote 214: Lay down the mirror.--Ver.The mirror was usually
held by the 'ornatrix,' while her mistress arranged her hair.][Footnote 215: Herbs of a rival.--Ver.No person would be more
likely than the 'pellex,' or concubine, to resort to charms and drugs,
for the purpose of destroying the good looks of the married woman whose
husband she wishes to retain.][Footnote 216: All bad omens.--Ver.So superstitious were the
Romans, that the very mention of death, or disease, was deemed ominous
of ill.][Footnote 217: Germany will be sending.--Ver 45.Germany having been
lately conquered by the arms of Augustus, he says that she must wear
false hair, taken from the German captives.It was the custom to cut
short the locks of the captives, and the German women were famed for the
beauty of their hair.][Footnote 218: Sygambrian girl.--Ver.The Sygambri were a people of
Ger many, living on the banks of the rivers Lippe and Weser.][Footnote 219: For that spot.--Ver.She carries a lock of the hair,
which had fallen off, in her bosom.][Footnote 221: My tongue for hire.--Ver.Although the 'patronus
pleaded the cause of the 'cliens,' without reward, still, by the use of
the word 'pros-tituisse,' Ovid implies that the services of the advocate
were often sold at a price.It must be remembered, that Ovid had been
educated for the Roman bar, which he had left in disgust.][Footnote 222: Mæonian bard.--Ver.Strabo says, that Homer was a
native of Smyrna, which was a city of Maeonia, a province of Phrygia.But Plutarch says, that he was called 'Maeonius,' from Maeon, a king of
Lydia, who adopted him as his son.][Footnote 223: Tenedos and Ida.--Ver.Tenedos, Ida, and Simois,
were the scenes of some portions of the Homeric narrative.The first was
near Troy, in sight of it, as Virgil says--'est in conspectu Tenedos.'][Footnote 224: The Ascræan, tool--Ver.Hesiod of Ascræa, in
Boeotia, wrote chieflv upon agricultural subjects.See the Pontic
Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 225: With its juices.--Ver.The'mustum' was the pure
jidcc of the grape before it was boiled down and became'sapa,'
or 'defrutum.'779, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 226: The son of Battus.--Ver.As to the poet Callimachus,
the son of Battus, see the Tristia, Book ii.[Footnote 227: To the tragic buskin.--Ver.On the 'cothurnus,' or
'buskin,' see the Tristia, Book ii.Sophocles was one of the most famous of the Athenian Tragedians.He is
supposed to have composed more than one hundred and twenty tragedies, of
which only seven are remaining.]Aratus was a Greek poet, a native of
Cilicia, in Asia Minor.He wrote some astronomical poems, of which one,
called 'Phænomena,' still exists.His style is condemned by Quintilian,
although it is here praised by Ovid.His 'Phænomena' was translated into
Latin by Cicero, Germanicus Caesar, and Sextus Avienus.][Footnote 229: The deceitful slave.--Ver.Although the plays of
Menander have perished, we can judge from Terence and Plautus, how well
he depicted the craftiness of the slave, the severity of the father, the
dishonesty of the procuress, and the wheedling ways of the courtesan.Four of the plays of Terence are translations from Menander.See the
Tristia, Book ii.[Footnote 230: Ennius.--Ver.Quintus Ennius was a Latin poet, a
Calabrian by birth.The
few fragments of his works that remain, show the ruggedness and uncouth
nature of his style.He wrote the Annals of Italy in heroic verse.]See the Second Book of the Tristia, 1.[Footnote 232: Of Varro.--Ver.He refers to Publius Terentius Varro
Attacinus, who wrote on the Argonautic expedition.See the Tristia, Book
ii.439, and the Pontic Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 233: Lucretius.--Ver.Titus Lucretius Carus is referred
to, whose noble poem on the Epicurean philosophy is still in existence
(translated in Bohn's Classical Library).261 and 426, and the Notes to those passages.][Footnote 234: Tityrus.--Ver.Under this name he alludes to Virgil,
who introduces himself under the name of Tityrus, in his first Eclogue,
See the Pontic Epistles, *Boek iv.[Footnote 235: So long as thou, Rome.--Ver.His prophecy has been
surpassed by the event.Rome is no longer the 'caput urbis,' but the
works of Virgil are still read by all civilized nations.][Footnote 236: Polished Tibullus.--Ver.Albius Tibullus was a Roman
poet of Equestrian rank, famous for the beauty of his compositions.He was born in the same year as Ovid, but died at an early age.Ovid
mentions him in the Tristia, Book ii.In the Third Book of the Amores, El.9,
will be found his Lament on the death of Tibullus.]Cornelius Gallus was a Roman poet of
considerable merit.See the Tristia, Book ii 1.445, and the Note to the
passage, and the Amores, Book iii.[Footnote 238: By the East.--Ver.Gallus was the Roman governor of
Egypt, which was an Eastern province of Rome.][Footnote 239: The golden Tagus.--Ver.Pliny and other authors
make mention of the golden sands of the Tagus, which flowed through the
province of Lusitania, now Portugal.][Footnote 240: The closing fire.--Ver.Pliny says that the ancient
Romans buried the dead; but in consequence of the bones being disturbed
by continual warfare, they adopted the system of burning them.]FOOTNOTES BOOK TWO:


[Footnote 301: The watery Peligni.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, 1.81, and the Fourth Book of the Tristia, 1. x. El.3, he
mentions Sulmo, a town of the Peligni, as the place of his birth.It was
noted for its many streams or rivulets.][Footnote 302: And Gyges.--Ver.This giant was more generally
called Gyas.He and his hundred-handed brothers, Briareus and Cæus, were
the sons of Coelus and Terra.][Footnote 303: Verses bring down.--Ver.He alludes to the power of
magic spells, and attributes their efficacy to their being couched
in poetic measures; from which circumstance they received the name of
'carmina.'][Footnote 304: And by verses.--Ver.He means to say that in the
same manner as magic spells have brought down the moon, arrested the
sun, and turned back rivers towards their source, so have his Elegiac
strains been as wonderfully successful in softening the obduracy of his
mistress.]The name Bagoas, or, as it is here
Latinized.Bagous, is said to have signified, in the Persian language,
'an eunuch.'It was probably of Chaldæan origin, having that meaning.As among the Eastern nations of the present day, the more jealous of the
Romans confided the care of their wives or mistresses to eunuch slaves,
who were purchased at a very large price.][Footnote 306: Daughters of Danaus.--Ver.The portico under the
temple of Apollo, on the Palatine Hill, was adorned with the statues of
Danaus, the son of Belus, and his forty-nine guilty daughters.It was
built by Augustus, on a spot adjoining to his palace.Ovid mentions
these statues in the Third Elegy of the Third Book of the Tristia, 1.[Footnote 307: Let him go.--Ver.'Eat' seems here to mean 'let
him go away' from the house; but Nisard's translation renders it 'qu'il
entre,' 'let him come in.'][Footnote 308: At the sacrifice.--Ver.It is hard to say what'si
faciet tarde' means: it perhaps applies to the rites of Isis, mentioned
in the 25th line.]If she shall be slow in her sacrifice.'][Footnote 309: Linen-clad Isis.--Ver.Seethe 74th line of the
Eighth Elegy of the preceding Book, and the Note to the passage; and the
Pontic Epistles, Book i. line 51, and the Note.The temple of Isis,
at Rome, was in the Campus Martius, or Field of Mars, near the sheep
market.It was noted for the intrigues and assignations of which it was
the scene.][Footnote 310: He turns the house.--Ver.As the Delphin Editor
says, 'Il peut renverser la maison,' 'he can turn the house upside
down.'][Footnote 311: The masters approve..--Ver.He means to say that the
eunuch and his mistress will be able to do just as they please.][Footnote 312: An executioner.--Ver.To blind the husband, by
pretending harshness on the part of Bagous.][Footnote 313: Of the truth.--Ver.38 This line is corrupt, and there
are about ten various readings.The meaning, however, is clear; he is,
by making false charges, to lead the husband away from a suspicion of
the truth; and to put him, as we say, in common parlance, on the wrong
scent.][Footnote 314: Your limited savings.--Ver.'Peculium,' here means
the stock of money which a slave, with the consent of his master, laid
up for his own, 'his savings.'The slaves of the Romans being not only
employed in domestic offices and the labours of the field, but as agents
or factors for their masters, in the management of business, and as
mechanics and artisans in various trades, great profits were made
through them.As they were often entrusted with a large amount of
property, and considerable temptations were presented to their honesty,
it became the practice to allow the slave to consider a part of
his gains, perhaps a per centage, as his own; this was termed his
'peculium.'According to the strict letter of the law, the 'peculium'
was the property of the master, but, by usage, it was looked upon as the
property of the slave.It was sometimes agreed upon between the
master and slave, that the latter should purchase his liberty with
his 'peculium,' when it amounted to a certain sum.If the slave was
manumitted by the owner in his lifetime, his 'peculium' was considered
to be given him, with his liberty, unless it was expressly retained.][Footnote 315: Necks of informers.--Ver.He probably alludes to
informers who have given false evidence.He warns Bagous of their fate,
intending to imply that both his mistress and himself will deny all, if
he should attempt to criminate them.][Footnote 325: Tongue caused this.--Ver.According to one account,
his punishment was inflicted for revealing the secrets of the Gods.][Footnote 326: Appointed by Juno.--Ver.This was Argus, whose fate
is related at the end of the First Book of the Metamorphoses.]He is again addressing Bagous, and
begins in a strain of sympathy, since his last letter has proved of no
avail with the obdurate eunuch.][Footnote 328: Mutilate Joys --Ver.According to most accounts,
Semiramis was the first who put in practice this abominable custom.][Footnote 329: Standard be borne.--Ver.He means, that he is bound,
with his mistress to follow the standard of Cupid, and not of Mars.][Footnote 330: Favours to advantage.--Ver.'Ponere' here means,
literally, 'to put out at interest.'He tells the eunuch that he has
now the opportunity of conferring obligations, which will bring him in à
good interest by way of return.][Footnote 332: Sabine dames.--Ver.Juvenal, in his Tenth Satire, 1.293, mentions the Sabine women as examples of prudence and chastity.][Footnote 333: In her stateliness.--Ver.Burmann would have 'ex
alto' to mean 'ex alto pectore,' 'from the depths of her breast.'In
such case the phrase will correspond with our expression, 'to dissemble
deeply,' 'to be a deep dissembler.'][Footnote 334: Modulates her voice.--Ver.Perhaps 'flectere vocem'
means what we technically call, in the musical art, 'to quaver.'][Footnote 335: Her arms to time.--Ver.Dancing was, in general,
discouraged among the Romans.That here referred to was probably the
pantomimic dance, in which, while all parts of the body were called into
action, the gestures of the arms and hands were especially used, whence
the expressions'manus loquacissimi,' 'digiti clamosi,' 'expressive
hands,' or 'fingers.'During the Republic, and the earlier periods of
the Empire, women never appeared on the stage, but they frequently acted
at the parties of the great.As it was deemed disgraceful for a free man
to dance, the practice at Rome was probably confined to slaves, and the
lowest class of the citizens.536, and the
Note to the passage.][Footnote 336: Hippolytus.--Ver.Hippolytus was an example of
chastity, while Priapus was the very ideal of lustfulness.][Footnote 337: Heroines of old.--Ver.He supposes the women of
the Heroic ages to have been of extremely tall stature.Andromache was
remarkable for her height.][Footnote 338: The brunette.--Ver.'Flava,' when coupled with
a female name, generally signifies 'having the hair of a flaxen,' or
'golden colour'; here, however, it seems to allude to the complexion,
though it would be difficult to say what tint is meant.Perhaps an
American would have no difficulty in translating it 'a yellow girl.'In
the 43rd line, he makes reference to the hair of a 'flaxen,' or 'golden
colour.'][Footnote 339: Tablets rubbed out.--Ver.If 'deletæ' is the correct
reading here, it must mean 'no tablets from which in a hurry you 'have
rubbed off the writing.''Non interceptæ' has been suggested, and it
would certainly better suit the sense.'No intercepted tablets have,
&c.'][Footnote 342: The wine on table.--Ver.The wine was probably on
this occasion placed on the table, after the 'coena,' or dinner.The
Poet, his mistress, and his acquaintance, were, probably, reclining
on their respective couches; he probably, pretended to fall asleep to
watch, their conduct, which may have previously excited his suspicions.][Footnote 343: Moving your eyebrows.--Ver.See the Note to the 19th
line of the Fourth Elegy of the preceding Book.][Footnote 344: Were not silent.--Ver.See the Note to the 20th line
of the same Elegy.][Footnote 345: Traced over with wine.--Ver.See the 22nd and 26th
lines of the same Elegy.]He seems to mean that they
were pretending to be talking on a different subject from that about
which they were really discoursing, but that he understood their hidden
meaning.See a similar instance mentioned in the Epistle of Paris to
Helen, 1.[Footnote 347: Hand of a master.--Ver.He asserts the same right
over her favours, that the master (dominus) does over the services of
the slave.][Footnote 348: New-made husband.--Ter.Perhaps this refers to
the moment of taking off the bridal veil, or 'flammeum,' when she has
entered her husband's house.][Footnote 349: Of her steeds.--Ver.When the moon appeared red,
probably through a fog, it was supposed that she was being subjected to
the spells of witches and enchanters.][Footnote 350: Assyrian ivory.--Ver.As Assyria adjoined India,
the word 'Assyrium' is here used by poetical licence, as really meaning
'Indian.'][Footnote 351: Woman has stained.--Ver.From this we learn that it
was the custom of the Lydians to tint ivory of a pink colour, that it
might not turn yellow with age.][Footnote 352: Of this quality.--Ver.'Nota,' here mentioned, is
literally the mark which was put upon the 'amphorae,' or 'cadi,' the
'casks' of the ancients, to denote the kind, age, or quality of the
wine.Hence the word figuratively means, as in the present instance,
'sort,' or 'quality.'Our word 'brand' has a similar meaning.The finer
kinds of wine were drawn off from the 'dolia,' or large vessels, in
which they were kept into the 'amphoræ,' which were made of earthenware
or glass, and the mouth of the vessel was stopped tight by a plug of
wood or cork, which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being
rubbed over with pitch, clay, or a composition of gypsum.On the
outside, the title of the wine was painted, the date of the vintage
being denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office: and when the
vessels were of glass, small tickets, called 'pittacia,' were suspended
from them, stating to a similar effect.For a full account of
the ancient wines, see Dr.Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Antiquities.][Footnote 353: The imitative bird.--Ver.Statius, in his Second
Book, calls the parrot 'Humanæ sollers imitator linguæ,' 'the clever
imitator of the human voice.'][Footnote 354: The long trumpet.--Ver.We learn from Aulus Gellius,
that the trumpeters at funerals were called'siticines.'They headed
the funeral procession, playing mournful strains on the long trumpet,
'tuba,' here mentioned.These were probably in addition to the
'tibicines,' or 'pipers,' whose number was limited to ten by Appius
Claudius, the Censor.See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 360: Affectionate turtle-dove.--Ver.This turtle-dove and
the parrot had been brought up in the same cage together.He probably
refers to these birds in the thirty-eighth line of the Epistle of Sappho
to Phaon where he mentions the turtle-dove as being black.This Elegy is
remarkable for its simplicity and pathetic beauty, and can hardly fail
to remind the reader of Cowper's Elegies, on the death of the bullfinch,
and that of his pet hare.][Footnote 361: The Phocian youth.--Ver.He alludes to the
friendship of Orestes and Pylades the Phocian, the son of Strophius.][Footnote 362: So prettily.--Ver.'Bene' means here, 'prettily,' or
'cleverly,' rather than 'distinctly,' which would be inconsistent with
the signification of blæsus.][Footnote 363: All their battles --Ver.Aristotle, in the Eighth
Chapter of the Ninth Book of his History of Animals, describes quails
or ortolans, and partridges, as being of quarrelsome habits, and much at
war among themselves.][Footnote 364: The foreboder.--Ver.Festus Avienus, in his
Prognostics, mentions the jackdaw as foreboding rain by its chattering.]See the story of the Nymph
Coronis, in the Second Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 367: After nine ages.--Ver.Pliny makes the life of the
crow to last for a period of three hundred years.][Footnote 368: Destined numbers.--Ver.'Numeri' means here, the
similar.parts of one whole: 'the allotted portions of human life.'][Footnote 369: Seventh day was come.--Ver.Hippocrates, in his
Aphorisms, mentions the seventh, fourteenth, and twentieth, as the
critical days in a malady.Ovid may here possibly allude to the seventh
day of fasting, which was supposed to terminate the existence of the
person so doing.][Footnote 370: Corinna, farewell.--Ver.It may have said 'Corinna;'
but Ovid must excuse us if we decline to believe that it said 'vale,'
'farewell,' also; unless, indeed, it had been in the habit of saying so
before; this, perhaps, may have been the case, as it had probably often
heard the Poet say 'vale' to his mistress.][Footnote 371: The Elysian hill.--Ver.He kindly imagines a place
for the souls of the birds that are blessed.][Footnote 372: By his words.--Ver.His calling around him, in
human accents, the other birds in the Elysian fields, is ingeniously and
beautifully imagined.][Footnote 377: This very tomb.--Ver.This and the following line
are considered by Heinsius to be spurious, and, indeed, the next line
hardly looks like the composition of Ovid.][Footnote 378: Am I then.--Ver.'Am
I always then to be made the subject of fresh charges?'][Footnote 379: Long-eared ass.--Ver.Perhaps the only holiday that
the patient ass got throughout the year, was in the month of June,
when the festival of Vesta was celebrated, and to which Goddess he had
rendered an important service.See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver.She was the 'ornatrix,'
or 'tiring woman' of Corinna.As slaves very often received their names
from articles of dress, Cypassis was probably so called from the
garment called 'cypassis,' which was worn by women and men of effeminate
character, and extended downwards to the ancles.][Footnote 387: With the whip.--Ver.From this we see that the whip
was applied to the female slaves, as well as the males.][Footnote 388: Carpathian ocean..--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
xi.][Footnote 389: Swarthy Cypassis.--Ver.From this expression, she
was probably a native of Egypt or Syria.][Footnote 390: With his spear.--Ver.He alludes to the cure of
Telephus by the aid of the spear of Achilles, which had previously
wounded him.][Footnote 391: Cottages of thatch.--Ver.In the First Book of the
Fasti, 1.199, he speaks of the time when 'a little cottage received
Quiriuus, the begotten of Mars, and the sedge of the stream afforded him
a scanty couch.'The straw-thatched cottage of Romulus was preserved at
Rome for many centuries.184, and the Note
to the passage.][Footnote 392: Off to the fields.--Ver.The 'emeriti,' or veterans
of the Roman legions, who had served their full time, received a regular
discharge, which was called'missio,' together with a bounty, either in
money, or an allotment of land.Virgil was deprived of his property near
Mantua, by the officers of Augustus; and in his first Eclogue, under
the name of Tityrus, he relates how he obtained restitution of it on
applying to the Emperor.][Footnote 393: Free from the race.--Ver.Literally, 'the starting
place.'][Footnote 394: Wand of repose--Ver.For an account of the 'rudis,'
and the privilege it conferred, see the Tristia, Book, iv, El.[Footnote 395: Græcinus.--Ver.He addresses three of his Pontic
Epistles, namely, the Sixth of the First Book, the Sixth of the Second
Book, and the Ninth of the Fourth Book, to his friend Græcinus.In the
latter Epistle, he congratulates him upon his being Consul elect.][Footnote 396: Without my arms.--Ver.'Inermis,' may be rendered,
'off my guard.'][Footnote 397: Like the skiff.--Ver.'Pliaselos' is perhaps here
used as a general name for a boat or skiff; but the vessel which was
particularly so called, was long and narrow, and probably received its
name from its resemblance to a kidney-bean, which was called 'ptaselus.'The 'phaseli' were chiefly used by the Egyptians, and were of various
sizes, from that of a mere boat to a vessel suited for a long voyage.Appian mentions them as being a medium between ships of war and merchant
vessels.Being built for speed, they were more noted for their swiftness
than for their strength.127, speaks of them as
being made of clay; but, of course, that can only refer to 'pha-seli' of
the smallest kind.][Footnote 401: That are thin.--Ver 23.[Footnote 402: Arm his breast --Ver.He alludes to the 'lorica,' or
cuirass, which was worn by the soldiers.][Footnote 403: Of his battles.--Ver.He probably was thinking at
this moment of the deaths of Cornelius Gallus, and T. Haterius, of the
Equcstriai order, whose singular end is mentioned by Valerius Maximus,
11. ix c.8, and by Pliny the Elder, B.[Footnote 404: The meeting rocks.--Ver 3.See the 121st line of the
Epistle of Medea to Jason, and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 405: Tinted pebbles.--Ver.The 'picti lapilli' are
probably camelians, which are found on the sea shore, and are of various
tints.]'Mora,' 'delay,' is put here
for that which causes the delay.'That is a pleasure which belongs to
the shore.'][Footnote 407: In what Malea.--Ver.Propertius and Virgil also
couple Malea, the dangerous promontory on the South of Laconia, with the
Syrtes or quicksands of the Libyan coast.][Footnote 409: Stars of the fruitful Leda.--Ver.Commentators are
divided upon the exact meaning of this line.Some think that it refers
to the Constellations of Castor and Pollux, which were considered to be
favourable to mariners; and which Horace mentions in the first line
of his Third Ode, B. i., 'Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,' 'The
brothers of Helen, those brilliant stars.'Others think that it refers
to the luminous appearances which were seen to settle on the masts
of ships, and were called by the name of Castor and Pollux; they were
thought to be of good omen when both appeared, but unlucky when seen
singly.][Footnote 410: In the couch.--Ver.'Torus' most probably means, in
this place a sofa, on which the ladies would recline while reading.][Footnote 411: Amusing books.--Ver.By using the diminutive
'libellus' here, he probably means some light work, such as a bit of
court scandal, of a love poem.][Footnote 412: My Divinities.--Ver.126,
and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 413: As a table.--Ver.This denotes his impatience to
entertain her once again, and to hear the narrative of her adventures.][Footnote 414: Though they be fictions.--Ver.He gives a sly hit
here at the tales of travellers.][Footnote 415: Twice five years.--Ver.Or the 'lustrum' of the
Romans, see the Fasti, Book iii.166, and the Tristia, Book iv.[Footnote 416: And the cause.--Ver.This passage is evidently
misunderstood in Nisard's translation, 'Je ne serai pas non plus la caus
d'une nouvelle guerre,' 'I will never more be the cause of a new war.'][Footnote 417: A female again.--Ver.He alludes to the war in
Latium, between Æneas and Turnus, for the hand of Lavinia, the daughter
of Latinus and Amata.See the narrative in the Fourteenth book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 421: 'Twas the females--Ver.The rape of the Sabines, by
the contrivance of Romulus, is here alluded to.The narrative will
be found in the Third Book of the Fasti, 1.It has been
suggested, but apparently without any good grounds, that Tarpeia is here
alluded to.][Footnote 422: Thou who dost.--Ver.Io was said to be worshipped
under the name of Isis.][Footnote 423: Parætonium.--Ver.This city was situate at the
Canopic mouth of the Nile, at the Western extremity of Egypt, adjoining
to Libya.According to Strabo, its former name was Ammonia.It
still preserves its ancient name in a great degree, as it is called
al-Baretoun.][Footnote 424: Fields of Canopus.--Ver.Canopus was a city at one
of the mouths of the Nile, now called Aboukir.The epithet
'genialis,' seems to have been well deserved, as it was famous for its
voluptuousness.Strabo tells us that there was a temple there dedicated
to Serapis, to which multitudes resorted by the canal from Alexandria.He says that the canal was filled, night and day, with men and women
dancing and playing music on board the vessels, with the greatest
licentiousness.The place was situate on an island of the Nile, and
was about fifteen miles distant from Alexandria.Ovid gives a similar
description of Alexandria, in the Tristia, Book i. El.Memphis was a city situate on the
North of Egypt, on the banks of the Nile.It was said to have been built
by Osirit.]See the Metamorphoses, Book ix.[Footnote 428: By thy sistra.For an account of the mystic
'sistra' of Isis, see the Pontic Epistles, Book i. El.For an account of Anuhis, the Deity
with the dog's head, see the Metamorphoses, Book ix.See the Metamorphoses, Book ix.[Footnote 431: The sluggish serpent.--Ver.Macrobius tells us, that
the Egyptians accompanied the statue of Serapis with that of an animal
with three heads, the middle one that of a lion, the one to the right,
of a dog, and that to the left, of a ravenous wolf; and that a serpent
was represented encircling it in its folds, with its head below the
right hand of the statue of the Deity.To this the Poet possibly
alludes, or else to the asp, which was common in the North of Egypt, and
perhaps, was looked upon as sacred.If so, it is probable that the word
'pigra,''sluggish,' refers to the drowsy effect produced by the sting
of the asp, which was generally mortal.This, indeed, seems the more
likely, from the fact of the asp being clearly referred to, in company
with these Deities, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.93; which
see, with the Note to the passage.][Footnote 432: The horned Apis.--Ver.See the Ninth Book of the
Metamorphoses, 1.Isis is here addressed, as
being supposed to be the same Deity as Diana Lucina, who was invoked by
pregnant and parturient women.Thus Isis appears to Telethusa, a Cretan
woman, in her pregnancy, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 434: Thy appointed days.--Ver.Votaries who were
worshipping in the temples of the Deities sat there for a considerable
time, especially when they attended for the purpose of sacrifice.In
the First Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep.50, Ovid says, 'I have
beheld one who confessed that he had offended the Divinity of Isis,
clothed in linen, sitting before he altars of Isis.']'Queis' seems a preferable reading
to 'qua.'][Footnote 436: The Galli.--Ver.Some suppose that Isis and Cybele
were the same Divinity, and that the Galli, or priests of Cybele,
attended the rites of their Goddess under the name of Isis.It seems
clear, from the present passage, that the priests of Cybele, who were
called Galli, did perform the rites of Isis, but there is abundant proof
that these were considered as distinct Deities.In imitation of the
Corybantes, the original priests of Cybele, they performed her rites
to the sound of pipes and tambourines, and ran to and fro in a frenzied
manner.][Footnote 437: With thy laurels.--Ver.See the Note to the 692nd
line of the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses.While celebrating the
search for the limbs of Osiris, the priests uttered lamentations,
accompanied with the sound of the'sistra'; but when they had found the
body, they wore wreaths of laurel, and uttered cries, signifying their
joy.][Footnote 438: Ilithyia.--Ver.As to the Goddess Ilithyia, see the
Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 439: With their bucklers.--Ver.Armed with 'peltæ,' or
bucklers, like the Amazons.][Footnote 440: The sand must.--Ver.This figure is derived from the
gladiatorial fights of the amphitheatre, where the spot on which they
fought was strewed with sand, both for the purpose of giving a firm
footing to the gladiators, and of soaking up the blood that was shed.][Footnote 441: Again throw stones.--Ver.He alludes to Deucalion
and Pyr-rha.See the First Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 442: Ilia had destroyed.--Ver.See
her story, related at the beginning of the Third Book of the Fasti.][Footnote 443: Why pierce.--Ver.He alludes to the sharp
instruments which she had used for the purpose of procuring abortion:
a practice which Canace tells Macareus that her nurse had resorted to.See the Metamorphoses, Book
viii.[Footnote 445: Many a time.--Ver.He seems here to speak of this
practice as being frequently resorted to.][Footnote 446: She deserved it.--Ver.From this, it would seem that
the practice was considered censurable; but, perhaps it was one of those
cases whose heinousness is never fully discovered till it has brought
about its own punishment.][Footnote 447: O ring.--Ver.On the rings in use among the ancients,
see the note to the First Book of the Aruores, El.See also
the subject of the seventh Elegy of the First Book of the Tristia.][Footnote 448: Carpathian old man.--Ver.For some account of
Proteus, who is here referred to, see the First Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 449: Be able to seal--Ver.From this, it appears to have
been a signet ring.][Footnote 450: Touch the lips.--Ver.See the Tristia, Book v., El.1 5, and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 459: In her desk.--Ver.'Loculi' used in the plural,
as in the present instance, signified a receptacle with compartments,
similar, perhaps, to our writing desks; a small box, coffer, casket, or
cabinet of wood or ivory, for keeping money or jewels.]See the Note to the first line of the
First Elegy of this Book.][Footnote 461: Pelignian land.--Ver.From Pliny the Elder, we learn
that the Peligni were divided into three tribes, the Corfinienses, the
Superequani, and the Sulmonenses.][Footnote 462: Constellation.--Ver.He alludes to the heat attending
the Dog star, see the Fasti, Book iv., 1.939, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 463: The thin soil.--Ver.'Rarus ager' means, a 'thin' or
'loose' soil, which was well suited for the cultivation of the grape.][Footnote 464: That bears its berries.--Ver.In Nisard's
translation, the words 'bacciferam Pallada,' which mean the olive, are
rendered 'L'amande Caere Pallas,' 'the almond dear to Pallas.'][Footnote 465: Lengthened tracks.--Ver.To the Delphin Editor this
seems a silly expression.][Footnote 466: The stormy Alps.--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
ii.[Footnote 467: The obedient stream.--Ver.This was a method of
irrigation in agriculture, much resorted to by the ancients.][Footnote 468: Fierce Cilicians --Ver.The people of the interior
of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, were of rude and savage manners while those
on the coast had been engaged in piracy, until it had been effectually
suppressed by Pompey.][Footnote 469: Britons painted green.--Ver.The Britons may be
called 'virides,' from their island being surrounded by the sea; or,
more probably, from the colour with which they were in the habit of
staining their bodies.Cæsar says, in the Fifth Book of the Gallic war,
'The Britons stain themselves with woad, 'vitrum,' or 'glastum,'
which produces a blue colour: and thus they become of a more dreadful
appearance in battle.'The conquest of Britain, by Cæsar, is alluded to
in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 471: Loves the vine.--Ver.The custom of training vines
by the side of the elm, has been alluded to in a previous Note.See also
the Metamorphoses, Book xiv.[Footnote 472: As the nags.--Ver.The'manni' were used by the
Romans for much the same purpose as our coach-horses; and were probably
more noted for their fleetness than their strength; They were a small
breed, originally imported from Gaul, and the possession of them was
supposed to indicate the possession of considerable wealth.As the
'esseda' was a small vehicle, and probably of light structure, we must
not be surprised at Corinna being in the habit of driving for herself.The distance from Rome to Sulmo was about ninety miles: and the journey,
from his expressions in the fifty-first and fifty-second lines, must
have been over hill and dale.][Footnote 473: Your little chaise.--Ver.For an account of the
'essedum,' or 'esseda,' see the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.34,
and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 474: King of Pkthia.--Ver.He alludes to the marriage of
Thetis, the sea Goddess, to Peleus, the king of Phthia, in Thessaly.][Footnote 475: His anvil.--Ver.It is a somewhat curious fact,
that the anvils of the ancients exactly resembled in form and every
particular those used at the present day.][Footnote 476: Becomingly united.--Ver.He says, that in the
Elegiac measure the Pentameter, or line of five feet, is not unhappily
matched with the Hexameter, or heroic line of six feet.][Footnote 477: Disavowed by you.--Ver.'Voids' seems more agreable
to the sense of the passage, than 'nobis.''to be denied by us;' as,
from the context, there was no fear of his declining her affection.][Footnote 478: That she is Corinna.--Ver.This clearly proves that
Corinna was not a real name; it probably was not given by the Poet to
any one of his female acquaintances in particular.][Footnote 479: Thy poem onwards.--Ver.Macer translated the Iliad of
Homer into Latin verse, and composed an additional poem, commencing
at the beginning of the Trojan war, and coming down to the wrath of
Achilles, with which Homer begins.][Footnote 480: I, Macer.--Ver.Æmilius Macer is often mentioned
by Ovid in his works.10,1.41, he says,
'Macer, when stricken in years, many a time repeated to me his poem on
birds, and each serpent that is deadly, each herb that is curative.'The
Tenth Epistle of the Second Book of Pontic Epistles is also addressed to
him, in which Ovid alludes to his work on the Trojan war, and the time
when they visited Asia Minor and Sicily together.He speaks of him in
the Sixteenth Epistle of the Fourth Book, as being then dead.Macer was
a native of Verona, and was the intimate friend of Virgil, Ovid, and
Tibullus.Some suppose that the poet who wrote on natural history, was
not the same with him who wrote on the Trojan war; and, indeed, it does
not seem likely, that he who was an old man in the youth of Ovid, should
be the same person to whom he writes from Pontus, when about fifty-six
years of age.The bard of Ilium died in Asia.][Footnote 481: Tragedy grew apace.--Ver.He alludes to his tragedy
of Medea, which no longer exists.Quintilian thus speaks of it: 'The
Medea of Ovid seems to me to prove how much he was capable of, if he had
only preferred to curb his genius, rather than indulge it.'][Footnote 482: Sabinus return.--Ver.He represents his friend,
Sabinus, here in the character of a 'tabellarius,' or 'letter carrier,'
going with extreme speed (celer) to the various parts of the earth, and
bringing back the answers of Ulysses to Penelope, Hippolytus to Phaedra,
Æneas to Dido, Demophoôn to Phyllis, Jason to Hypsipyle, and Phaon to
Sappho.All these works of Sabinus have perished, except the Epistle of
Ulysses to Penelope, and Demophoôn to Phyllis.His Epistle from Paris
to Oenonc, is not here mentioned.See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 483: Bring back letters.--Ver.As the ancients had
no establishment corresponding to our posts, they employed special
messengers called 'tabellarii,' for the conveyance of their letters.][Footnote 484: Vowed to Phobus.--Ver.Sappho says in her Epistle,
that if Phaon should refuse to return, she will dedicate her lyre to
Phobus, and throw herself from the Leucadian rock.This, he tells her,
she may now-do, as by his answer Phaon declines to return.][Footnote 485: Pain in her head.--Ver.She pretended a head-ache,
when nothing wras the matter with her; in order that too much
familiarity, in the end, might not breed contempt.][Footnote 486: A surfeit of love.--Ver.'l'inguis amor' seems here
to mear a satisfied 'ora 'pampered passion;' one that meets with no
repulse.][Footnote 487: Enclosed Danaë.--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
iv., 1.][Footnote 488: The dogs bark.--Ver.The women of loose character,
among the Romans, were much in the habit of keeping dogs, for the
protection of their houses.]FOOTNOTES BOOK THREE:

[Footnote 501: Than the other.--Ver.'He alludes to the unequal
lines of the Elegiac measure, which consists of Hexameters and
Pentameters.In personifying Elegy, he might have omitted this remark,
as it does not add to the attractions of a lady, to have one foot longer
than the other; he says, however, that it added to her gracefulness.][Footnote 502: The Lydian buskin.--Ver.As Lydia was said to
have sent colonists to Etruria, some Commentators think that the word
'Lydius' here means 'Etrurian and that the first actors at Rome were
Etrurians.But, as the Romans derived their notions of tragedy from the
Greeks, we may conclude that Lydia in Asia Minor is here referred
to; for we learn from Herodotus and other historians, that the Greeks
borrowed largely from the Lydians.][Footnote 503: Drunken revels.--Ver.He probably alludes to the
Fourth Elegy of the First, and the Fifth Elegy of the Second Book of the
'Amores.']The 'thyrsus' was said to
have been first used by the troops of Bacchus, in his Indian expedition,
when, to deceive the Indians, they concealed the points of their spears
amid leaves of the vine and ivy.Similar weapons were used by his
devotees when worshipping him, which they brandished to and fro.To be
touched with the thyrsus of Bacchus, meant 'to be inspired with poetic
frenzy.'See the Notes to the Metamorphoses, Book iii.[Footnote 506: In unequal numbers.--Ver.Some have supposed, that
allusion is made to the Tragedy of Medea, which Ovid had composed, and
that it had been written in Elegiac measure.This, however, does not
seem to be the meaning of the passage.Elegy justly asks Tragedy, why,
if she has such a dislike to Elegiac verses, she has been talking in
them?which she has done, from the 15th line to the 30th.][Footnote 507: Myself the patroness.--Ver.She certainly does
not give herself a very high character in giving herself the title of
'lena.'][Footnote 508: The fastened door.--Ver.He alludes, probably, to
one of the Elegies which he rejected, when he cut down the five books to
three.][Footnote 509: In a hose tunic.--Ver.He may possibly allude to the
Fifth Elegy of the First Book, as the words 'tunicâ velata recinctâ,' as
applied to Corinna, are there found.But there he mentions midday as the
time when Corinna came to him, whereas he seems here to allude to the
middle of the night.][Footnote 510: Cut in the wood.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
lovers carving inscriptions on the doors of their obdurate mistresses:
this we learn from Plautus to have been done in Elegiac strains, and
sometimes with charcoal.'Implentur meæ fores clegiarum carbonibus.''My
doors are filled with the coal-black marks of elegies.'][Footnote 511: On her birthday.--Ver.She is telling Ovid what she
has put up with for his sake; and she reminds him how, when he sent to
his mistress some complimentary lines on her birthday, she tore them
up and threw them in the water.Horace mentions 'the flames, or the
Adriatic sea,' as the end of verses that displeased.Athenseus, Book
xiii.5, relates a somewhat similai story.Diphilus the poet was in
the habit of sending his verses to his mistress Gnathæna.One day she
was mixing him a cup of wine and snow-water, on which he observed, how
cold her well must be; to which she answered, yes, for it was there that
she used to throw his compositions.][Footnote 514: From behind.--Ver.It is not known, for certain, to
what he refers in this line.Some think that he refers to the succeeding
Elegies in this Book, which are, in general, longer than the former
ones, while others suppose that he refers to his Metamorphoses, which he
then contemplated writing.Burmann, however, is not satisfied with this
explanation, and thinks that, in his more mature years, he contemplated
the composition of Tragedy, after having devoted his youth to lighter
snbjects; and that he did not compose, or even contemplate the
composition of his Metamorphoses, until many years afterwards.][Footnote 515: I am not sitting here.--Ver.He is here alluding to
the Circen-sian games, which were celebrating in the Circus Maximus, or
greatest Circus, at Rome, at different times in the year.Some account
is given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1.392. of the Second Book
of the Fasti.The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the
Fourth of the Ides of April.The buildings of the Circus were burnt in
the conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored
till the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former
magnificence, and made it capable, according to some authors, of
accommodating 385,000 persons.The Poet says, that he takes no
particular interest himself in the race, but hopes that the horse may
win which is her favourite.][Footnote 516: The spirited steeds.--Ver.The usual number of
chariots in each race was four.The charioteers were divided into four
companies, or 'fac-tiones,' each distinguished by a colour, representing
the season of the year.These colours were green for the spring, red for
the summer, azure for the autumn, and white for the winter.Originally,
but two chariots started in each race; but Domitian increased the number
to six, appointing two new companies of charioteers, the golden and the
purple; however the number was still, more usually, restricted to four.The greatest interest was shewn by all classes, and by both sexes, in
the race.Lists of the horses were circulated, with their names and
colours; the names also of the charioteers were given, and bets were
extensively made, (see the Art of Love, Book i.167, 168,) and
sometimes disputes and violent contests arose.][Footnote 517: To be seated by you.--Ver.The men and women sat
together when viewing the contests of the Circus, and not in separate
parts of the building, as at the theatres.][Footnote 518: Happy the driver.--Ver.[Footnote 519: The sacred barrier.--Ver.For an account of the
'career,' or'starting-place,' see the Notes to the Tristia, Book v. El.It is called'sacer,' because the whole of the Circus Maximus
was sacred to Consus, who is supposed by some to have been the same
Deity as Neptune.The games commenced with sacrifices to the Deities.][Footnote 520: I would give rein.--Ver.The charioteer was wont
to stand within the reins, having them thrown round his back.Leaning
backwards, he thereby threw his full weight against the horses, when
he wished to check them at full speed.This practice, however, was
dangerous, and by it the death of Hippolytus was caused.In the
Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses,1.524, he says, 'I struggled,
with unavailing hand, to guide the bridle covered with white foam, and
throwing myself "backwards, I pulled back the loosened reins.'To avoid
the danger of this practice, the charioteer carried a hooked knife at
his waist, for the purpose of cutting the reins on an emergency.][Footnote 521: The turning-place.--Ver.'see the Tristia, Book iv.Of course, thpse who
kept as close to the'meta' as possible, would lose the least distance
in turning round it.][Footnote 522: How nearly was Pelops.--Ver.In his race with
Onomaüs, king of Pisa, in Arcadia, for the hand of his daughter,
Hippodamia, when Pelops conquered his adversary by bribing his
charioteer, Myrtilus.][Footnote 523: Of his mistress.--Ver.He here seems to imply that
it was Hippodamia who bribed Myrtilus.][Footnote 524: Shrink away in vain.--Ver.She shrinks from him, and
seems to think that he is sitting too close, but he tells her that the
'linea' forces them to squeeze.This 'linea' is supposed to have been
either cord, or a groove, drawn across the seats at regular intervals,
so as to mark out room for a certain number of spectators between each
two 'lineæ.'][Footnote 525: Has this advantage.--Ver.He congratulates himsdf on
the construction of the place, so aptly giving him an excuse for sitting
close to his mistress.][Footnote 526: But do you --Ver.He is pretending to be very
anxious for her comfort, and is begging the person on the other side not
to squeeze so close against his mistress.][Footnote 527: And you as well.--Ver.As in the theatres, the
seats, which were called 'gradas,''sedilia,' or'subsellia,' were
arranged round the course of the Circus, in ascending tiers; the lowest
being, very probably, almost flush with the ground.There were, perhaps,
no backs to the seats, or, at the best, only a slight railing of wood.The knees consequently of those in the back row would be level, and in
juxta-position with the backs of those in front.He is here telling the
person who is sitting behind, to be good enough to keep his knees to
himself, and not to hurt the lady's back by pressing against her.][Footnote 528: I am taking it up.--Ver.He is here showing off his
politeness, and will not give her the trouble of gathering up her dress.Even in those days, the ladies seem to have had no objection to their
dresses doing the work of the scavenger's broom.][Footnote 529: The fleet Atalanta.--Ver.Some suppose that the
Arcadian Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, was beloved by a youth of the
name of Milanion.According to Apollodorus, who evidently confounds
the Arcadian with the Boeotian Atalanta, Milanion was another name of
Hippo-menes, who conquered the latter in the foot race, as mentioned
in the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses.See the Translation of the
Metamorphoses, p.From this and another passage of Ovid, we have
reason to suppose that Atalanta was, by tradition, famous for the beauty
