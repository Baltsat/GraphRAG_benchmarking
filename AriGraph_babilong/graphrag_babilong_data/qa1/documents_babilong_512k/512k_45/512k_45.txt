Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?The roe of the mullet pressed flat and dried; that of

very near fuddled.My head hath aked all night, and all this morning, with my last
night's debauch.Called up this morning by Lieutenant Lambert, who is now
made Captain of the Norwich, and he and I went down by water to Greenwich,
in our way observing and discoursing upon the things of a ship, he telling
me all I asked him, which was of good use to me.There we went and eat
and drank and heard musique at the Globe, and saw the simple motion that
is there of a woman with a rod in her hand keeping time to the musique
while it plays, which is simple, methinks.Back again by water, calling
at Captain Lambert's house, which is very handsome and neat, and a fine
prospect at top.So to the office, where we sat a little, and then the
Captain and I again to Bridewell to Mr.Holland's, where his wife also, a
plain dowdy, and his mother was.Holland the money due
from me to her husband.Here came two young gentlewomen to see Mr.Holland, and one of them could play pretty well upon the viallin, but,
good God!how these ignorant people did cry her up for it!I staid and supped there, and so home and to bed.The weather
very hot, this night I left off my wastecoat.To my Lord's at Whitehall, but not finding him I went to the
Wardrobe and there dined with my Lady, and was very kindly treated by her.After dinner to the office, and there till late at night.So home, and to
Sir William Batten's, who is come this day from Chatham with my Lady, who
is and has been much troubled with the toothache.Here I staid till late,
and so home and to bed.To Whitehall to my Lord, who did tell me that he would have me go to
Mr.Townsend, whom he had ordered to discover to me the whole mystery of
the Wardrobe, and none else but me, and that he will make me deputy with
him for fear that he should die in my Lord's absence, of which I was glad.Creed, and dined together, and
then I went to the Theatre and there saw Bartholomew Faire, the first time
it was acted now a-days.It is a most admirable play and well acted, but
too much prophane and abusive.Creed at the
door, he and I went to the tobacco shop under Temple Bar gate, and there
went up to the top of the house and there sat drinking Lambeth ale a good
while.Then away home, and in my way called upon Mr.Rawlinson (my uncle
Wight being out of town), for his advice to answer a letter of my uncle
Robert, wherein he do offer me a purchase to lay some money upon, that
joynes upon some of his own lands, and plainly telling me that the reason
of his advice is the convenience that it will give me as to his estate, of
which I am exceeding glad, and am advised to give up wholly the disposal
of my money to him, let him do what he will with it, which I shall do.This day my wife put on her black silk gown, which is
now laced all over with black gimp lace, as the fashion is, in which she
is very pretty.She and I walked to my Lady's at the Wardrobe, and there
dined and was exceeding much made of.After dinner I left my wife there,
and I walked to Whitehall, and then went to Mr.Pierce's and sat with his
wife a good while (who continues very pretty) till he came, and then he
and I, and Mr.Symons (dancing master), that goes to sea with my Lord, to
the Swan tavern, and there drank, and so again to White Hall, and there
met with Dean Fuller, and walked a great while with him; among other
things discoursed of the liberty the Bishop (by name the of Galloway)
takes to admit into orders any body that will; among others, Roundtree, a
simple mechanique that was a person [parson?]He
told me he would complain of it.By and by we went and got a sculler, and
landing him at Worcester House, I and W. Howe, who came to us at
Whitehall, went to the Wardrobe, where I met with Mr.Townsend, who is
very willing he says to communicate anything for my Lord's advantage to me
as to his business.I went up to Jane Shore's towre, and there W. Howe
and I sang, and so took my wife and walked home, and so to bed.After I
came home a messenger came from my Lord to bid me come to him tomorrow
morning.Early to my Lord's, who privately told me how the King had made him
Embassador in the bringing over the Queen.[Katherine of Braganza, daughter of John IV.of Portugal, born 1638,

House, this being the solemn day of choosing Master, and my Lord is
chosen, so he dines there to-day.I staid and dined with my Lady; but
after we were set, comes in some persons of condition, and so the children
and I rose and dined by ourselves, all the children and I, and were very
merry and they mighty fond of me.Then to the office, and there sat
awhile.So home and at night to bed, where we lay in Sir R. Slingsby's
lodgings in the dining room there in one green bed, my house being now in
its last work of painting and whiting.At the office this morning, Sir G. Carteret with us; and we agreed
upon a letter to the Duke of York, to tell him the sad condition of this
office for want of money; how men are not able to serve us more without
some money; and that now the credit of the office is brought so low, that
none will sell us any thing without our personal security given for the
same.All the afternoon abroad about several businesses, and at night
home and to bed.Wednesday, a day kept between a fast and a feast, the Bishops not
being ready enough to keep the fast for foul weather before fair weather
came; and so they were forced to keep it between both.[A Form of Prayer was published to be used in London on the 12th,
     and in the country on the 19th of June, being the special days
     appointed for a general fast to be kept in the respective places for

to drink our morning draft, where at the Three Mariners, a place noted for
their ale, we went and staid awhile very merry, and so away.And wanting a
boat, we found Captain Bun going down the river, and so we went into his
boat having a lady with him, and he landed them at Westminster and me at
the Bridge.At home all day with my workmen, and doing several things,
among others writing the letter resolved of yesterday to the Duke.Then
to White Hall, where I met my Lord, who told me he must have L300 laid out
in cloth, to give in Barbary, as presents among the Turks.At which
occasion of getting something I was very glad.Home to supper, and then to
Sir R. Slingsby, who with his brother and I went to my Lord's at the
Wardrobe, and there staid a great while, but he being now taking his leave
of his friends staid out late, and so they went away.Anon came my Lord
in, and I staid with him a good while, and then to bed with Mr.I went up and down to Alderman Backwell's, but his servants not
being up, I went home and put on my gray cloth suit and faced white coat,
made of one of my wife's pettycoates, the first time I have had it on, and
so in a riding garb back again and spoke with Mr.Shaw at the Alderman's,
who offers me L300 if my Lord pleases to buy this cloth with, which
pleased me well.So to the Wardrobe and got my Lord to order Mr.Creed to
imprest so much upon me to be paid by Alderman Backwell.So with my Lord
to Whitehall by water, and he having taken leave of the King, comes to us
at his lodgings and from thence goes to the garden stairs and there takes
barge, and at the stairs was met by Sir R. Slingsby, who there took his
leave of my Lord, and I heard my Lord thank him for his kindness to me,
which Sir Robert answered much to my advantage.I went down with my Lord
in the barge to Deptford, and there went on board the Dutch yacht and
staid there a good while, W. Howe not being come with my Lord's things,
which made my Lord very angry.By and by he comes and so we set sayle,
and anon went to dinner, my Lord and we very merry; and after dinner I
went down below and there sang, and took leave of W. Howe, Captain Rolt,
and the rest of my friends, then went up and took leave of my Lord, who
give me his hand and parted with great respect.So went and Captain
Ferrers with me into our wherry, and my Lord did give five guns, all they
had charged, which was the greatest respect my Lord could do me, and of
which I was not a little proud.So with a sad and merry heart I left them
sailing pleasantly from Erith, hoping to be in the Downs tomorrow early.Pulled off our stockings and bathed our legs
a great while in the river, which I had not done some years before.By
and by we come to Greenwich, and thinking to have gone on the King's
yacht, the King was in her, so we passed by, and at Woolwich went on
shore, in the company of Captain Poole of Jamaica and young Mr.Kennersley, and many others, and so to the tavern where we drank a great
deal both wine and beer.So we parted hence and went home with Mr.Falconer, who did give us cherrys and good wine.So to boat, and young
Poole took us on board the Charity and gave us wine there, with which I
had full enough, and so to our wherry again, and there fell asleep till I
came almost to the Tower, and there the Captain and I parted, and I home
and with wine enough in my head, went to bed.To Whitehall to my Lord's, where I found Mr.Edward Montagu and his
family come to lie during my Lord's absence.I sent to my house by my
Lord's order his shipp--[Qy.So to my father's, and did give him order about the buying of
this cloth to send to my Lord.But I could not stay with him myself, for
having got a great cold by my playing the fool in the water yesterday I
was in great pain, and so went home by coach to bed, and went not to the
office at all, and by keeping myself warm, I broke wind and so came to
some ease.Rose and eat some supper, and so to bed again.My father came and drank his morning draft with me, and sat with me
till I was ready, and so he and I about the business of the cloth.By and
by I left him and went and dined with my Lady, who, now my Lord is gone,
is come to her poor housekeeping again.Then to my father's, who tells me
what he has done, and we resolved upon two pieces of scarlet, two of
purple, and two of black, and L50 in linen.I home, taking L300 with me
home from Alderman Backwell's.After writing to my Lord to let him know
what I had done I was going to bed, but there coming the purser of the
King's yacht for victualls presently, for the Duke of York is to go down
to-morrow, I got him to promise stowage for these things there, and so I
went to bed, bidding Will go and fetch the things from the carrier's
hither, which about 12 o'clock were brought to my house and laid there all
night.But no purser coming in the morning for them, and I
hear that the Duke went last night, and so I am at a great loss what to
do; and so this day (though the Lord's day) staid at home, sending Will up
and down to know what to do.Sometimes thinking to continue my resolution
of sending by the carrier to be at Deal on Wednesday next, sometimes to
send them by sea by a vessel on purpose, but am not yet come to a
resolution, but am at a very great loss and trouble in mind what in the
world to do herein.The afternoon (while Will was abroad) I spent in
reading "The Spanish Gypsey," a play not very good, though commended much.At night resolved to hire a Margate Hoy, who would go away to-morrow
morning, which I did, and sent the things all by him, and put them on
board about 12 this night, hoping to have them as the wind now serves in
the Downs to-morrow night.To-bed with some quiet of mind, having sent
the things away.Visited this morning by my old friend Mr.Carter, who staid and
went to Westminster with me, and there we parted, and I to the Wardrobe
and dined with my Lady.So home to my painters, who are now about
painting my stairs.So to the office, and at night we all went to Sir W.
Pen's, and there sat and drank till 11 at night, and so home and to bed.All this morning at home vexing about the delay of my painters, and
about four in the afternoon my wife and I by water to Captain Lambert's,
where we took great pleasure in their turret-garden, and seeing the fine
needle-works of his wife, the best I ever saw in my life, and afterwards
had a very handsome treat and good musique that she made upon the
harpsicon, and with a great deal of pleasure staid till 8 at night, and so
home again, there being a little pretty witty child that is kept in their
house that would not let us go without her, and so fell a-crying by the
water-side.So home, where I met Jack Cole, who staid with me a good
while, and is still of the old good humour that we were of at school
together, and I am very glad to see him.All the morning almost at home, seeing my stairs finished by the
painters, which pleases me well.Moore to Westminster Hall,
it being term, and then by water to the Wardrobe, where very merry, and so
home to the office all the afternoon, and at night to the Exchange to my
uncle Wight about my intention of purchasing at Brampton.So back again
home and at night to bed.Thanks be to God I am very well again of my
late pain, and to-morrow hope to be out of my pain of dirt and trouble in
my house, of which I am now become very weary.One thing I must observe
here while I think of it, that I am now become the most negligent man in
the world as to matters of news, insomuch that, now-a-days, I neither can
tell any, nor ask any of others.At home the greatest part of the day to see my workmen make an end,
which this night they did to my great content.This morning going to my father's I met him, and so he and I went
and drank our morning draft at the Samson in Paul's Churchyard, and eat
some gammon of bacon, &c., and then parted, having bought some green
Say--[A woollen cloth."Saye clothe serge."--Palsgrave.]Home, and so to the Exchequer, where I met with my uncle
Wight, and home with him to dinner, where among others (my aunt being out
of town), Mr.Norbury and I did discourse of his wife's house and land at
Brampton, which I find too much for me to buy.Home, and in the afternoon
to the office, and much pleased at night to see my house begin to be clean
after all the dirt.At noon went and
dined with my Lord Crew, where very much made of by him and his lady.Then
to the Theatre, "The Alchymist,"--[Comedy by Ben Jonson, first printed in
1612.]And that being done I met with
little Luellin and Blirton, who took me to a friend's of theirs in
Lincoln's Inn fields, one Mr.Hodges, where we drank great store of
Rhenish wine and were very merry.So I went home, where I found my house
now very clean, which was great content to me.In the morning to church, and my wife not being well,
I went with Sir W. Batten home to dinner, my Lady being out of town, where
there was Sir W. Pen, Captain Allen and his daughter Rebecca, and Mr.After dinner to church all of us and had a very
good sermon of a stranger, and so I and the young company to walk first to
Graye's Inn Walks, where great store of gallants, but above all the ladies
that I there saw, or ever did see, Mrs.Frances Butler (Monsieur
L'Impertinent's sister) is the greatest beauty.Then we went to
Islington, where at the great house I entertained them as well as I could,
and so home with them, and so to my own home and to bed.Pall, who went
this day to a child's christening of Kate Joyce's, staid out all night at
my father's, she not being well.We kept this a holiday, and so went not to the
office at all.At noon my father came to see my
house now it is done, which is now very neat.Williams
(who is come to see my wife, whose soare belly is now grown dangerous as
she thinks) to the ordinary over against the Exchange, where we dined and
had great wrangling with the master of the house when the reckoning was
brought to us, he setting down exceeding high every thing.I home again
and to Sir W. Batten's, and there sat a good while.Up this morning to put my papers in order that are come from my
Lord's, so that now I have nothing there remaining that is mine, which I
have had till now.Goodgroome

first song is "La cruda la bella."He gone my brother Tom comes, with
whom I made even with my father and the two drapers for the cloths I sent
to sea lately.At home all day, in the afternoon came Captain Allen and
his daughter Rebecca and Mr.Hempson, and by and by both Sir Williams, who
sat with me till it was late, and I had a very gallant collation for them.To Westminster about several businesses, then to dine with my Lady
at the Wardrobe, taking Dean Fuller along with me; then home, where I
heard my father had been to find me about special business; so I took
coach and went to him, and found by a letter to him from my aunt that my
uncle Robert is taken with a dizziness in his head, so that they desire my
father to come down to look after his business, by which we guess that he
is very ill, and so my father do think to go to-morrow.Back by water to the office, there till night, and so home to my
musique and then to bed.To my father's, and with him to Mr.Starling's to drink our morning
draft, and there I told him how I would have him speak to my uncle Robert,
when he comes thither, concerning my buying of land, that I could pay
ready money L600 and the rest by L150 per annum, to make up as much as
will buy L50 per annum, which I do, though I not worth above L500 ready
money, that he may think me to be a greater saver than I am.Here I took
my leave of my father, who is going this morning to my uncle upon my
aunt's letter this week that he is not well and so needs my father's help.At noon home, and then with my Lady Batten, Mrs.Thompson, &c., two coaches of us, we went and saw "Bartholomew Fayre"
acted very well, and so home again and staid at Sir W. Batten's late, and
so home to bed.Holden sent me a bever, which cost me L4 5s.[Whilst a hat (see January 28th, 1660-61, ante) cost only 35s.See

trade, and at noon to my Lady and dined with her.So back and to the
office, and there sat till 7 at night, and then Sir W. Pen and I in his
coach went to Moorefields, and there walked, and stood and saw the
wrestling, which I never saw so much of before, between the north and west
countrymen.So home, and this night had our bed set up in our room that
we called the Nursery, where we lay, and I am very much pleased with the
room.By a letter from the Duke complaining of the delay of the ships
that are to be got ready, Sir Williams both and I went to Deptford and
there examined into the delays, and were satisfyed.So back again home
and staid till the afternoon, and then I walked to the Bell at the Maypole
in the Strand, and thither came to me by appointment Mr.Chetwind,
Gregory, and Hartlibb, so many of our old club, and Mr.Kipps, where we
staid and drank and talked with much pleasure till it was late, and so I
walked home and to bed.Chetwind by chewing of tobacco is become very
fat and sallow, whereas he was consumptive, and in our discourse he fell

dinner Sir Williams both and I by water to Whitehall, where having walked
up and down, at last we met with the Duke of York, according to an order

the not sending out of the ships, which we find to be only the wind hath
been against them, and so they could not get out of the river.Hence I to

ladies walk there.Myself humming to myself (which now-a-days is my

weather I am fain to wear a cloth before my belly.DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.JULY

                                   1661

July 1st.This morning I went up and down into the city, to buy several
things, as I have lately done, for my house.Among other things, a fair
chest of drawers for my own chamber, and an Indian gown for myself.The
first cost me 33s., the other 34s.Home and dined there, and Theodore
Goodgroome, my singing master, with me, and then to our singing.After
that to the office, and then home.To Westminster Hall and there walked up and down, it being Term
time.Spoke with several, among others my cozen Roger Pepys, who was
going up to the Parliament House, and inquired whether I had heard from my
father since he went to Brampton, which I had done yesterday, who writes
that my uncle is by fits stupid, and like a man that is drunk, and
sometimes speechless.Home, and after my singing master had done, took
coach and went to Sir William Davenant's Opera; this being the fourth day
that it hath begun, and the first that I have seen it.To-day was acted
the second part of "The Siege of Rhodes."We staid a very great while for
the King and the Queen of Bohemia.And by the breaking of a board over
our heads, we had a great deal of dust fell into the ladies' necks and the
men's hair, which made good sport.The King being come, the scene opened;
which indeed is very fine and magnificent, and well acted, all but the
Eunuch, who was so much out that he was hissed off the stage.Home and
wrote letters to my Lord at sea, and so to bed.Edward Montagu about business of my Lord's,
and so to the Wardrobe, and there dined with my Lady, who is in some
mourning for her brother, Mr.Crew, who died yesterday of the
spotted fever.So home through Duck Lane' to inquire for some Spanish
books, but found none that pleased me.So to the office, and that being
done to Sir W. Batten's with the Comptroller, where we sat late talking
and disputing with Mr.This day my Lady
Batten and my wife were at the burial of a daughter of Sir John Lawson's,
and had rings for themselves and their husbands.At home all the morning; in the afternoon I went to the Theatre, and
there I saw "Claracilla" (the first time I ever saw it), well acted.But
strange to see this house, that used to be so thronged, now empty since
the Opera begun; and so will continue for a while, I believe.Called at my
father's, and there I heard that my uncle Robert--[Robert Pepys, of
Brampton, who died on the following day.]--continues to have his fits of
stupefaction every day for 10 or 12 hours together.From thence to the
Exchange at night, and then went with my uncle Wight to the Mitre and were
merry, but he takes it very ill that my father would go out of town to
Brampton on this occasion and would not tell him of it, which I
endeavoured to remove but could not.Batersby the apothecary
was, who told me that if my uncle had the emerods--[Haemorrhoids or
piles.]--(which I think he had) and that now they are stopped, he will lay
his life that bleeding behind by leeches will cure him, but I am resolved
not to meddle in it.At home, and in the afternoon to the office, and that being done all
went to Sir W. Batten's and there had a venison pasty, and were very
merry.Waked this morning with news, brought me by a messenger on purpose,
that my uncle Robert is dead, and died yesterday; so I rose sorry in some
respect, glad in my expectations in another respect.So I made myself
ready, went and told my uncle Wight, my Lady, and some others thereof, and
bought me a pair of boots in St.Martin's, and got myself ready, and then
to the Post House and set out about eleven and twelve o'clock, taking the
messenger with me that came to me, and so we rode and got well by nine
o'clock to Brampton, where I found my father well.My uncle's corps in a
coffin standing upon joynt-stools in the chimney in the hall; but it begun
to smell, and so I caused it to be set forth in the yard all night, and
watched by two men.My aunt I found in bed in a most nasty ugly pickle,
made me sick to see it.My father and I lay together tonight, I greedy to
see the will, but did not ask to see it till to-morrow.In the morning my father and I walked in the garden and
read the will; where, though he gives me nothing at present till my
father's death, or at least very little, yet I am glad to see that he hath
done so well for us, all, and well to the rest of his kindred.After that
done, we went about getting things, as ribbands and gloves, ready for the
burial.Which in the afternoon was done; where, it being Sunday, all
people far and near come in; and in the greatest disorder that ever I saw,
we made shift to serve them what we had of wine and other things; and then
to carry him to the church, where Mr.Turners
preached a funerall sermon, where he spoke not particularly of him
anything, but that he was one so well known for his honesty, that it spoke
for itself above all that he could say for it.And so made a very good
sermon.Home with some of the company who supped there, and things being
quiet, at night to bed.8th, 9th, Loth, 11th, 12th, 13th.I fell to work, and my father to look
over my uncle's papers and clothes, and continued all this week upon that
business, much troubled with my aunt's base, ugly humours.We had news of
Tom Trice's putting in a caveat against us, in behalf of his mother, to
whom my uncle hath not given anything, and for good reason therein
expressed, which troubled us also.But above all, our trouble is to find
that his estate appears nothing as we expected, and all the world
believes; nor his papers so well sorted as I would have had them, but all
in confusion, that break my brains to understand them.We missed also the
surrenders of his copyhold land, without which the land would not come to
us, but to the heir at law, so that what with this, and the badness of the
drink and the ill opinion I have of the meat, and the biting of the gnats
by night and my disappointment in getting home this week, and the trouble
of sorting all the papers, I am almost out of my wits with trouble, only I
appear the more contented, because I would not have my father troubled.Philips comes home from London, and so we
advised with him and have the best counsel he could give us, but for all
that we were not quiet in our minds.At home, and Robert Barnwell with us, and dined, and
in the evening my father and I walked round Portholme and viewed all the
fields, which was very pleasant.Thence to Hinchingbroke, which is now
all in dirt, because of my Lord's building, which will make it very
magnificent.Back to Brampton, and to supper and to bed.Up by three o'clock this morning, and rode to Cambridge, and was
there by seven o'clock, where, after I was trimmed, I went to Christ
College, and found my brother John at eight o'clock in bed, which vexed
me.Then to King's College chappell, where I found the scholars in their
surplices at the service with the organs, which is a strange sight to what
it used in my time to be here.Fairbrother (whom I met
there) to the Rose tavern, and called for some wine, and there met
fortunately with Mr.Turner of our office, and sent for his wife, and were
very merry (they being come to settle their son here), and sent also for
Mr.Sanchy, of Magdalen, with whom and other gentlemen, friends of his, we
were very merry, and I treated them as well as I could, and so at noon
took horse again, having taken leave of my cozen Angier, and rode to
Impington, where I found my old uncle

     [Talbot Pepys, sixth son of John Pepys of Impington, was born 1583,
     and therefore at this time he was seventy-eight years of age.He
     was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and called to the bar at
     the Middle Temple in 1605.for Cambridge in 1625, and
     Recorder of Cambridge from 1624 to 1660, in which year he was
     succeeded by his son Roger.He died of the plague, March, 1666,
     aged eighty-three.]sitting all alone, like a man out of the world: he can hardly see; but all
things else he do pretty livelyly.John Pepys and him, I
read over the will, and had their advice therein, who, as to the
sufficiency thereof confirmed me, and advised me as to the other parts
thereof.Having done there, I rode to Gravely with much ado to inquire
for a surrender of my uncle's in some of the copyholders' hands there, but
I can hear of none, which puts me into very great trouble of mind, and so
with a sad heart rode home to Brampton, but made myself as cheerful as I
could to my father, and so to bed.16th, 17th, 18th, 19th.These four days we spent in putting things in
order, letting of the crop upon the ground, agreeing with Stankes to have
a care of our business in our absence, and we think ourselves in nothing
happy but in lighting upon him to be our bayly; in riding to Offord and
Sturtlow, and up and down all our lands, and in the evening walking, my
father and I about the fields talking, and had advice from Mr.Moore from
London, by my desire, that the three witnesses of the will being all
legatees, will not do the will any wrong.To-night Serjeant Bernard, I
hear, is come home into the country.My aunt
continuing in her base, hypocritical tricks, which both Jane Perkin (of
whom we make great use), and the maid do tell us every day of.Up to Huntingdon this morning to Sir Robert Bernard, with whom I
met Jaspar Trice.So Sir Robert caused us to sit down together and began
discourse very fairly between us, so I drew out the Will and show it him,
and [he] spoke between us as well as I could desire, but could come to no
issue till Tom Trice comes.Then Sir Robert and I fell to talk about the
money due to us upon surrender from Piggott, L164., which he tells me will
go with debts to the heir at law, which breaks my heart on the other side.Here I staid and dined with Sir Robert Bernard and his lady, my Lady
Digby, a very good woman.After dinner I went into the town and spent the
afternoon, sometimes with Mr.Vinter, Robert Ethell, and many more friends, and at last Mr.Davenport,
Phillips, Jaspar Trice, myself and others at Mother-----over against the
Crown we sat and drank ale and were very merry till 9 at night, and so
broke up.I walked home, and there found Tom Trice come, and he and my
father gone to Goody Gorum's, where I found them and Jaspar Trice got
before me, and Mr.Greene, and there had some calm discourse, but came to
no issue, and so parted.So home and to bed, being now pretty well again
of my left hand, which lately was stung and very much swelled.At home all the morning, putting my papers in order
against my going to-morrow and doing many things else to that end.Had a
good dinner, and Stankes and his wife with us.To my business again in
the afternoon, and in the evening came the two Trices, Mr.Philips, and so we began to argue.At last it came to some agreement that
for our giving of my aunt L10 she is to quit the house, and for other
matters they are to be left to the law, which do please us all, and so we
broke up, pretty well satisfyed.Barnwell and J. Bowles and
supped with us, and after supper away, and so I having taken leave of them
and put things in the best order I could against to-morrow I went to bed.Old William Luffe having been here this afternoon and paid up his bond of
L20, and I did give him into his hand my uncle's surrender of Sturtlow to
me before Mr.Philips, R. Barnwell, and Mr.Pigott, which he did
acknowledge to them my uncle did in his lifetime deliver to him.Up by three, and going by four on my way to London; but the day
proves very cold, so that having put on no stockings but thread ones under
my boots, I was fain at Bigglesworth to buy a pair of coarse woollen ones,
and put them on.So by degrees till I come to Hatfield before twelve
o'clock, where I had a very good dinner with my hostess, at my Lord of
Salisbury's Inn, and after dinner though weary I walked all alone to the
Vineyard, which is now a very beautiful place again; and coming back I met
with Mr.Looker, my Lord's gardener (a friend of Mr.Eglin's), who showed
me the house, the chappell with brave pictures, and, above all, the
gardens, such as I never saw in all my life; nor so good flowers, nor so
great gooseberrys, as big as nutmegs.Back to the inn, and drank with
him, and so to horse again, and with much ado got to London, and set him
up at Smithfield; so called at my uncle Fenner's, my mother's, my Lady's,
and so home, in all which I found all things as well as I could expect.Made visits to Sir W. Pen and Batten.Then to
Westminster, and at the Hall staid talking with Mrs.Michell a good while,
and in the afternoon, finding myself unfit for business, I went to the
Theatre, and saw "Brenoralt," I never saw before.It seemed a good play,
but ill acted; only I sat before Mrs.Palmer, the King's mistress, and
filled my eyes with her, which much pleased me.Then to my father's,
where by my desire I met my uncle Thomas, and discoursed of my uncle's
will to him, and did satisfy [him] as well as I could.So to my uncle
Wight's, but found him out of doors, but my aunt I saw and staid a while,
and so home and to bed.Troubled to hear how proud and idle Pall is
grown, that I am resolved not to keep her.This morning my wife in bed tells me of our being robbed of our
silver tankard, which vexed me all day for the negligence of my people to
leave the door open.My wife and I by water to Whitehall, where I left
her to her business and I to my cozen Thomas Pepys, and discoursed with
him at large about our business of my uncle's will.He can give us no
light at all into his estate, but upon the whole tells me that he do
believe that he has left but little money, though something more than we
have found, which is about L500.Here came Sir G. Lane by chance, seeing
a bill upon the door to hire the house, with whom my coz and I walked all
up and down, and indeed it is a very pretty place, and he do intend to
leave the agreement for the House, which is L400 fine, and L46 rent a year
to me between them.Then to the Wardrobe, but come too late, and so dined
with the servants.And then to my Lady, who do shew my wife and me the
greatest favour in the world, in which I take great content.Home by
water and to the office all the afternoon, which is a great pleasure to me
again, to talk with persons of quality and to be in command, and I give it
out among them that the estate left me is L200 a year in land, besides
moneys, because I would put an esteem upon myself.At night home and to
bed after I had set down my journals ever since my going from London this
journey to this house.This afternoon I hear that my man Will hath lost
his clock with my tankard, at which I am very glad.This morning came my box of papers from Brampton of all my uncle's
papers, which will now set me at work enough.At noon I went to the
Exchange, where I met my uncle Wight, and found him so discontented about
my father (whether that he takes it ill that he has not been acquainted
with things, or whether he takes it ill that he has nothing left him, I
cannot tell), for which I am much troubled, and so staid not long to talk
with him.Thence to my mother's, where I found my wife and my aunt Bell
and Mrs.Ramsey, and great store of tattle there was between the old women
and my mother, who thinks that there is, God knows what fallen to her,
which makes me mad, but it was not a proper time to speak to her of it,
and so I went away with Mr.Moore, and he and I to the Theatre, and saw
"The Jovial Crew," the first time I saw it, and indeed it is as merry and
the most innocent play that ever I saw, and well performed.From thence
home, and wrote to my father and so to bed.Full of thoughts to think of
the trouble that we shall go through before we come to see what will
remain to us of all our expectations.At home all the morning, and walking met with Mr.Hill of Cambridge
at Pope's Head Alley with some women with him whom he took and me into the
tavern there, and did give us wine, and would fain seem to be very knowing
in the affairs of state, and tells me that yesterday put a change to the
whole state of England as to the Church; for the King now would be forced
to favour Presbytery, or the City would leave him: but I heed not what he
says, though upon enquiry I do find that things in the Parliament are in a
great disorder.Moore, and with him to
an ordinary alone and dined, and there he and I read my uncle's will, and
I had his opinion on it, and still find more and more trouble like to
attend it.Back to the office all the afternoon, and that done home for
all night.Having the beginning of this week made a vow to myself to
drink no wine this week (finding it to unfit me to look after business),
and this day breaking of it against my will, I am much troubled for it,
but I hope God will forgive me.Montagu's chamber I heard a Frenchman
play, a friend of Monsieur Eschar's, upon the guitar, most extreme well,
though at the best methinks it is but a bawble.From thence to
Westminster Hall, where it was expected that the Parliament was to have
been adjourned for two or three months, but something hinders it for a day
or two.George Montagu, and advised about a
ship to carry my Lord Hinchingbroke and the rest of the young gentlemen to
France, and they have resolved of going in a hired vessell from Rye, and
not in a man of war.He told me in discourse that my Lord Chancellor is
much envied, and that many great men, such as the Duke of Buckingham and
my Lord of Bristoll, do endeavour to undermine him, and that he believes
it will not be done; for that the King (though he loves him not in the way
of a companion, as he do these young gallants that can answer him in his
pleasures), yet cannot be without him, for his policy and service.From
thence to the Wardrobe, where my wife met me, it being my Lord of
Sandwich's birthday, and so we had many friends here, Mr.Townsend and his
wife, and Captain Ferrers lady and Captain Isham, and were very merry, and
had a good venison pasty.Pargiter, the merchant, was with us also.Townsend was called upon by Captain Cooke: so we three
went to a tavern hard by, and there he did give us a song or two; and
without doubt he hath the best manner of singing in the world.Back to my
wife, and with my Lady Jem.and Pall by water through bridge, and showed
them the ships with great pleasure, and then took them to my house to show
it them (my Lady their mother having been lately all alone to see it and
my wife, in my absence in the country), and we treated them well, and were
very merry.Then back again through bridge, and set them safe at home,
and so my wife and I by coach home again, and after writing a letter to my
father at Brampton, who, poor man, is there all alone, and I have not
heard from him since my coming from him, which troubles me.This morning as my wife and I were going to church,
comes Mrs.Ramsay to see us, so we sent her to church, and we went too,
and came back to dinner, and she dined with us and was wellcome.To
church again in the afternoon, and then come home with us Sir W. Pen, and
drank with us, and then went away, and my wife after him to see his
daughter that is lately come out of Ireland.I staid at home at my book;
she came back again and tells me that whereas I expected she should have
been a great beauty, she is a very plain girl.This evening my wife gives
me all my linen, which I have put up, and intend to keep it now in my own
custody.This morning we began again to sit in the mornings at the office,
but before we sat down.Sir R. Slingsby and I went to Sir R. Ford's to
see his house, and we find it will be very convenient for us to have it
added to the office if he can be got to part with it.Then we sat down
and did business in the office.So home to dinner, and my brother Tom
dined with me, and after dinner he and I alone in my chamber had a great
deal of talk, and I find that unless my father can forbear to make profit
of his house in London and leave it to Tom, he has no mind to set up the
trade any where else, and so I know not what to do with him.After this I
went with him to my mother, and there told her how things do fall out
short of our expectations, which I did (though it be true) to make her
leave off her spending, which I find she is nowadays very free in,
building upon what is left to us by my uncle to bear her out in it, which
troubles me much.While I was here word is brought that my aunt Fenner is
exceeding ill, and that my mother is sent for presently to come to her:
also that my cozen Charles Glassecocke, though very ill himself, is this
day gone to the country to his brother, John Glassecocke, who is a-dying
there.After my singing-master had done with me this morning, I went to
White Hall and Westminster Hall, where I found the King expected to come
and adjourn the Parliament.I found the two Houses at a great difference,
about the Lords challenging their privileges not to have their houses
searched, which makes them deny to pass the House of Commons' Bill for
searching for pamphlets and seditious books.Thence by water to the
Wardrobe (meeting the King upon the water going in his barge to adjourn
the House) where I dined with my Lady, and there met Dr.Thomas Pepys, who
I found to be a silly talking fellow, but very good-natured.So home to
the office, where we met about the business of Tangier this afternoon.Moore, and he and I walked into the City
and there parted.To Fleet Street to find when the Assizes begin at
Cambridge and Huntingdon, in order to my going to meet with Roger Pepys
for counsel.Salisbury, who is now
grown in less than two years' time so great a limner--that he is become
excellent, and gets a great deal of money at it.I took him to Hercules
Pillars to drink, and there came Mr.Whore (whom I formerly have known), a
friend of his to him, who is a very ingenious fellow, and there I sat with
them a good while, and so home and wrote letters late to my Lord and to my
father, and then to bed.Singing-master came to me this morning; then to the office all the
morning.In the afternoon I went to the Theatre, and there I saw "The
Tamer Tamed"  well done.And then home, and prepared to go to Walthamstow
to-morrow.This night I was forced to borrow L40 of Sir W. Batten.DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.AUGUST
                                   1661

August 1st.This morning Sir Williams both, and my wife and I and Mrs.Margarett Pen (this first time that I have seen her since she came from
Ireland) went by coach to Walthamstow, a-gossiping to Mrs.Browne, where I
did give her six silver spoons--[But not the porringer of silver.See May
29th, 1661.--M.Here we had a venison pasty, brought hot
from London, and were very merry.Only I hear how nurse's husband has
spoken strangely of my Lady Batten how she was such a man's whore, who
indeed is known to leave her her estate, which we would fain have
reconciled to-day, but could not and indeed I do believe that the story is
true.Pepys dined with
me, and after dinner my brother Tom came to me and then I made myself
ready to get a-horseback for Cambridge.So I set out and rode to Ware,
this night, in the way having much discourse with a fellmonger,--[A dealer
in hides.]--a Quaker, who told me what a wicked man he had been all his
life-time till within this two years.Here I lay, and

3rd.Got up early the next morning and got to Barkway, where I staid and
drank, and there met with a letter-carrier of Cambridge, with whom I rode
all the way to Cambridge, my horse being tired, and myself very wet with
rain.I went to the Castle Hill, where the judges were at the Assizes;
and I staid till Roger Pepys rose and went with him, and dined with his
brother, the Doctor, and Claxton at Trinity Hall.Then parted, and I went
to the Rose, and there with Mr.Pechell, Sanchy, and others, sat and drank
till night and were very merry, only they tell me how high the old doctors
are in the University over those they found there, though a great deal
better scholars than themselves; for which I am very sorry, and, above
all, Dr.At night I took horse, and rode with Roger Pepys and
his two brothers to Impington, and there with great respect was led up by
them to the best chamber in the house, and there slept.Got up, and by and by walked into the orchard with my
cozen Roger, and there plucked some fruit, and then discoursed at large
about the business I came for, that is, about my uncle's will, in which he
did give me good satisfaction, but tells me I shall meet with a great deal
of trouble in it.However, in all things he told me what I am to expect
and what to do.To church, and had a good plain sermon, and my uncle
Talbot went with us and at our coming in the country-people all rose with
so much reverence; and when the parson begins, he begins "Right
worshipfull and dearly beloved" to us.Home to dinner, which was very
good, and then to church again, and so home and to walk up and down and so
to supper, and after supper to talk about publique matters, wherein Roger
Pepys--(who I find a very sober man, and one whom I do now honour more
than ever before for this discourse sake only) told me how basely things
have been carried in Parliament by the young men, that did labour to
oppose all things that were moved by serious men.That they are the most
prophane swearing fellows that ever he heard in his life, which makes him
think that they will spoil all, and bring things into a warr again if they
can.Early to Huntingdon, but was fain to stay a great while at Stanton
because of the rain, and there borrowed a coat of a man for 6d., and so he
rode all the way, poor man, without any.Staid at Huntingdon for a
little, but the judges are not come hither: so I went to Brampton, and
there found my father very well, and my aunt gone from the house, which I
am glad of, though it costs us a great deal of money, viz.Here I
dined, and after dinner took horse and rode to Yelling, to my cozen
Nightingale's, who hath a pretty house here, and did learn of her all she
could tell me concerning my business, and has given me some light by her
discourse how I may get a surrender made for Graveley lands.Hence to
Graveley, and there at an alehouse met with Chancler and Jackson (one of
my tenants for Cotton closes) and another with whom I had a great deal of
discourse, much to my satisfaction.Hence back again to Brampton and
after supper to bed, being now very quiet in the house, which is a content
to us.Phillips, but lost my labour, he lying at
Huntingdon last night, so I went back again and took horse and rode
thither, where I staid with Thos.Philips drinking till
noon, and then Tom Trice and I to Brampton, where he to Goody Gorum's and
I home to my father, who could discern that I had been drinking, which he
did never see or hear of before, so I eat a bit of dinner and went with
him to Gorum's, and there talked with Tom Trice, and then went and took
horse for London, and with much ado, the ways being very bad, got to
Baldwick, and there lay and had a good supper by myself.The landlady
being a pretty woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her husband
being there.Before supper I went to see the church, which is a very
handsome church, but I find that both here, and every where else that I
come, the Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen.Called up at three o'clock, and was a-horseback by four; and as I
was eating my breakfast I saw a man riding by that rode a little way upon
the road with me last night; and he being going with venison in his
pan-yards to London, I called him in and did give him his breakfast with
me, and so we went together all the way.At Hatfield we bayted and walked
into the great house through all the courts; and I would fain have stolen
a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which troubled me.To
horse again, and by degrees with much ado got to London, where I found all
well at home and at my father's and my Lady's, but no news yet from my
Lord where he is.At my Lady's (whither I went with Dean Fuller, who came
to my house to see me just as I was come home) I met with Mr.Moore, who
told me at what a loss he was for me, for to-morrow is a Seal day at the
Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord
Privy Seal, at the Seal.Early in the mornink to Whitehall, but my Lord Privy Seal came not
all the morning.Moore and I to the Wardrobe to dinner, where
my Lady and all merry and well.Back again to the Privy Seal; but my Lord
comes not all the afternoon, which made me mad and gives all the world
reason to talk of his delaying of business, as well as of his severity and
ill using of the Clerks of the Privy Seal.Pierce's brother (the souldier) to the tavern
next the Savoy, and there staid and drank with them.Mage, and discoursing of musique Mons.Eschar spoke so much against the
English and in praise of the French that made him mad, and so he went
away.After a stay with them a little longer we parted and I home.To the office, where word is brought me by a son-in-law of Mr.Pierces; the purser, that his father is a dying and that he desires that I
would come to him before he dies.So I rose from the table and went,
where I found him not so ill as I thought that he had been ill.So I did
promise to be a friend to his wife and family if he should die, which was
all he desired of me, but I do believe he will recover.Back again to the
office, where I found Sir G. Carteret had a day or two ago invited some of
the officers to dinner to-day at Deptford.So at noon, when I heard that
he was a-coming, I went out, because I would see whether he would send to
me or no to go with them; but he did not, which do a little trouble me
till I see how it comes to pass.Although in other things I am glad of it
because of my going again to-day to the Privy Seal.I dined at home, and
having dined news is brought by Mr.Hater that his wife is now falling
into labour, so he is come for my wife, who presently went with him.I to
White Hall, where, after four o'clock, comes my Lord Privy Seal, and so we
went up to his chamber over the gate at White Hall, where he asked me what
deputacon I had from My Lord.I told him none; but that I am sworn my
Lord's deputy by both of the Secretarys, which did satisfy him.Moore to read over all the bills as is the manner, and all
ended very well.So that I see the Lyon is not so fierce as he is
painted.Eschar (who all this afternoon had been
waiting at the Privy Seal for the Warrant for L5,000 for my Lord of
Sandwich's preparation for Portugal) and I took some wine with us and went
to visit la belle Pierce, who we find very big with child, and a pretty
lady, one Mrs.Clifford, with her, where we staid and were extraordinary
merry.From thence I took coach to my father's, where I found him come
home this day from Brampton (as I expected) very well, and after some
discourse about business and it being very late I took coach again home,
where I hear by my wife that Mrs.Hater is not yet delivered, but
continues in her pains.This morning came the maid that my wife hath lately hired for a
chamber maid.She is very ugly, so that I cannot care for her, but
otherwise she seems very good.But however she do come about three weeks
hence, when my wife comes back from Brampton, if she go with my father.By
and by came my father to my house, and so he and I went and found out my
uncle Wight at the Coffee House, and there did agree with him to meet the
next week with my uncle Thomas and read over the Captain's will before
them both for their satisfaction.Having done with him I went to my
Lady's and dined with her, and after dinner took the two young gentlemen
and the two ladies and carried them and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre,
and shewed them "The merry Devill of Edmunton," which is a very merry
play, the first time I ever saw it, which pleased me well.And that being
done I took them all home by coach to my house and there gave them fruit
to eat and wine.So by water home with them, and so home myself.To our own church in the forenoon, and in the
afternoon to Clerkenwell Church, only to see the two

     [A comedy acted at the Globe, and first printed in 1608.In the
     original entry in the Stationers' books it is said to be by T. B.,
     which may stand for Tony or Anthony Brewer.The play has been
     attributed without authority both to Shakespeare and to Drayton.]fayre Botelers;--[Mrs.--and I happened to
be placed in the pew where they afterwards came to sit, but the pew by
their coming being too full, I went out into the next, and there sat, and
had my full view of them both, but I am out of conceit now with them,
Colonel Dillon being come back from Ireland again, and do still court
them, and comes to church with them, which makes me think they are not
honest.Hence to Graye's-Inn walks, and there staid a good while; where I
met with Ned Pickering, who told me what a great match of hunting of a
stagg the King had yesterday; and how the King tired all their horses, and
come home with not above two or three able to keep pace with him.So to
my father's, and there supped, and so home.At home in the afternoon, and had
notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill, which I fear is with the
fruit that I did give them on Saturday last at my house: so in the evening
I went thither and there found him very ill, and in great fear of the
smallpox.I supped with my Lady, and did consult about him, but we find
it best to let him lie where he do; and so I went home with my heart full
of trouble for my Lord Hinchinabroke's sickness, and more for my Lord
Sandwich's himself, whom we are now confirmed is sick ashore at Alicante,
who, if he should miscarry, God knows in what condition would his family
be.I dined to-day with my Lord Crew, who is now at Sir H. Wright's,
while his new house is making fit for him, and he is much troubled also at
these things.To the Privy Seal in the morning, then to the Wardrobe to dinner,
where I met my wife, and found my young Lord very ill.So my Lady intends
to send her other three sons, Sidney, Oliver, and John, to my house, for
fear of the small-pox.After dinner I went to my father's, where I found
him within, and went up to him, and there found him settling his papers
against his removal, and I took some old papers of difference between me
and my wife and took them away.After that Pall being there I spoke to my
father about my intention not to keep her longer for such and such
reasons, which troubled him and me also, and had like to have come to some
high words between my mother and me, who is become a very simple woman.Cordery to take her leave of my father, thinking
he was to go presently into the country, and will have us to come and see
her before he do go.Then my father and I went forth to Mr.Rawlinson's,
where afterwards comes my uncle Thomas and his two sons, and then my uncle
Wight by appointment of us all, and there we read the will and told them
how things are, and what our thoughts are of kindness to my uncle Thomas
if he do carry himself peaceable, but otherwise if he persist to keep his
caveat up against us.So he promised to withdraw it, and seemed to be
very well contented with things as they are.After a while drinking, we
paid all and parted, and so I home, and there found my Lady's three sons
come, of which I am glad that I am in condition to do her and my Lord any
service in this kind, but my mind is yet very much troubled about my Lord
of Sandwich's health, which I am afeard of.This morning Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen and I, waited upon the
Duke of York in his chamber, to give him an account of the condition of
the Navy for lack of money, and how our own very bills are offered upon
the Exchange, to be sold at 20 in the 100 loss.He is much troubled at
it, and will speak to the King and Council of it this morning.So I went
to my Lady's and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke somewhat
better.After dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Alchymist;" and there I saw Sir W. Pen, who took us when the play was
done and carried the Captain to Paul's and set him down, and me home with
him, and he and I to the Dolphin, but not finding Sir W. Batten there, we
went and carried a bottle of wine to his house, and there sat a while and
talked, and so home to bed.Creed of
the 15th of July last, that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain
(which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver,
and is now in hopes to go aboard in a day or two, which do give me mighty
great comfort.To the Privy Seal and Whitehall, up and down, and at noon Sir W.
Pen carried me to Paul's, and so I walked to the Wardrobe and dined with
my Lady, and there told her, of my Lord's sickness (of which though it
hath been the town-talk this fortnight, she had heard nothing) and
recovery, of which she was glad, though hardly persuaded of the latter.I
found my Lord Hinchingbroke better and better, and the worst past.Thence
to the Opera, which begins again to-day with "The Witts," never acted yet
with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there (who dined
to-day with Sir H. Finch, reader at the Temple, in great state); and
indeed it is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes.So home and was
overtaken by Sir W. Pen in his coach, who has been this afternoon with my
Lady Batten, &c., at the Theatre.So I followed him to the Dolphin, where
Sir W. Batten was, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made
shift to fuddle Mr.At the office all the morning, though little to be done; because
all our clerks are gone to the buriall of Tom Whitton, one of the
Controller's clerks, a very ingenious, and a likely young man to live, as
any in the Office.But it is such a sickly time both in City and country
every where (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless
it was in a plague-time.Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr.Nichols, Dean
of Paul's; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.Dined at
home with the children and were merry, and my father with me; who after
dinner he and I went forth about business.John Williams at an alehouse, where we staid till past nine at
night, in Shoe Lane, talking about our country business, and I found him
so well acquainted with the matters of Gravely that I expect he will be of
great use to me.I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon
the point of death.At the Privy Seal, where we had a seal this morning.Then met with
Ned Pickering, and walked with him into St.James's Park (where I had not
been a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.And, in our discourse, he was very forward to complain and to speak loud
of the lewdness and beggary of the Court, which I am sorry to hear, and
which I am afeard will bring all to ruin again.So he and I to the
Wardrobe to dinner, and after dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera,
and saw "The Witts" again, which I like exceedingly.The Queen of Bohemia
was here, brought by my Lord Craven.So the Captain and I and another to
the Devil tavern and drank, and so by coach home.Troubled in mind that I
cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of
plays.We have been at a great loss a great while for a vessel that I
sent about a month ago with, things of my Lord's to Lynn, and cannot till
now hear of them, but now we are told that they are put into Soale Bay,
but to what purpose I know not.To our own church in the morning and so home to
dinner, where my father and Dr.Tom Pepys came to me to dine, and were
very merry.Sidney to my Lady to see
my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now pretty well again, and sits up and walks
about his chamber.So I went to White Hall, and there hear that my Lord
General Monk continues very ill: so I went to la belle Pierce and sat with
her; and then to walk in St.James's Park, and saw great variety of fowl
which I never saw before and so home.At night fell to read in "Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity," which Mr.Moore did give me last Wednesday very
handsomely bound; and which I shall read with great pains and love for his
sake.At the office all the morning; at noon the children are sent for by
their mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them
by coach, and she to my father's and dines there, and from thence with
them to see Mrs.Cordery, who do invite them before my father goes into
the country, and thither I should have gone too but that I am sent for to
the Privy Seal, and there I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor's

     [This "thing" was probably one of those large grants which Clarendon
     quietly, or, as he himself says, "without noise or scandal,"
     procured from the king.Besides lands and manors, Clarendon states
     at one time that the king gave him a "little billet into his hand,
     that contained a warrant of his own hand-writing to Sir Stephen Fox
     to pay to the Chancellor the sum of L20,000,--[approximately 10
     million dollars in the year 2000]--of which nobody could have
     notice."In 1662 he received L5,000 out of the money voted to the
     king by the Parliament of Ireland, as he mentions in his vindication
     of himself against the impeachment of the Commons; and we shall see
     that Pepys, in February, 1664, names another sum of L20,000 given to
     the Chancellor to clear the mortgage upon Clarendon Park; and this
     last sum, it was believed, was paid from the money received from
     France by the sale of Dunkirk.--B.]to be sealed this afternoon, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House,
where severall Lords are met in Council this afternoon.And while I am
waiting there, in comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet
cap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.Here I staid till at last, hearing that my Lord Privy Seal had not the
seal here, Mr.Moore and I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at
an alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came
to his house, and so we to him and examined and sealed the thing, and so
homewards, but when we came to look for our coach we found it gone, so we
were fain to walk home afoot and saved our money.We met with a companion
that walked with us, and coming among some trees near the Neate houses, he
began to whistle, which did give us some suspicion, but it proved that he
that answered him was Mr.Marsh (the Lutenist) and his wife, and so we all
walked to Westminster together, in our way drinking a while at my cost,
and had a song of him, but his voice is quite lost.So walked home, and
there I found that my Lady do keep the children at home, and lets them not
come any more hither at present, which a little troubles me to lose their
company.At the office in the morning and all the afternoon at home to put
my papers in order.This day we come to some agreement with Sir R. Ford
for his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.This morning by appointment I went to my father, and after a
morning draft he and I went to Dr.Williams, but he not within we went to
Mrs.Whately's, who lately offered a proposal of
her sister for a wife for my brother Tom, and with her we discoursed about
and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her, and in
the meantime went to Will.Joyce's and to an alehouse, and drank a good
while together, he being very angry that his father Fenner will give him
and his brother no more for mourning than their father did give him and my
aunt at their mother's death, and a very troublesome fellow I still find
him to be, that his company ever wearys me.From thence about two o'clock
to Mrs.Whately's, but she being going to dinner we went to Whitehall and
there staid till past three, and here I understand by Mr.Moore that my
Lady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very
well.Whately's again, and there were well received, and she
desirous to have the thing go forward, only is afeard that her daughter is
too young and portion not big enough, but offers L200 down with her.The
girl is very well favoured,, and a very child, but modest, and one I think
will do very well for my brother: so parted till she hears from Hatfield
from her husband, who is there; but I find them very desirous of it, and
so am I. Hence home to my father's, and I to the Wardrobe, where I supped
with the ladies, and hear their mother is well and the young child, and so
home.To the Privy Seal, and sealed; so home at noon, and there took my
wife by coach to my uncle Fenner's, where there was both at his house and
the Sessions, great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I
wonder at; and the house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were
fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.Then
back again and to church, my father's family being all in mourning, doing
him the greatest honour, the world believing that he did give us it: so to
church, and staid out the sermon, and then with my aunt Wight, my wife,
and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a
Westphalia ham, and so home and to bed.This morning I went to my father's, and there found him and my
mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become
very simple and unquiet.Williams, and found him
within, and there we sat and talked a good while, and from him to Tom
Trice's to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him
fair we examined my uncle's will before him and Dr.Williams, and had them
sign the copy and so did give T. Trice the original to prove, so he took
my father and me to one of the judges of the Court, and there we were
sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.Williams and I to a cook's where we eat a bit of mutton, and away, I to W.
Joyce's, where by appointment my wife was, and I took her to the Opera,
and shewed her "The Witts," which I had seen already twice, and was most
highly pleased with it.So with my wife to the Wardrobe to see my Lady,
and then home.At the office all the morning and did business; by and by we are
called to Sir W. Batten's to see the strange creature that Captain Holmes
hath brought with him from Guiny; it is a great baboon, but so much like a
man in most things, that though they say there is a species of them, yet I
cannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon.I do
believe that it already understands much English, and I am of the mind it
might be taught to speak or make signs.Hence the Comptroller and I to
Sir Rd.Ford's and viewed the house again, and are come to a complete end
with him to give him L200 per an.Isham
inquiring for me to take his leave of me, he being upon his voyage to
Portugal, and for my letters to my Lord which are not ready.But I took
him to the Mitre and gave him a glass of sack, and so adieu, and then
straight to the Opera, and there saw "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," done
with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton

     [Sir William Davenant introduced the use of scenery.The character
     of Hamlet was one of Betterton's masterpieces.Downes tells us that
     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the
     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with
Mr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul's churchyard, and there
staid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and
so to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with
my wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very
good and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of
restitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look
something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and
is not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at
all.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country
to-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to
us, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep
her no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to
yield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay
there awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my
father and I to my uncle Wight's, and there supped, and he took his leave
of them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul's and there parted, and
I home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do
trouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who
has this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the
country to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear
weeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by
Pall's coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all
things, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave
her 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her
going.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting
things even, and casting up my father's accounts, and upon the whole I
find that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but
L45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a
condition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle
Robert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to
my mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my
Lady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"
wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil
tavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my
father was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and
sat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for
a wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he
will do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met
with a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at
my father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all
will be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and
his son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof
to anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at
home I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of
his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was
twice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out
of doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane
tavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to
Portugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw
till he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in
their way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's
bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of
the L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will
not do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to
enquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and
then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to
dinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but
methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a
poor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,
were; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the
while.Hence to my father's, and there staid to
talk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my
wife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and
would have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but
am afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands
of him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife
all the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with
about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that
we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that
stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my
aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my
bookseller, and there staid till four o'clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner's.So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but
that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where
there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we
friendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a
little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he
being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the
children, and after dinner up to my Lady's bedside, and talked and laughed
a good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,
which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so
nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind
to be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she
knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd
further acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the
foolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin
to me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and
there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or
two come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that
I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting
from thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards
Ludgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met
with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,
at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be
brought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ's Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering
bought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,
which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which
pleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,
and there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk
with her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so
much innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,
by means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather
to the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a
manner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling
of it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity
and harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so
home, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as
Fenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so
parted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all
the work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away
into the country with my mother.My Lord
Sandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at
Alicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much
business and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,
and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must
labour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow
a great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave
things in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now
left to keep my father's trade, in which I have great fears that he will
miscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill
condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of
drinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end
of it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet
with do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or
satisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence

     [A voluntary contribution made by the subjects to their sovereign.Upon this occasion the clergy alone gave L33,743: See May 31st,
     1661.--B]

proves so little, and an occasion of so much discontent every where; that
it had better it had never been set up.We are
at our Office quiet, only for lack of money all things go to rack.Our
very bills offered to be sold upon the Exchange at 10 per cent.We
are upon getting Sir R. Ford's house added to our Office.But I see so
many difficulties will follow in pleasing of one another in the dividing
of it, and in becoming bound personally to pay the rent of L200 per annum,
that I do believe it will yet scarce come to pass.The season very sickly
every where of strange and fatal fevers.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:

[Transcriber's Note:

Alternative spellings retained.Luard for the
Master of the Rolls.Matthew Paris also (879, Wats) speaks of him as
“episcopus Lincolniensis Robertus, cui comes tamquam patri confessori
exstitit familiarissimus.” This however was in the earlier part of
Simon’s career, before the war had broken out.The share of Bishop
Walter of Cantilupe, who was present at Evesham and absolved the Earl
and his followers, will be found in most of the Chronicles of the time.It comes out well in the riming Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (ii.558):—

  “Þe bissop Water of Wurcetre asoiled hom alle pere
   And prechede hom, þat hii adde of deþ þe lasse fere.”

This writer says of the battle of Evesham:—

  “Suich was þe morþre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was).”

(34) This letter, addressed in 1247 to Pope Innocent the Fourth, will
be found in Matthew Paris (721, Wats).It is written in the name of
“universitas cleri et populi per provinciam Cantuariensem constituti,”
and it ends, “quia communitas nostra sigillum non habet, præsentes
literas signo communitatis civitatis Londinensis vestræ sanctitati
mittimus consignatas.” Another letter in the same form follows to the
Cardinals.There are two earlier letters in 1245 and 1246 (Matthew
Paris, 666, 700), the former from the “magnates et universitas regni
Angliæ,” the other in the name of Richard Earl of Cornwall (afterwards
King of the Romans), Simon Earl of Leicester, and other Earls, “et alii
totius regni Angliæ Barones, proceres, et magnates, et nobiles portuum
maris habitatores, necnon et clerus et populus universus.” The distinct
mention of the Cinque Ports, whose representatives in Parliament are
still called Barons—the “nobiles” of the letter—should be noticed.(35) The writer of the Gesta Stephani(3) distinctly attributes the
election of Stephen to the citizens of London: “Majores igitur natu,
consultuque quique provectiores, concilium coegere, deque regni
statu, pro arbitrio suo, utilia in commune providentes, ad regem
eligendum unanimiter conspiravere.” He then goes on with the details
of the election.He is borne out by the Chronicle 1135: “Stephne de
Blais com to Lundene and te Lundenisce folc him underfeng;” and by
William of Malmesbury, Historia Novella, i.11: “A Londoniensibus et
Wintoniensibus in Regem exceptus est.” So again when the Legate, Henry
Bishop of Winchester, holds a council for the election of the Empress
Matilda, the citizens of London were summoned, and it is distinctly
said that they held the rank of nobles or barons: “Londonienses
(qui sunt quasi optimates, pro magnitudine civitatis, in Anglia).”
“Londonienses, qui præcipui habebantur in Anglia, sicut proceres”
(Historia Novella, iii.All this is exactly like the earlier
elections of Kings before the Conquest.(36) The words of the Charter 12-14 (Stubbs, 290) are: “Nullum
scutagium vel auxilium ponatur in regno nostro, nisi per commune
consilium regni nostri, nisi ad corpus nostrum redimendum, etc.....
Et ad habendum commune consilium regni, de auxilio assidendo aliter
quam in tribus casibus prædictis, vel de scutagio assidendo, summoneri
faciemus archiepiscopos, episcopos, abbates, comites, et majores
barones, sigillatim per litteras nostras; et præterea faciemus
summoneri in generali, per vicecomites et ballivos nostros, omnes
illos qui de nobis tenent in capite.” This is exactly like the entry
in the Chronicle (1123), describing the summoning of a Witenagemót by
Henry the First: “Da sone Þæræfter sende se kyng hise write ofer eal
Englalande, and bed hise biscopes and hise abbates and hise Þeignes
ealle Þet hi scolden cumen to his gewitenemot on Candelmesse deig to
Gleawceastre him togeanes; and hi swa diden.”

(37) These first glimmerings of parliamentary representation were
carefully traced out by Hallam (Middle Ages, ii.They can
now be more fully studied in the work of Professor Stubbs.On the
summons in 1213 of four men for each shire besides “milites et barones”
(“quatuor discretos homines de comitatu tuo illuc venire facias”),
the Professor remarks (278): “It is the first writ in which the ‘four
discreet men’ of the county appear as representatives; the first
instance of the summoning of the folkmoot to a general assembly by the
machinery already used for judicial purposes.”

(38) On this subject the eighth chapter of Sir Francis Palgrave’s
English Commonwealth should be studied.(39) For the whole career of Simon I must again refer generally to
Pauli and Blaauw.The great writ itself, dated at Worcester, December
14th, 1264, will be found in Rymer’s Fœdera, i.It has often
been noticed how small is the number of Earls and other lay Barons, and
how unusually large the number of churchmen, who are summoned to this
Parliament.The whole list will be found in Rymer.The parts of the
writ which concern us stand thus:

“Item mandatum est singulis vicecomitibus per Angliam; quod venire
faciant duos milites de legalioribus, probioribus et discretioribus
militibus singulorum comitatuum, ad Regem London’ in octab’ prædictis,
in formâ supradictâ.“Item in formâ prædictâ scribitur civibus Ebor’, civibus Lincoln’,
et cæteris burgis Angliæ; quod mittant in formâ prædictâ duos de
discretioribus, legalioribus, et probioribus, tam civibus, quam
burgensibus suis.“Item in formâ prædictâ mandatum est baronibus, et probis hominibus
Quinque Portuum.”

“This is often regarded as the origin of popular representation; but it
is not in any sense entitled to that praise.The novelty was simply the
assembling the representatives of the towns in conjunction with those
of the counties; this was now done for the first time for the purpose
of the national council.” Stubbs, 401.(40) The account of this most remarkable trial, held on June 11th,
1252, is given in a letter from Simon’s intimate friend the famous
Franciscan Adam Marsh (de Marisco) to Bishop Robert Grosseteste.Brewer’s Monumenta Franciscana, p.122,
and there is an English translation in the Appendix to Mrs.Green’s
Life of Countess Eleanor, English Princesses, ii.Simon’s
witnesses, knights and citizens, come “muniti litteris patentibus
communitatis Burdegalensis, in quâ quasi totum robur Vasconiæ ad
distringendum hostiles et fideles protegendum consistere dignoscitur,”
setting forth how good Simon’s government was in every way, and how
those who brought charges against him did it only because his strict
justice had put a check on their misdoings.We may compare the words of
the great poetical manifesto (Political Songs, 76).“Seductorem nominant S. atque fallacem,
   Facta sed examinant probantque veracem.”

(41) For the Londoners at Lewes let us take the account of an enemy.Thomas Wykes (148) tells us how the Earl set out, “glorians in virtute
sua congregata baronum multitudine copiosa, Londoniensium innumerabili
agmine circumcinctus, quia legitur stultorum infinitus est numerus.”
Presently we read how the “Londoniensium innumera multitudo, bellorum
ignara,” were put to flight by the Lord Edward very much after the
manner of Prince Rupert.(42) On the religious reverence paid to Earl Waltheof, see Norman
Conquest, ii.I have there referred to the office of Thomas of
Lancaster, which will be found in Political Songs, 268.Some of the
pieces are what we should think most daring parodies of parts of the
Church Service, but we may be sure that what was intended was reverence
and not irreverence.There is another parody of the same kind in honour
of Earl Thomas, a little earlier back in the volume, p.It was a
matter of course that Thomas of Lancaster should be likened to Thomas
of Canterbury.“Gaude, Thoma, ducum decus, lucerna Lancastriæ,
   Qui per necem imitaris Thomam Cantuariæ;
   Cujus caput conculcatur pacem ob ecclesiæ,
   Atque tuum detruncatur causa pacis Angliæ.(43) Let us take a Latin, a French, and an English specimen of the
poems in which Simon’s death was lamented and his intercession implored.“Salve, Symon Montis Fortis,
     Totius flos militiæ,
   Durus pœnas passus mortis,
     Protector gentis Angliæ.Sunt de sanctis inaudita
   Cunctis passis in hac vita,
     Quemquam passum talia;
   Manus, pedes, amputari,
   Caput, corpus, vulnerari,
     Abscidi virilia.Sis pro nobis intercessor
   Apud Deum, qui defensor
     In terris exstiteras.”—(Political Songs, 124.)The French poem which follows directly in the collection is too long to
copy in full.This is perhaps the most remarkable stanza, in which we
again find the comparison with Thomas of Canterbury:—

  “Mès par sa mort, le cuens Mountfort conquist la victorie,
   Come ly martyr de Caunterbyr, finist sa vie;
   Ne voleit pas li bon Thomas qe perist seinte Eglise,
   Le cuens auxi se combati, e morust sauntz feyntise.Ore est ocys la flur de pris, qe taunt savoit de guerre,
   Ly quens Montfort, sa dure mort molt emplorra la terre.”

In this poem there is not, as in the Latin one, any direct prayer to
the martyred Earl, but in the last stanza we read:—

  “Sire Simoun ly prodhom, e sa compagnie,
   En joie vont en ciel amount, en pardurable vie.”

The only English piece on these wars belongs to an earlier date,
namely, the satirical poem against King Richard, how the one English
Augustus

  “Makede him a castel of a mulne post;”

but we get verses on Simon’s death in the Chronicle of Robert of
Gloucester (ii.559):—

  “& sir Simond was aslawe, & is folk al to grounde,
   More murÞre are nas in so lute stounde.Vor Þere was werst Simond de Mountfort aslawe, alas!& sir Henri is sone, Þat so gentil knizt was.*       *       *       *       *

   & among alle oÞere mest reuÞe it was ido,
   Þat sir Simon Þe olde man demembred was so.”

He then goes on with the details of the dismemberment, of which a
picture may be seen opposite p.Blaauw’s book, and then goes
on with the lines which I have before quoted:—

  “Suich was Þe morÞre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was),
   And Þer wiÞ Jesu Crist wel vuele ipaied was,
   As he ssewede bitokninge grisliche and gode,
   As it vel of him sulue, Þo he deide on Þe rode,
   Þat Þoru al Þe middelerd derk hede Þer was inou.”

(44) On the occasional and irregular summoning of the borough members
between 1265 and 1295 see Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.160, 165, and
more fully in Stubbs, Select Charters, 420, 427, where the gradual
developement of parliamentary representation is treated as it has
never been treated before, with a full citation of the authorities.The language in which the chroniclers speak of the constitution of the
early Parliaments of Edward is as vague as that in which our ancient
Gemóts are described.Sometimes they speak only of “proceres” and the
like; sometimes they distinctly mention the popular element.Curiously
enough, the official language is sometimes more popular than that of
the annalists.Thus the Winchester Annals, recording the Statute of
Westminster in 1273, call the Assembly which passed it a “communis
convocatio omnium magnatum regni,” though it incidentally implies the
presence of other persons, “quamplures de regno qui aliqua feoda de
corona regia tenuerunt.” But the preamble of the Statute itself records
the “assentement des erceveskes, eveskes, abbes, priurs, contes,
barons, et _la communaute de la tere_ ileokes somons.” So in the later
Parliament of the same year the Annals speak only of the “communis
consensus archiepiscoporum, comitum, et baronum,” while the official
description is “prælati, comites, barones, et alii de regno nostro.”
But in an earlier Assembly, that held in 1273, before Edward had come
back to England, the same Winchester Annals tell us how “convenerunt
archiepiscopi et episcopi, comites et barones, et _de quolibet comitatu
quatuor milites et de qualibet civitate quatuor_.” This and the
summons to the Parliament of 1285, which sat in judgement on David
of Wales (Stubbs, 453, 457), seem the most distinct cases of borough
representation earlier than 1295, since which time the summoning of the
borough members has gone on regularly.Stubbs’
remarks on the Assemblies of “the transitionary period” in pp.465, 469
should be specially studied.(45) The history of the resistance of these two Earls to King Edward,
which led to the great Confirmation of the Charters in 1297, will be
found in all the histories of the time, old and new.See also Stubbs,
431, 479.I feel no difficulty in reconciling respect for Edward with
respect for the men who withstood him.The case is well put by Stubbs,
34, 35.(46) The exact value of the document commonly known as the statute “De
Tallagio non concedendo” is discussed by Professor Stubbs, p.It
is perhaps safest to look on it, like many of the earlier collections
of laws, not indeed as an actual statute, but as good evidence of a
principle which, from the time of the Confirmation of the Charters, has
been universally received.The words are—

“Nullum tallagium vel auxilium per nos vel hæredes nostros de cetero in
regno nostro imponatur seu levetur, sine voluntate et assensu communi
archiepiscoporum, episcoporum et aliorum prælatorum, comitum, baronum,
militum, burgensium, et aliorum liberorum hominum in regno nostro.”
This, it will be seen, is the same provision which I have already
quoted (see above, Note 36) from the Great Charter of John, but which
was left out in the Charter in the form in which it was confirmed by
Henry the Third.See Stubbs, 330, 332, 336.(47) I have said this before in Historical Essays, p.On the
strongly marked legal character of Edward’s age, and especially of
Edward’s own mind, see Stubbs, 417.(48) The great statute of treason of 25 Edward the Third (see the
Revised Edition of the Statutes, i.185) secures the life of the King,
his wife, and his eldest son, and the chastity of his wife, his eldest
daughter, and his eldest son’s wife.But the personal privilege goes no
further.As the Law of England knows no classes of men except peers and
commoners, it follows that the younger children of the King—the eldest
is born Duke of Cornwall—are, in strictness of speech, commoners,
unless they are personally raised to the peerage.I am not aware that
either case has ever arisen, but I conceive that there is nothing to
hinder a King’s son, not being a peer, from voting at an election, or
from being chosen to the House of Commons, and I conceive that, if
he committed a crime, he would be tried by a jury.Mere precedence
and titles have nothing to do with the matter, though probably a good
deal of confusion arises from the very modern fashion—one might almost
say the modern vulgarism—of calling all the children of the King or
Queen “Princes” and “Princesses.” As late as the time of George the
Second uncourtly Englishmen were still found who eschewed the foreign
innovation, and who spoke of the Lady Caroline and the Lady Emily, as
their fathers had done before them.Another modern vulgarism is that of using the word “royal”—“royal
visit,” “royal marriage,” and so forth—when there is no royalty in the
case, the person spoken of being a subject, perhaps a commoner.(49) On the parliamentary position of the clergy see Hallam, Middle
Ages, ii.And as far as the reign of Edward the First is
concerned, see the series of summonses in Stubbs, 442.(50) On this important constitutional change, which was made in
1664, without any Act of Parliament, but by a mere verbal agreement
between Archbishop Sheldon and Lord Chancellor Clarendon, see Hallam,
Constitutional History, ii.(51) This is true on the whole, especially at the beginning of the
institution of the States General, though there were also _roturiers_
who were the immediate burgesses of the King.See Thierry, History
of the Tiers Etat, i.It is in that work that the
history of that branch of the States General should be studied.(52) The question of one or two Chambers in an ordinary monarchy or
commonwealth is altogether different from the same question under a
Federal system.In England or France the question between one or two
Chambers in the Legislature is simply a question in which of the two
ways the Legislature is likely to do its work best.But in a Federal
constitution, like that of Switzerland or the United States, the two
Chambers are absolutely necessary.The double sovereignty, that of
the whole nation and that of the independent and equal States which
have joined together to form it, can be rightly represented only
by having two Chambers, one of them, the _Nationalrath_ or House
of Representatives, directly representing the nation as such, and
the other, the _Ständerath_ or Senate, representing the separate
sovereignty of the Cantons.In the debates early in 1872 as to the
revision of the Swiss Federal Constitution, a proposal made in the
_Nationalrath_ for the abolition of the _Ständerath_ was thrown out by
a large majority.(53) On the old Constitution of Sweden, see Laing’s Tour in Sweden.(54) This common mistake and its cause are fully explained by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.(55) “The two Houses had contended violently in 1675, concerning the
appellate jurisdiction of the Lords; they had contended, with not less
violence, in 1704, upon the jurisdiction of the Commons in matters of
election; they had quarrelled rudely, in 1770, while insisting upon
the exclusion of strangers.But upon general measures of public policy
their differences had been rare and unimportant.” May’s Constitutional
History, i.The writer goes on to show why differences between the
two Houses on important points have become more common in very recent
times.(56) The share of the Witan in early times in the appointment of
Bishops, Ealdormen, and other great officers, need hardly be dwelled
upon.For a debate in a Witenagemót of Eadward the Confessor on a
question of peace or war, see Norman Conquest, ii.For the like
under Henry the Third, see the account in Matthew Paris, in the year
1242 which will be found in Stubbs, 359.The state of the case under
Edward the Third is discussed by Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.But the most remarkable passage of all is one in the
great poetical manifesto which I have several times quoted: it is there
(Political Songs, 96) made one of the charges against Henry the Third
that he wished to keep the appointment of the great officers of state
in his own hands.The passage is long, but it is well worth quoting at
length.“Rex cum suis voluit ita liber esse;
   Et sic esse debuit, fuitque necesse
   Aut esse desineret rex, privatus jure
   Regis, nisi faceret quidquid vellet; curæ
   Non esse magnatibus regni quos præferret
   Suis comitatibus, vel quibus conferret
   Castrorum custodiam, vel quem exhibere
   Populo justitiam vellet, et habere
   Regni cancellarium thesaurariumque.Suum ad arbitrium voluit quemcumque,
   Et consiliarios de quacumque gente,
   Et ministros varios se præcipiente,
   Non intromittentibus se de factis regis
   Angliæ baronibus, vim habente legis
   Principis imperio, et quod imperaret
   Suomet arbitrio singulos ligaret.”

(57) Take for example the Act passed after Edward the Fourth’s success
at Towton.Among other things, poor Henry the Sixth
is not only branded as an usurper, but is charged with personally
stirring up the movement in the North, which led to the battle of
Wakefield and the death of Richard Duke of York.“The seid Henry
Usurpour, late called Kyng Henry the Sixt, contynuyng in his olde
rancour & malice, usyng the fraude & malicious disceit & dissimulacion
ayenst trouth & conscience, that accorde not with the honoure of eny
Cristen Prynce,... with all subtill ymaginacions & disceitfull weyes
& meanes to hym possible, intended & covertely laboured, excited &
procured the fynal destruction, murdre & deth of the seid Richard Duc,
and of his Sonnes, that is to sey, of oure seid nowe Soverayne Lord
Kyng Edward the fourth, then Erle of Marche, & of the noble Lord Edmund
Erle of Ruthlande; & for th’ execution of his dampnable & malicious
purpose, by writing & other messages, mowed, excited, & stured therunto
the Duks of Excestr’ & Somerset, & other lordes beyng then in the North
parties of this Reame.”

(58) This statute was passed in 8 Henry VI.The complaint
which it makes is well worth notice, and shows the reactionary
tendencies of the time.The county elections had been made by “very
great, outrageous, and excessive number of people dwelling within the
same counties, of which most part was people of small substance, and
of no value, whereof every of them pretended a voice equivalent, as to
such elections to be made, with the most worthy knights and esquires
dwelling within the same counties.” To hinder “the manslaughters,
riots, batteries, and divisions,” which were likely to take place—it is
not said that they had taken place—no one is to be allowed to vote who
has not “free land or tenement to the value of forty shillings by the
year at the least above all charges.” It is also provided that both the
electors and the elected are to be actually resident in the county.“Item come lez eleccions dez Chivalers des Countees esluz a venir as
parlements du Roi en plusours Countees Dengleterre, ore tarde ount
este faitz par trop graunde & excessive nombre dez gents demurrantz

chescun ait frank tenement a le valu de xl s. par an al meins outre les
reprises; & que ceux qui seront ensy esluz soient demurrantz & receantz
deins mesmes les Countes.” Revised Statutes, i.The necessity of residence in the case of either electors or
representatives was repealed by 14 Geo.The statute goes on to give the Sheriff power to examine the electors
on oath as to the amount of their property.It also gives the Judges of
Assize a power foreshadowing that of our present Election Judges, that
of inquiring into false returns made by the Sheriff.Another statute of the same kind was passed later in the same reign,
23 Henry VI.1444-5, from which it appears that the knights of
the shire were ceasing to be in all cases knights in the strict sense,
and that it was beginning to be found needful to fence them about with
oligarchic restrictions.“Issint que lez Chivalers dez Counteez pour le parlement en après a
esliers so ent notablez Chivalers dez mesmez lez Counteez pour lez
queux ils serront issint esluz, ou autrement tielx notablez Esquiers
gentils homez del Nativite dez mesmez lez Counteez comme soient ablez
destre Chivalers; et null home destre tiel Chivaler que estoise en la
degree de vadlet et desouth.” Revised Statutes, i.Every enactment of this kind bears witness to the growth of the power
of the Commons, and to the endeavours of the people to make their
representation really popular.(59) Take for instance the account given by the chronicler Hall (p.253) of the election of Edward the Fourth.“After the lordes had considered and weyghed his title and declaracion,
they determined by authoritie of the sayd counsaill, for as much as
kyng Henry, contrary to his othe, honor and agreement, had violated
and infringed, the order taken and enacted in the last Parliament,
and also, because he was insufficient to rule the Realme, & inutile
to the common wealth, & publique profite of the pore people, he was
therefore by the aforesayed authoritie, depriued & deiected of all
kyngly honor, & regall souereigntie.And incontinent, Edward erle of
Marche, sonne and heyre to Richard duke of Yorke, was by the lordes in
the sayd counsaill assembled, named, elected, & admitted, for kyng &
gouernour of the realme; on which day, the people of the erles parte,
beyng in their muster in sainct Ihons felde, & a great number of the
substanciall citezens there assembled, to behold their order: sodaynly
the lord Fawconbridge, which toke the musters, wisely declared to
the multitude, the offences & breaches of the late agremente done &
perpetrated by kyng Henry the vi.& demaunded of the people, whether
they woulde haue the sayd kyng Henry to rule & reigne any lenger ouer
them: To whome they with a whole voyce, aunswered, nay, nay.Then
he asked them, if they would serue, loue, & obey the erle of March
as their earthly prince & souereign lord.To which question they
aunswered, yea, yea, crieng, king Edward, with many great showtes and
clappyng of handes.... The erle,... as kyng, rode to the church of
sainct Paule, and there offered.And after _Te deum_ song, with great
solempnitie, he was conueyed to Westmynster, and there set in the
hawle, with the scepter royall in his hand, where to all the people
which there in a great number were assembled, his title and clayme
to the croune of England, was declared by, ii.maner of ways: the
firste, as sonne and heyre to duke Richard his father, right enheritor
to the same; the second, by aucthoritie of Parliament and forfeiture
committed by, kyng Henry.Wherupon it was agayne demaunded of the
commons, if they would admitte, and take the sayd erle as their prince
and souereigne lord, which al with one voice cried, yea, yea.... On
the morow he was proclaymed kyng by the name of kyng Edward the iiij.throughout the citie.”

This was in Lent 1461, before the battle of Towton.Edward was crowned
June 29th in the same year.The same chronicler describes the election
or acknowledgement of Richard the Third, p.(60) One special sign of the advance of the power of Parliament in the
fifteenth century was the practice of bringing in bills in the form
of Statutes ready made.Hitherto the Acts of the Commons had taken
the form of petitions, and it was sometimes found that, after the
Parliament had broken up, the petitions had been fraudulently modified.They now brought in bills, which the King accepted or rejected as they
stood.“The knight of the shire was the connecting link
between the baron and the shopkeeper.On the same benches on which
sate the goldsmiths, drapers, and grocers who had been returned to
Parliament by the commercial towns, sate also members who, in any other
country, would have been called noblemen, hereditary lords of manors,
entitled to hold courts and to bear coat armour, and able to trace
back an honourable descent through many generations.Some of them were
younger sons and brothers of great lords.Others could boast even of
royal blood.At length the eldest son of an Earl of Bedford, called
in courtesy by the second title of his father, offered himself as a
candidate for a seat in the House of Commons, and his example was
followed by others.Seated in that house, the heirs of the grandees of
the realm naturally became as zealous for its privileges as any of the
humble burgesses with whom they were mingled.”

Hallam remarks (ii.250) that it is in the reign of Edward the Fourth
that we first find borough members bearing the title of Esquire, and
he goes on to refer to the Paston Letters as showing how important
a seat in Parliament was then held, and as showing also the undue
influences which were already brought to bear upon the electors.Since
Hallam’s time, the authenticity of the Paston Letters has been called
in question, but it has, I think, been fully established.Some of the
entries are very curious indeed.96), without any date of
the year, the Duchess of Norfolk writes to John Paston, Esquire, to
use his influence at a county election on behalf of some creatures of
the Duke’s: “It is thought right necessarie for divers causes þͭ my
Lord have at this tyme in the p’lement suche p’sones as longe unto him
and be of his menyall S’vaunts wherin we conceyve yoͬ good will and
diligence shal be right expedient.” The persons to be thus chosen for
the convenience of the Duke are described as “our right wel-belovid
Cossin and S’vaunts John Howard and Syr Roger Chambirlayn.” This is
followed by a letter from the Earl of Oxford in 1455, much to the same
effect.98, we have a letter addressed to the Bailiff of Maldon,
recommending the election of Sir John Paston on behalf of a certain
great lady not named.“Ryght trusty frend I comand me to yow preyĩg yow to call to yoʳ
mynd that lyek as ye and I comonyd of it were necessary for my Lady

(62) On the effects of the reign of Charles the Fifth in Spain and
his overthrow of the liberties of Castile, see the general view in
Robertson, iii.186) he glorifies
the King’s clemency.See also the first chapter of the sixth book
of Prescott’s Philip the Second, and on the suppression of the
constitution of Aragon by Philip, Watson, Philip the Second, iii.The last meeting of the French States-General before the final meeting
in 1789 was that in 1614, during the minority of Lewis the Thirteenth.(63) The legal character of William’s despotism I have tried to set
forth almost throughout the whole of my fourth volume.8, 617; but it is plain to everyone who has the slightest knowledge
of Domesday.Nothing can show more utter ignorance of the real
character of the man and his times than the idea of William being a
mere “rude man of war,” as I have seen him called.(64) On the true aspect of the reign of Henry the Eighth I have said
something in the Fortnightly Review, September 1871.(65) Both these forms of undue influence on the part of the Crown
are set forth by Hallam, Constitutional History, i.“It will not be pretended,” he says, “that the wretched villages,
which corruption and perjury still hardly keep from famine [this was
written before the Reform Bill, in 1827], were seats of commerce and
industry in the sixteenth century.But the county of Cornwall was more
immediately subject to a coercive influence, through the indefinite and
oppressive jurisdiction of the stannary court.Similar motives, if we
could discover the secrets of those governments, doubtless operated in
most other cases.”

In the same page the historian, speaking of the different boroughs and
counties which received the franchise in the sixteenth century, says,
“It might be possible to trace the reason, why the county of Durham was
passed over.” And he suggests, “The attachment of those northern parts
to popery seems as likely as any other.” The reason for the omission
of Durham was doubtless that the Bishoprick had not wholly lost the
character of a separate principality.It was under Charles the Second
that Durham city and county, as well as Newark, first sent members to
Parliament.Durham was enfranchised by Act of Parliament, as Chester
city and county—hitherto kept distinct as being a Palatinate—were by
34 & 35 Hen.Newark was
enfranchised by a Royal Charter, the last case of that kind of exercise
of the prerogative.(66) I do not know what was the exact state of Old Sarum in 1265 or
in 1295, but earlier in the thirteenth century it was still the chief
dwelling-place both of the Earl and of the Bishop.But in the reign
of Edward the Third it had so greatly decayed that the stones of the
Cathedral were used for the completion of the new one which had arisen
in the plain.(67) On the relations between Queen Elizabeth and her Parliaments,
and especially for the bold bearing of the two Wentworths, Peter and
Paul, see the fifth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional History, largely
grounded on the Journals of Sir Simonds D’Ewes.The frontispiece to
D’Ewes’ book (London, 1682) gives a lively picture of a Parliament of
those days.(68) On the relations between the Crown and the House of Commons under
James the First, see the sixth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional
History, and the fifth chapter of Gardner’s History of England from
1603 to 1616.(1) This was the famous motion made by Sir Robert Peel against the
Ministry of Lord Melbourne, and carried by a majority of one, June 4,
1841.See May’s Constitutional History, i.Irving’s Annals of our
Times, 86.(2) This of course leaves to the Ministry the power of appealing to the
country by a dissolution of Parliament; but, if the new Parliament also
declares against them, it is plain that they have nothing to do but to
resign office.In the case of 1841 Lord Melbourne dissolved Parliament,
and, on the meeting of the new Parliament, an amendment to the address
was carried by a majority of ninety-one, August 28, 1841.(3) This is well set forth by Sir John Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum
Angliæ, cap.36: “Neque Rex ibidem, per se aut ministros suos,
tallegia, subsidia, aut quævis onera alia, imponit legiis suis, aut
leges eorum mutat, vel novas condit, sine concessione vel assensu
totius regni sui in parliamento suo expresso.”

(4) How very recent the establishment of these principles is will be
seen by anyone who studies the history of the reign of George the Third
in the work of Sir T. E. May.Pitt, as is well known, kept office
in defiance of repeated votes of the House of Commons, and at last, by
a dissolution at a well-chosen moment, showed that the country was on
his side.Such conduct would not be deemed constitutional now, but the
wide difference between the constitution of the House of Commons then
and now should be borne in mind.(5) Though the command of the Sovereign would be no excuse for any
illegal act, and though the advisers of any illegal act are themselves
responsible for it, yet there would seem to be no way provided for
punishing an illegal act done by the Sovereign in his own person.The
Sovereign may therefore be said to be personally irresponsible.(6) See Macaulay, iv.It should not be forgotten that writers like
Blackstone and De Lolme say nothing about the Cabinet.Serjeant Stephen
supplies the omission, ii.(7) The lowly outward position of the really ruling assembly comes out
in some degree at the opening of every session of Parliament.But it is
far more marked in the grotesque, and probably antiquated, ceremonies
of a Conference of the two Houses.This comes out most curiously of all
in the Conference between the two Houses of the Convention in 1688.(8) See Note 56, Chapter ii.(9) See Macaulay, iv.(10) “Ministers” or “Ministry” were the words always used at the
time of the Reform Bill in 1831-1832.It would be curious to trace
at what time the present mode of speech came into vogue, either in
parliamentary debates or in common speech.Another still later change marks a step toward the recognition of the
Cabinet.It has long been held that a Secretary of State must always
accompany the Sovereign everywhere.It is now beginning to be held that
any member of the Cabinet will do as well as a Secretary of State.But
if any member of the Cabinet, why not any Privy Councillor?Cayley moved for a “Select Committee to
consider the duties of the Member leading the Government business in
this House, and the expediency of attaching office and salary thereto.”
The motion was withdrawn, after being opposed by Sir Charles Wood
(now Viscount Halifax), Mr.Walpole, and Lord John Russell (now Earl
Russell).Sir Charles Wood described the post of Leader of the House
as “an office that does not exist, and the duties of which cannot be
defined.” Mr.Walpole spoke of it as a “position totally unknown to the
constitution of the country.” Yet I presume that everybody practically
knew that Lord John Russell was Leader of the House, though nobody
could give a legal definition of his position.Walpole and Lord John Russell on the nature of
ministerial responsibility.Walpole said that “members were apt to
talk gravely of ministerial responsibility; but responsibility there is
none, except by virtue of the office that a Minister holds, or possibly
by the fact of his being a Privy Councillor.A Minister is responsible
for the acts done by him; a Privy Councillor for advice given by him in
that capacity.Until the reign of Charles the Second, Privy Councillors
always signed the advice they gave; and to this day the Cabinet is not
a body recognised by law.As a Privy Councillor, a person is under
little or no responsibility for the acts advised by him, on account of
the difficulty of proof.” Lord John Russell “asked the House to pause
before it gave assent to the constitutional doctrines laid down by Mr.He unduly restricted the responsibility of Ministers.”... “I
hold,” continued Lord John, “that it is not really for the business the
Minister transacts in performing the particular duties of his office,
but it is for any advice which he has given, and which he may be
proved, before a Committee of this House, or at the bar of the House of
Lords, to have given, that he is responsible, and for which he suffers
the penalties that may ensue from impeachment.”

It is plain that both Mr.Walpole and Lord Russell were here speaking
of real legal responsibility, such responsibility as might be enforced
by impeachment or other legal process, not of the vaguer kind of
responsibility which is commonly meant when we speak of Ministers being
“responsible to the House of Commons.” This last is enforced, not by
legal process, but by such motions as that of Sir Robert Peel in 1841,
or that of the Marquess of Hartington in June 1859.I have made my extracts from the Spectator newspaper of February 11,
1854.(12) We read (Anglia Sacra, i.335) of Æthelric, Bishop of the
South-Saxons at the time of the Conquest, as “vir antiquissimus et
legum terræ sapientissimus.” So Adelelm, the first Norman Abbot of
Abingdon, found much benefit from the legal knowledge of certain of his
English monks (Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon, ii.2), “quibus tanta
secularium facundia et præteritorum memoria eventorum inerat, ut cæteri
circumquaque facile eorum sententiam ratam fuisse, quam edicerent,
approbarent.” The writer adds, “Sed et alii plures de Anglis causidici
per id tempus in abbatia ista habebantur quorum collationi nemo sapiens
refragabatur.” But knowledge of the law was not an exclusively clerical
accomplishment; for among the grounds for the election of King Harold
himself, we find (de Inventione Sanctæ Crucis Walthamensis, p.25,
Stubbs) that one was “quia non erat eo prudentior in terra, armis
strenuus magis, legum terræ sagacior.” See Norman Conquest, ii.(13) On the growth of the lawyers’ theory of the royal prerogative, and
its utter lack of historical standing-ground, I must refer once for all
to Allen’s Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in
England.(15) The history of this memorable revolution will be found in
Lingard, iii.392-405, and the legal points are brought out by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.He remarks that “In this revolution of 1399
there was as remarkable an attention shown to the formalities of the
constitution, allowance made for the men and the times, as in that
of 1688;” and, speaking of the device by which the same Parliament
was brought together again, he adds, “In this contrivance, more than
in all the rest, we may trace the hand of lawyers.” The official
version entered on the rolls of Parliament by command of Henry will
be found in Walsingham, ii.Some care seems to be used to
avoid using the name of Parliament in the account of the actual
proceedings.It is said just before, “Rex perductus est Londonias,
conservandus in Turri usque ad Parliamentum proximo celebrandum.”
And the writs are said to have been sent “ad personas regni qui de
jure debeant interesse Parliamento.” But when they have come together
(“quibus convenientibus”) care seems to be taken to give the Assembly
no particular name, till, in the Act of Richard’s deposition, the
actors are described as “pares et proceres regni Angliæ spirituales
et temporales, et ejus regni communitates, omnes status ejusdem regni
repræsentantes;” and in the Act of Henry’s election they are described
as “domini tam spirituales quam temporales, et omnes regni status.” In
the Act of deposition Richard’s resignation of the Crown is recorded,
as well as his particular crimes and his general unfitness to wear it,
all which are classed together as reasons for his deposition.The
actual formula of deposition runs thus:—“propter præmissa, et eorum
prætextu, ab omni dignitate et honore regiis, _si quid dignitatis et
honoris hujusmodi in eo remanserit_, merito deponendum pronunciamus,
decernimus, et declaramus; et etiam simili cautela deponimus.” They
then declare the throne to be vacant (“ut constabat de præmissis,
et eorum occasione, regnum Angliæ, cum pertinentiis suis, vacare”).Henry then makes his challenge, setting forth that strange mixture of
titles which is commented on in most narratives of the event, and the
Estates, without saying which of Henry’s arguments they accept, grant
the kingdom to him (“concesserunt unanimiter ut Dux præfatus super eos
regnaret”).A more distinct case of deposition and election can hardly
be found; only in the words which I have put in italics there seems a
sort of anxiety to complete, by the act of deposition, any possible
defect in Richard’s doubtless unwilling abdication.The French narrative by a partisan of Richard (Lystoire de la Traison
et Mort du Roy Richart Dengleterre, p.68) gives, in some respects, a
different account.The Assembly is called a Parliament, and the Duke
of Lancaster is made to seat himself on the throne at once.Then Sir
Thomas Percy “cria ‘Veez Henry de Lencastre Roy Dengleterre.’ Adonc
crierent tous les seigneurs prelaz et _le commun de Londres_, Ouy Ouy
nous voulons que Henry duc de Lencastre soit nostre Roy et nul autre.”
For “le commun de Londres” there are other readings, “le commun,” “le
commun Dangleterre et de Londres,” and “tout le commun et conseil de
Londres.”

(16) It should be remembered that Charles the First was not deposed,
but was executed being King.He was called King both in the indictment
at his trial and in the warrant of his beheading.(17) Monk raised this point in 1660.612) remarks that at this particular moment “there
was no court to influence, no interference of the military to control
the elections.” The Convention may therefore be supposed to have been
more freely elected than most Parliaments.(19) The Long Parliament had dissolved itself, and had decreed the
election of its successor.733) the Long Parliament is “declared and adjudged to be fully
dissolved and determined;” but it is not said when it was dissolved and
determined.5; Hallam’s Constitutional History,
ii.21, where the whole matter is discussed, and it is remarked that
“the next Parliament never gave their predecessors any other name in
the Journals than ‘the late assembly.’”

(20) See Norman Conquest, i.(21) See the discussion on the famous vote of the Convention Parliament
in Hallam, Constitutional History, ii.Hallam remarks that “the word ‘forfeiture’ might better have answered
this purpose than ‘abdication’ or ‘desertion,’” and he adds, “they
proceeded not by the stated rules of the English government, but by
the general rights of mankind.They looked not so much to Magna Charta
as the original compact of society, and rejected Coke and Hale for
Hooker and Harrington.” My position is that there is no need to go to
what Hallam calls “higher constitutional laws” for the justification
of the doings of the Convention, but that they were fully justified
by the precedents of English History from the eighth century to the
fourteenth.The Scottish Estates, it should be remembered, did not shrink from
using the word “forfeited.” Macaulay, iii.(22) See the Act 1 William and Mary “for removing and preventing all
Questions and Disputes concerning the Assembling and Sitting of this
Present Parliament” (Revised Statutes, ii.It decrees “That the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons convened at Westminster the
two and twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
six hundred eighty-eight, and there sitting on the thirteenth day of
February following, are the two Houses of Parliament, and so shall be
and are hereby declared enacted and adjudged to be to all intents,
constructions, and purposes whatsoever, notwithstanding any fault of
writ or writs of summons, or any defect of form or default whatsoever,
as if they had been summoned according to the usual form.” The whole
history of the question is given in Macaulay, iii.The whole
matter is summed up in the words (iii.27), “It was answered that the
royal writ was mere matter of form, and that to expose the substance
of our laws and liberties to serious hazard for the sake of a form
would be the most senseless superstition.Wherever the Sovereign, the
Peers spiritual and temporal, and the Representatives freely chosen by
the constituent bodies of the realm were met together, there was the
essence of a Parliament.” In earlier times it might perhaps have been
held that there might be the essence of a Parliament even without the
Sovereign.“A paper had been circulated, in which the
logic of a small sharp pettifogger was employed to prove that writs,
issued in the joint names of William and Mary, ceased to be of force
as soon as William reigned alone.But this paltry cavil had completely
failed.It had not even been mentioned in the Lower House, and had been
mentioned in the Upper only to be contemptuously overruled.” From my
point of view the cavil is certainly paltry, but it is hard to see that
it is more paltry than the others.(24) This is by the Acts 7 and 8 Will.See Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.Blackstone’s
reasoning runs thus: “This dissolution formerly happened immediately
upon the death of the reigning sovereign; for he being considered in
law as the head of the parliament (caput principium, et finis), that
failing, the whole body was held to be extinct.But the calling a new
parliament immediately on the inauguration of the successor being found
inconvenient, and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament
in being, in case of a disputed succession, it was enacted,” etc.By
the Reform Act of 1867 the whole tradition of the lawyers was swept
away.(25) I have said something on this head in Norman Conquest, i.94,
but the whole thing should be studied in Allen’s great section on the
Tenure of Landed Property; Royal Prerogative, 125-155.It is to Allen
that the honour belongs of showing what _bookland_ and _folkland_
really were.(26) I have given a few examples in Norman Conquest, i.Endless
examples will be found in Kemble’s Codex Diplomaticus.(27) See the complaints on this head as late as the time of William
the Third, in Macaulay, iv.On the Acts by which the power of the
Crown in this matter is restrained, see Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.See also May’s Constitutional History, i.(29) This is discussed in full by Allen, Royal Prerogative, 143-145.The great example is the will of King Ælfred.249; Allen, 154-155, who remarks: “By a singular
revolution of policy there was a recurrence in the late reign to the
ancient policy of the Anglo-Saxons.The crown lands were virtually
restored to the public, while the King obtained the right of acquiring
landed property by purchase, and of bequeathing it by will like a
private person.”

(31) Edward the First was the earliest King whose reign is dated from
a time earlier than his coronation.He was out of the kingdom at his
father’s death, and his right was acknowledged without opposition.But
even in this case there was an interregnum.The regnal years of Edward
the First are not reckoned from the day of his father’s death, but
from the day of his funeral, when Edward was acknowledged King, and
when the prelates and nobles swore allegiance to him.See the account
in the Worcester Annals, Annales Monastici, iv.462, and the documents
in Rymer, i. part ii.See also the remarks of Allen, 46, 47.The
doctrine that there can be no interregnum seems to have been put into
shape to please James the First, and it was of course altogether upset
by the great vote of 1688.Now of course there is no interregnum; not
indeed from any mysterious prerogative of the Crown, but simply because
the Act of Settlement has entailed the Crown in a particular way.(32) On this see Norman Conquest, i.See the same
question discussed in quite another part of the world in Herodotus,
vii.(33) The helpless way in which Blackstone himself wrote was perhaps
pardonable in the dark times in which he lived.But it is really too
bad when lawyer after lawyer, in successive editions, gives again to
the world the astounding rubbish which in Blackstone’s day passed
for early constitutional history.In Kerr’s edition of Blackstone,
published in 1857, vol.180, I find repeated, without alteration
or comment, the monstrous assertion of Blackstone: “I believe there
is no instance wherein the Crown of England has ever been asserted to
be elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled
trial of King Charles I.” And in Serjeant Stephen’s Commentaries
(1853), which are not a mere edition of Blackstone, but “New
Commentaries partly founded on Blackstone,” the same words are found
in vol.403, only leaving out the epithet “unparalleled,” which
might with truth have been allowed to stay.481-2) we read how “after the Saxon government was firmly established
in this island” came “the subdivision of the kingdom into a heptarchy,
consisting of seven independent kingdoms, peopled and governed by
different clans and colonies.” It seems then that in 1857 there
were learned gentlemen who believed in a kingdom subdivided into a
heptarchy.But when, in the next page, Blackstone tells us how Ælfred
set about “to new-model the constitution, to rebuild it on a plan that
should endure for ages,” and goes on in the usual style to attribute
everything whatever to Ælfred personally, this seems to have been too
much, and the editor gives an extract from Kemble by way of correction.One wonders that, if he had read Kemble at all, he had not learned a
little more from him.It is amusing again when Blackstone tells us (i.186, Kerr), “From Egbert to the death of Edmund Ironside, a period
of above two hundred years, the Crown descended regularly through a
succession of fifteen princes, without any deviation or interruption:
save only”—all the cases where it did not descend regularly, according
to Blackstone’s notions of regularity: But it is almost more amusing
when Serjeant Stephen (ii.410) throws Blackstone’s exceptions, which
are at least historical facts, into a note, and gives us instead as
his own exceptions, the statement, very doubtful and, if true, utterly
irrelevant, that Æthelstan and Eadmund Ironside were illegitimate (see
Norman Conquest, i.We of course get the usual talk about the
usurpations of Harold, Stephen, John, and Henry the Fourth, and about
the rights of Eadgar and Arthur of Britanny.For the former we get a
quotation from Matthew Paris, to whom it would have been more to the
purpose to go for the great speech of Archbishop Hubert.The comments
on the succession of John (i.189, Kerr) are singularly amusing, but
too long to quote.To prove the strictly hereditary
nature of the succession, Blackstone (i.189, Kerr) quotes the Statute
of 25 Edward III.“that the law of the Crown of England is, and always
hath been, that the children of the King of England, whether born in
England or elsewhere, ought to bear the inheritance after the death of
their ancestors.” We are bound to suppose that these learned lawyers
had read through the statute which they quoted; but it is wonderful
that they did not see that it had nothing whatever to do with fixing
the hereditary succession of the Crown.The original text (Revised
Statutes, i.176) runs thus:—

“La lei de la Corone Dengleterre est, et ad este touz jours tiele,
que les enfantz des Rois Dengleterre, _queu part qils soient neez en
Engleterre ou aillors_, sont ables et deivent porter heritage, apres la
mort lour auncestors.”

The object of the statute is something quite different from what any
one would think from Blackstone’s way of quoting it.The emphatic words
are those which are put in italics.The object of the statute is to
make the King’s children and others born of English parents beyond sea
capable of inheriting in England.As far as the succession to the Crown
is concerned, its effect is simply to put a child of the King born out
of the realm on a level with his brother born in the realm; that is,
in the view of our older Law, to give both alike the preference due to
an Ætheling.(34) It is as well to explain this, because most people seem to think
that a man becomes a Bishop by virtue of receiving a private letter
from the First Lord of the Treasury.We constantly see a man spoken of
as Bishop of such a see, and his works advertised as such, before a
single ecclesiastical or legal step has been taken to make him so.(36) The succession of a grandson, which first took place in England in
the case of Richard the Second, marks a distinct stage in the growth
of the doctrine of hereditary right.It involves the doctrine of
representation, which is a very subtle and technical one, and is not
nearly so obvious or so likely to occur in an early state of society
as the doctrine of nearness of kin.No opposition was made to the
accession of Richard the Second, but there seems to have been a strong
notion in men’s minds that John of Gaunt sought to displace his nephew.In earlier times, as the eldest and most eminent of the surviving sons
of Edward the Third, John would probably have been elected without any
thought of the claims of young Richard.(37) In Yorkist official language the three Lancastrian Kings were
usurpers, and Duke Richard was _de jure_, though not _de facto_, King.Henry the Sixth is, in the Act of 1461, “Henry Usurpour, late called
Kyng Henry the sixt.” The claim of the House of York was through an
intricate female descent from Lionel Duke of Clarence, a son of Edward
the Third older than John of Gaunt.A claim so purely technical had
never been set forth before; but we may be quite sure that it would not
have been thought to have much weight, if Duke Richard had not been, by
another branch, descended from Edward the Third in the male line, and
if he had not moreover been the ablest and most popular nobleman in the
country.(38) A prospective election before the vacancy of course hindered
any interregnum.In this case the formula “Le Roi est mort; vive le
Roi,” was perfectly true.The new King was already chosen and crowned,
and he had nothing to do but to go on reigning singly instead of in
partnership with his father, just as William went on reigning alone
after the death of Mary.In Germany this took place whenever a King
of the Romans was chosen in the lifetime of the reigning Emperor.In
France, under the early Kings of the Parisian dynasty, the practice
was specially common, and the fact that there seldom or never was an
interregnum doubtless helped much to make the French Crown become, as
it did, the most strictly hereditary crown in Christendom.In England,
the only distinct case of a coronation of a son during the lifetime of
his father was that of Henry, the son of Henry the Second, known as the
younger King, and sometimes as Henry the Third.In earlier times we get
something like it in the settlement of the Crown by Æthelwulf, with the
consent of his Witan (see Old-English History, 105, 106), but it does
not seem clear whether there was in this case any actual coronation
during the father’s lifetime.If there was not, this would be the case
most like that of Duke Richard.The compromise placed the Duke in the
same position as if he had been Prince of Wales, or rather in a better
position, for it might be held to shut out the need of even a formal
election on the King’s death.(39) See note 59 on Chapter II.(41) See Hallam’s Constitutional History, i.It is to be noticed
that the settlement enacts that “the inheritance of the Crown, &c.,
should remain in Henry the Seventh and the heirs of his body for ever,
and in none other.” This would seem to bar a great number of contingent
claims in various descendants of earlier Kings.As it happens, this Act
has been literally carried out, for every later Sovereign of England
has been a descendant of the body of Henry the Seventh.(42) The will of Henry the Eighth is fully discussed by Hallam, i.34,
288, 294; Lingard, vi.There are two Acts of Henry’s reign bearing
on the matter.7, the Crown is
entailed on the King’s sons by Jane Seymour or any other wife; then
on the King’s legitimate daughters, no names being mentioned; the Act
then goes on to say, “your Highnes shall have full and plenar power
and auctorite to geve despose appoynte assigne declare and lymytt by
your letters patentes under your great seale or ells by your laste Will
made in wrytynge and signed with your moste gracious hande, at your
onely pleasure from tyme to tyme herafter, the imperiall Crowne of this
Realme and all other the premisses thereunto belongyng, to be remayne
succede and come after your decease and for lack of lawfull heires of
your body to be procreated and begoten as is afore lymytted by this
Acte, to such person or persones in possession and remaynder as shall
please your Highnes and according to such estate and after such maner
forme facion ordre and condicion as shalbe expressed declared named and
lymytted in your said letters patentes or by your said laste will.”
The later Act, 35 Henry VIII.1, puts Henry’s two daughters, Mary
and Elizabeth, into the entail, but in a very remarkable way.The Acts
declaring their illegitimacy are not repealed, nor is the legitimacy of
either of them in any way asserted; in fact it is rather denied when
the preamble rehearses that “The king’s Majesty hath only issue of his
body lawfully begotten betwixt his Highness and his said late wife
Queen Jane the noble and excellent Prince Edward.” The Act then goes
on to enact that, although the King had been enabled to “dispose” the
Crown “to any person or persons of such estate therein as should please
his Highness to limit and appoint,” yet that, in failure of heirs of
the body of either the King or his son, “the said imperial Crown and
all other the premises shall be to the Lady Mary the King’s Highness
daughter, and to the heirs of the body of the same Lady Mary lawfully
begotten, with such conditions as by his Highness shall be limited by
his letters patents under his great seal, or by his Majesty’s last will
in writing signed with his gracious hand.” Failing Mary and her issue,
the same conditional entail is extended to Elizabeth and her issue.The
power of creating a remainder after the issue of Elizabeth of course
remained with Henry, and he exercised it in favour of the issue of his
younger sister Mary.Mary and Elizabeth therefore really reigned, not
by virtue of any royal descent, but by virtue of a particular entail by
which the Crown was settled on the King’s illegitimate daughters, as it
might have been settled on a perfect stranger.It was an attempt on the
part of Edward the Sixth to do without parliamentary authority what his
father had done by parliamentary authority which led to the momentary
occupation of the throne by Lady Jane Grey.Mary, on her accession,
raked up the whole story of her mother’s marriage and divorce, and the
Act of the first year of her reign recognized her as inheriting by
legitimate succession.The Act passed on the accession of Elizabeth,
1 Eliz.It enacts “that your majestie our sayd
Sovereigne Ladye ys and in verye dede and of most meere right ought
to bee by the Lawes of God and the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme
our most rightfull and lawfull Sovereigne liege Ladie and Quene; and
that your Highness ys rightlye lynyallye and lawfully discended and
come of the bloodd royall of this Realme of Englande in and to whose
princely person and theires of your bodye lawfully to bee begotten
after youe without all doubte ambiguitee scruple or question the
imperiall and Royall estate place crowne and dignitie of this Reallme
withe all honnours stiles titles dignities Regalities Jurisdiccons and
preheminences to the same nowe belonging & apperteyning arre & shalbee
most fully rightfully really & entierly invested & incorporated united
& annexed as rightfully & lawfully to all intentes construccons &
purposes as the same were in the said late Henrye theight or in the
late King Edwarde the Syxte your Highnes Brother, or in the late Quen
Marye your Highnes syster at anye tyme since thacte of parliament made
in the xxxvth yere of the reigne of your said most noble father king
Henrye theight.”

It should be remembered that Sir Thomas More, though he refused to
swear to the preamble of the oath prescribed by the Act of Supremacy,
was ready to swear to the order of succession which entailed the Crown
on the issue of Anne Boleyn.On his principles the issue of Anne Boleyn
would be illegitimate; but he also held that Parliament could settle
the Crown upon anybody, on an illegitimate child of the King or on an
utter stranger; to the succession therefore he had no objection to
swear.For a parallel to the extraordinary power thus granted to Henry we have
to go back to the days of Æthelwulf.(43) The position of the daughters of Henry the Eighth was of course
practically affected by the fact that each was the child of a mother
who was acknowledged as a lawful wife at the time of her daughter’s
birth.There was manifest harshness in ranking children so born with
ordinary illegitimate children; but, in strictness of Law, as Henry
married Anne Boleyn while Katharine of Aragon was alive, the daughter
of Katharine and the daughter of Anne could not both be legitimate.It should also be
remembered that the marriage of Anne Boleyn was declared void, and her
daughter declared illegitimate, on grounds—whatever they were—which had
nothing to do with the earlier question of the marriage and divorce of
Katharine.1, declares it to be treason “yf any person shall in any wyse holde
and affyrme or mayntayne that the Common Lawes of this Realme not
altred by Parlyament, ought not to dyrecte the Ryght of the crowne
of England, or that our said sovrayne Ladye Elizabeth the Quenes
Majestie that nowe is, with and by the aucthoritye of the Parlyament
of Englande is not able to make Lawes and Statutes of suffycyent force
and valyditie to lymit and bynd the Crowne of this Realme, and the
Descent Lymitacion Inheritaunce and Government thereof.” The like is
the crime of “whosoever shall hereafter duryng the Lyef of our said
Soveraigne Ladye, by any Booke or Worke prynted or written, dyrectly
and expresly declare and affyrme at any tyme before the same be by Acte
of Parlyament of this Realme established and affyrmed, that any one
particular person whosover it be, is or ought to be the ryght Heire
and Successor to the Queenes Majestie that nowe is (whome God longe
preserve) except the same be the naturall yssue of her Majesties bodye.”

This statute may possibly be taken as setting aside the claims of the
House of Suffolk; but, if so, it sets aside the claims of the House of
Stewart along with them.(45) James’s right was acknowledged by his own first Parliament, just
as the claims of other Kings who entered in an irregular way had
been.It should be marked however that he was crowned before he was
acknowledged.1, declares that “immediatelie upon
the Dissolution and Decease of Elizabeth late Queene of England, the
Imperiall Crowne of the Realme of England, and of all the Kingdomes
Dominions and Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birthright
and lawfull undoubted Succession, descend and come to your moste
excellent Majestie, as beinge lineallie justly and lawfullie next and
sole Heire of the Blood Royall of this Realme as is aforesaid.” It is
worth noticing that in this Act we get the following definition of
Parliament; “this high Court of Parliament, where all the whole Body of
the Realm and every particular member thereof, either in Person or by
Representation (upon their own free elections), are by the Laws of this
Realm deemed to be personally present.”

(46) The fact that James the First, a King who came in with no title
whatever but what was given him by an Act of Parliament passed after
his coronation, was acknowledged without the faintest opposition is
one of the most remarkable things in our history.294)
remarks that “there is much reason to believe that the consciousness of
this defect in his parliamentary title put James on magnifying, still
more than from his natural temper he was prone to do, the inherent
rights of primogenitory succession, as something indefeasible by the
legislature; a doctrine which, however it might suit the schools of
divinity, was in diametrical opposition to our statutes.” Certainly no
opposition can be more strongly marked than that between the language
of James’s own Parliament and the words quoted above from 13 Eliz.But see the remarks of Hallam a few pages before (i.288) on the
kind of tacit election by which it might be said that James reigned.“What renders it absurd to call him and his children usurpers?He had
that which the flatterers of his family most affected to disdain—the
will of the people; not certainly expressed in regular suffrage or
declared election, but unanimously and voluntarily ratifying that which
in itself could surely give no right, the determination of the late
Queen’s Council to proclaim his accession to the throne.”

(47) Whitelocke’s Memorials, 367.“The heads of the charge against the
King were published by leave, in this form: That Charles Stuart, being
admitted King of England, & therein trusted with a limited power, to
govern by, & according to the Laws of the Land, & not otherwise, &
by his trust being obliged, as also by his Oath, & office to use the
power committed to him, for the good & benefit of the people, & for the
preservation of their Rights and Privileges,” etc.At an earlier stage (365) the President had told the King that the
Court “sat here by the Authority of the Commons of England: & all your
predecessours, & you are responsible to them.” The King answered “I
deny that, shew me one Precedent.” The President, instead of quoting
the precedents which were at least plausible, told the prisoner that
he was not to interrupt the Court.Earlier still the King had objected
to the authority of the Court that “he saw no Lords there which should
make a Parliament, including the King, & urged that the Kingdom
of England was hereditary, & not successive.” The strong point of
Charles’s argument undoubtedly was the want of concurrence on the part
of the Lords.Both Houses of Parliament had agreed in the proceedings
against Edward the Second and Richard the Second.It is a small point, but it is well to notice that the description of
the King as Charles Stewart was perfectly accurate.Charles, the son
of James, the son of Henry Stewart Lord Darnley, really had a surname,
though it might not be according to Court etiquette to call him by
it.The helpless French imitators in 1793 summoned their King by the
name of “Louis Capet,” as if Charles had been summoned by the name of
“Unready,” “Bastard,” “Lackland,” “Longshanks,” or any other nickname
of an earlier King and forefather.I believe that many people fancy that Guelph or Welf is a surname of
the present, or rather late, royal family.(48) The Act 1 William and Mary (Revised Statutes, ii.11) entailed the
Crown “after their deceases,” “to the heires of the body of the said
princesse & for default of such issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke
& the heires of her body & for default of such issue to the heires of
the body of the said Prince of Orange.” It was only after the death of
“the most hopeful Prince William Duke of Gloucester” that the Crown
was settled (12 and 13 Will.94) on
“the most excellent Princess Sophia Electress and Dutchess Dowager of
Hannover, daughter of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen
of Bohemia, daughter of our late sovereign lord King James the First of
happy memory,” “and the heirs of her body being protestants.”

(49) We hardly need assurance of the fact, but if it were needed,
something like an assurance to that effect was given by an official
member of the House during the session of 1872.At all events we
read in Sir T. E. May (ii.83); “The increased power of the House
of Commons, under an improved representation, has been patent and
indisputable.Responsible to the people, it has, at the same time,
wielded the people’s strength.No longer subservient to the crown, the
ministers, and the peerage, it has become the predominant authority
in the state.” But the following strange remark follows: “But it is
characteristic of the British constitution, and _a proof of its
freedom from the spirit of democracy_, that the more dominant the power
of the House of Commons,—the greater has been its respect for the law,
and the more carefully have its acts been restrained within the proper
limits of its own jurisdiction.”

  ὦ δημοκρατία, ταῦτα δῆτ' ἀνασχετά;

Has Mr.Grote lived and written so utterly in vain that a writer widely
indeed removed from the vulgar herd of oligarchic babblers looks on
“the spirit of democracy” as something inconsistent with “respect for
the law”?(50) The story is told (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 7), that King Theopompos,
having submitted to the lessening of the kingly power by that of the
Ephors, was rebuked by his wife, because the power which he handed on
to those who came after him would be less than what he had received
from those who went before him.ὃν καί φασιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γυναικὸς
ὀνειδιζόμενον ὡς ἐλάττω παραδώσοντα τοῖς παισὶ τὴν βασιλείαν, ἢ

ἄγαν ἀποβαλοῦσα μετὰ τοῦ φθόνου διέφυγε τὸν κίνδυνον.11) tells the story to the same effect, bringing it in with
the comment, ὅσῳ γὰρ ἂν ἐλαττόνων ὦσι κύριοι, πλείω χρόνον ἀναγκαῖον
μένειν πᾶσαν τὴν ἀρχήν· αὐτοί τε γὰρ ἧττον γίνονται δεσποτικοὶ καὶ

τὴν βασιλείαν, ὥστε τρόπον τινὰ ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἐλάττονα ἀλλὰ μείζονα
αὐτήν.The kingdom of the Molossians, referred to in the extract from
Aristotle, is one of those states of antiquity of which we should
be well pleased to hear more.Like the Macedonian kingdom, it was an
instance of the heroic kingship surviving into the historical ages of
Greece.But the Molossian kingship seems to have been more regular and
popular than that of Macedonia, and to have better deserved the name
of a constitutional monarchy.The Molossian people and the Molossian
King exchanged oaths not unlike those of the Landesgemeinde and the
Landammann of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden, the King swearing to rule
according to the laws, and the people swearing to maintain the kingdom
according to the laws.In the end the kingdom changed into a Federal
Republic.(51) It is simply frivolous in the present state of England to discuss
the comparative merits of commonwealths and constitutional monarchies
with any practical object.Constitutional monarchy is not only firmly
fixed in the hearts of the people, but it has some distinct advantages
over republican forms of government, just as republican forms of
government have some advantages over it.It may be doubted whether
the people have not a more real control over the Executive, when the
House of Commons, or, in the last resort, the people itself in the
polling-booths (as in 1868), can displace a Government at any moment,
than they have in constitutions in which an Executive, however much
it may have disappointed the hopes of those who chose it, cannot be
removed before the end of its term of office, except on the legal
proof of some definite crime.But in itself, there really seems no
reason why the form of the Executive Government should not be held
to be as lawful a subject for discussion as the House of Lords, the
Established Church, the standing army, or anything else.It shows
simple ignorance, if it does not show something worse, when the word
“republican” is used as synonymous with cut-throat or pickpocket.I do
not find that in republican countries this kind of language is applied
to the admirers of monarchy; but the people who talk in this way are
just those who have no knowledge of republics either in past history or
in present times.They may very likely have climbed a Swiss mountain,
but they have taken care not to ask what was the constitution of the
country at its foot.They may even have learned to write Greek iambics
and to discuss Greek particles; but they have learned nothing from
the treasures of wisdom taught by Grecian history from Herodotus to
Polybios.I have discussed the three chief forms of executive government, the
constitutional King and his Ministry, the President, and the Executive
Council, in the last of my first series of Historical Essays.250:—

MACMILLAN AND CO., LONDON.The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was
struck with the change in M. Rodin's voice.He answered him, therefore,
with much sympathy: "Pardon my indiscretion, sir; I really did not
know--"

"It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of
feeling--tears are so rare with old men--but if you had seen, as I have,
the despair of that excellent princess, whose only fault has been too
much kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece--by which she
has encouraged her--but, once more, let us talk of something else, my
dear sir!"After a moment's pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from his
emotion, he said to Dupont: "One part of my mission, my dear sir--that
which relates to the Green Chamber--I have now told you; but there is yet
another.Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a
circumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or
sixteen years ago, the Marquis d'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in
garrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house."It was only just now, that I
was talking about him to my wife.He was the life of the house!--how well
he could perform plays--particularly the character of a scapegrace.In
the Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with laughing, in
that part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he
sang Joconde, sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!"Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: "You
doubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious
Bonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d'Aigrigny (whose private
secretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church.""That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and
flattered--abandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and,
notwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation as a
great preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain
abbe--whilst so many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are
archbishops and cardinals."M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of
conviction, and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that
M. Dupont could not help exclaiming: "Well, sir, that is splendid
conduct!"said M. Rodin, with an inimitable expression of
simplicity; "it is quite a matter of course when one has a heart like M.
d'Aigrigny's.But amongst all his good qualities, he has particularly
that of never forgetting worthy people--people of integrity, honor,
conscience--and therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he has not forgotten you.""What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember--"

"Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions your
name.""He will be there soon, if not there now.He went to Italy about three
months ago, and, during his absence, he received a very sad piece of
news--the death of his mother, who was passing the autumn on one of the
estates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier.""Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves to
the will of Providence!""And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to
mention my name?"First of all, you must know that this house is
sold.The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from
Paris.""I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as their
bailiff."It is just on that subject that I am going
to speak to you."Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you, I am
particularly desirous that you should keep this place, and I will do all
in my power to serve you, if--"

"Ah, sir!"cried Dupont, interrupting Rodin; "what gratitude do I not owe
you!"Now, my dear sir, you flatter me in your turn; but I ought to tell you,
that I'm obliged to annex a small condition to my support.""The person who is about to inhabit this mansion, is an old lady in every
way worthy of veneration; Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is the name of this
respectable--"

"What, sir?"said the bailiff, interrupting Rodin; "Madame de la Sainte
Colombe the lady who has bought us out?""Yes, sir, she came last week to see the estate.My wife persists that
she is a great lady; but--between ourselves--judging by certain words
that I heard her speak--"

"You are full of penetration, my dear M. Dupont.Madame de la Sainte
Colombe is far from being a great lady.I believe she was neither more
nor less than a milliner, under one of the wooden porticoes of the Palais
Royal.You see, that I deal openly with you.""And she boasted of all the noblemen, French and foreign, who used to
visit her!""No doubt, they came to buy bonnets for their wives!However, the fact
is, that, having gained a large fortune and, after being in youth and
middle age--indifferent--alas!more than indifferent to the salvation of
her soul--Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is now in a likely way to
experience grace--which renders her, as I told you, worthy of veneration,
because nothing is so respectable as a sincere repentance--always
providing it to be lasting.Now to make the good work sure and effectual,
we shall need your assistance, my dear M."A great deal; and I will explain to you how.There is no church in this
village, which stands at an equal distance from either of two parishes.Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make choice of one of the two
clergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have long
lived in these parts, for information respecting them."in that case the choice will soon be made.The incumbent of
Danicourt is one of the best of men.""Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte
Colombe.""You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate of
Roiville, the other parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust
herself to his care.""And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?""Why?--because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de
la Sainte-Colombe to make the choice I wish, you will be certain to keep
your place as bailiff.I give you my word of it, and what I promise I
perform.""I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power," said Dupont, convinced
by Rodin's manner, and the authority of his words; "but I should like to
know--"

"One word more," said Rodin, interrupting him; "I will deal openly with
you, and tell you why I insist on the preference which I beg you to
support.I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow of an
intrigue.It is only for the purpose of doing a good action.The curate
of Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M.
d'Aigrigny feels a deep interest.Though very poor, he has to support an
aged mother.Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe, he would do more good than any one else, because he is full of
zeal and patience; and then it is clear he would reap some little
advantages, by which his old mother might profit--there you see is the
secret of this mighty scheme.When I knew that this lady was disposed to
buy an estate in the neighborhood of our friend's parish, I wrote about
it to the marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to
render him this small service, which, as you see, will not remain without
a recompense.For I tell you once more, and I will prove it, that I have
the power to keep you in your place as bailiff.""Well, sir," replied Dupont, after a moment's reflection, "you are so
frank and obliging, that I will imitate your sincerity.In the same
degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected and loved in this
country, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to prefer to him, is
dreaded for his intolerance--and, moreover--"

"Well, and what more?""Why, then, they say--"

"Come, what do they say?"Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff
was quite struck dumb with amazement--for the countenance of M. Rodin
took a singular expression when he laughed.he repeated, with
redoubled hilarity; "a Jesuit!--Now really, my dear M. Dupont, for a man
of sense, experience, and intelligence, how can you believe such idle
stories?--A Jesuit--are there such people as Jesuits?--in our time, above
all, can you believe such romance of the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old
freedom lovers?--Come, come; I wager, you have read about them in the
Constitutionnel!""And yet, sir, they say--"

"Good heavens!what will they not say?--But wise men, prudent men like
you, do not meddle with what is said--they manage their own little
matters, without doing injury to any one, and they never sacrifice, for
the sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable
provision for the rest of their days.I tell you frankly, however much I
may regret it, that should you not succeed in getting the preference for
my man, you will not remain bailiff here."But, sir," said poor Dupont, "it will not be my fault, if this lady,
hearing a great deal in praise of the other curate, should prefer him to
your friend."but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the
neighborhood--persons worthy of confidence, whom she will see every
day--tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of good of my friend,
and a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the former,
and you will continue bailiff.""But, sir--that would be calumny!"said Rodin, with an air of sorrowful and
affectionate reproach, "how can you think me capable of giving you evil
counsel?--I was only making a supposition.You wish to remain bailiff on
this estate.I offer you the certainty of doing so--it is for you to
consider and decide.""But, sir--"

"One word more--or rather one more condition--as important as the other.Unfortunately, we have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and
weakness of their penitents, unfairly to benefit either themselves or
others: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness--but, in
order to discharge my responsibility--and yours also, as you will have
contributed to his appointment--I must request that you will write to me
twice a week, giving the most exact detail of all that you have remarked
in the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe--for the influence of a confessor, you see, reveals itself in the
whole conduct of life, and I should wish to be fully edified by the
proceedings of my friend, without his being aware of it--or, if anything
blameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed of it by
this weekly correspondence.""But, sir--that would be to act as a spy?""Now, my dear M. Dupont!how can you thus brand the sweetest, most
wholesome of human desires--mutual confidence?--I ask of you nothing
else--I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details of all that
goes on here.On these two conditions, inseparable one from the other,
you remain bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief and regret,
to recommend some one else to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe.""I beg you, sir," said Dupont, with emotion, "Be generous without any
conditions!--I and my wife have only this place to give us bread, and we
are too old to find another.Do not expose our probity of forty years'
standing to be tempted by the fear of want, which is so bad a
counsellor!""My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect upon
this, and give me your answer in the course of a week."I implore you--" The conversation was here interrupted by a
loud report, which was almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of
the cliffs.Hardly had he spoken, when the
same noise was again heard more distinctly than before."It is the sound of cannon," cried Dupont, rising; "no doubt a ship in
distress, or signaling for a pilot.""My dear," said the bailiffs wife, entering abruptly, "from the terrace,
we can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismasted--they are drifting
right upon the shore--the ship is firing minute gulls--it will be lost."cried the bailiff, taking his hat and preparing to
go out, "to look on at a shipwreck, and be able to do nothing!""Can no help be given to these vessels?""If they are driven upon the reefs, no human power can save them; since
the last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast.""Lost with all on board?--Oh, very frightful," said M. Rodin."In such a storm, there is but little chance for the crew; no matter,"
said the bailiff, addressing his wife, "I will run down to the rocks with
the people of the farm, and try to save some of them, poor
creatures!--Light large fires in several rooms--get ready linen, clothes,
cordials--I scarcely dare hope to save any, but we must do our best."I should think it a duty, if I could be at all useful, but I am too old
and feeble to be of any service," said M. Rodin, who was by no means
anxious to encounter the storm."Your good lady will be kind enough to
show me the Green Chamber, and when I have found the articles I require,
I will set out immediately for Paris, for I am in great haste."Ring the big bell," said the
bailiff to his servant; "let all the people of the farm meet me at the
foot of the cliff, with ropes and levers.""Yes, my dear," replied Catherine; "but do not expose yourself.""Kiss me--it will bring me luck," said the bailiff; and he started at a
full run, crying: "Quick!quick; by this time not a plank may remain of
the vessels.""My dear madam," said Rodin, always impassible, "will you be obliging
enough to show me the Green Chamber?""Please to follow me, sir," answered Catherine, drying her tears--for she
trembled on account of her husband, whose courage she well knew.THE TEMPEST

The sea is raging.Mountainous waves of dark green, marbled with white
foam, stand out, in high, deep undulations, from the broad streak of red
light, which extends along the horizon.Above are piled heavy masses of
black and sulphurous vapor, whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish
gray, driven by the violence of the wind, rush across the murky sky.The pale winter sun, before he quite disappears in the great clouds,
behind which he is slowly mounting, casts here and there some oblique
rays upon the troubled sea, and gilds the transparent crest of some of
the tallest waves.A band of snow-white foam boils and rages as far as
the eye can reach, along the line of the reefs that bristle on this
dangerous coast.Half-way up a rugged promontory, which juts pretty far into the sea,
rises Cardoville Castle; a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows; its
brick walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this
sky loaded with vapors.A large, disabled ship, with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from
the stumps of broken masts, drives dead upon the coast.Now she rolls her
monstrous hull upon the waves--now plunges into their trough.A flash is
seen, followed by a dull sound, scarcely perceptible in the midst of the
roar of the tempest.That gun is the last signal of distress from this
lost vessel, which is fast forging on the breakers.At the same moment, a steamer, with its long plume of black smoke, is
working her way from east to west, making every effort to keep at a
distance from the shore, leaving the breakers on her left.The dismasted
ship, drifting towards the rocks, at the mercy of the wind and tide, must
some time pass right ahead of the steamer.Suddenly, the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side; the
enormous wave broke furiously on her deck; in a second the chimney was
carried away, the paddle box stove in, one of the wheels rendered
useless.A second white-cap, following the first, again struck the vessel
amidships, and so increased the damage that, no longer answering to the
helm, she also drifted towards the shore, in the same direction as the
ship.But the latter, though further from the breakers, presented a
greater surface to the wind and sea, and so gained upon the steamer in
swiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminent--a new
clanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck.The ship was an English vessel, the "Black Eagle," homeward bound from
Alexandria, with passengers, who arriving from India and Java, via the
Red Sea, had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez, from on board the
steamship "Ruyter."The "Black Eagle," quitting the Straits of Gibraltar,
had gone to touch at the Azores.She headed thence for Portsmouth, when
she was overtaken in the Channel by the northwester.The steamer was the
"William Tell," coming from Germany, by way of the Elbe, and bound, in
the last place, for Hamburg to Havre.These two vessels, the sport of enormous rollers, driven along by tide
and tempest, were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed.The
deck of each offered a terrible spectacle; the loss of crew and
passengers appeared almost certain, for before them a tremendous sea
broke on jagged rocks, at the foot of a perpendicular cliff.The captain of the "Black Eagle," standing on the poop, holding by the
remnant of a spar, issued his last orders in this fearful extremity with
courageous coolness.The smaller boats had been carried away by the
waves; it was in vain to think of launching the long-boat; the only
chance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to
pieces on touching the rocks, was to establish a communication with the
land by means of a life-line--almost the last resort for passing between
the shore and a stranded vessel.The deck was covered with passengers, whose cries and terror augmented
the general confusion.Some, struck with a kind of stupor, and clinging
convulsively to the shrouds, awaited their doom in a state of stupid
insensibility.Others wrung their hands in despair, or rolled upon the
deck uttering horrible imprecations.Here, women knelt down to pray;
there, others hid their faces in their hands, that they might not see the
awful approach of death.A young mother, pale as a specter, holding her
child clasped tightly to her bosom, went supplicating from sailor to
sailor, and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that
would take charge of her son.These cries, and tears, and terror contrasted with the stern and silent
resignation of the sailors.Knowing the imminence of the inevitable
danger, some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes,
waiting for the moment to make a last effort, to dispute their lives with
the fury of the waves; others renouncing all hope, prepared to meet death
with stoical indifference.Here and there, touching or awful episodes rose in relief, if one may so
express it, from this dark and gloomy background of despair.A young man of about eighteen or twenty, with shiny black hair, copper
<DW52> complexion, and perfectly regular and handsome features,
contemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness
peculiar to those who have often braved great perils; wrapped in a cloak,
he leaned his back against the bulwarks, with his feet resting against
one of the bulkheads.Suddenly, the unhappy mother, who, with her child
in her arms, and gold in her hand, had in vain addressed herself to
several of the mariners, to beg them to save her boy, perceiving the
young man with the copper-<DW52> complexion, threw herself on her knees
before him, and lifted her child towards him with a burst of
inexpressible agony.The young man took it, mournfully shook his head,
and pointed to the furious waves--but, with a meaning gesture, he
appeared to promise that he would at least try to save it.Then the young
mother, in a mad transport of hope, seized the hand of the youth, and
bathed it with her tears.Further on, another passenger of the "Black Eagle," seemed animated by
sentiments of the most active pity.One would hardly have given him
five-and-twenty years of age.His long, fair locks fell in curls on
either side of his angelic countenance.He wore a black cassock and white
neck-band.Applying himself to comfort the most desponding, he went from
one to the other, and spoke to them pious words of hope and resignation;
to hear him console some, and encourage others, in language full of
unction, tenderness, and ineffable charity, one would have supposed him
unaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared.On his fine, mild features, was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity,
a religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought; from time to
time, he raised to heaven his large blue eyes, beaming with gratitude,
love, and serenity, as if to thank God for having called him to one of
those formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may
devote himself for his brethren, and, if not able to rescue them at all,
at least die with them, pointing to the sky.One might almost have taken
him for an angel, sent down to render less cruel the strokes of
inexorable fate.not far from this young man's angelic beauty, there was
another being, who resembled an evil spirit!Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit, to which he held on by
means of some remaining cordage, this man looked down upon the terrible
scene that was passing on the deck.A grim, wild joy lighted up his
countenance of a dead yellow, that tint peculiar to those who spring from
the union of the white race with the East.He wore only a shirt and linen
drawers; from his neck was suspended, by a cord, a cylindrical tin box,
similar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence.The more the danger augmented, the nearer the ship came to the breakers,
or to a collision with the steamer, which she was now rapidly
approaching--a terrible collision, which would probably cause the two
vessels to founder before even they touched the rocks--the more did the
infernal joy of this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports.He
seemed to long, with ferocious impatience, for the moment when the work
of destruction should be accomplished.To see him thus feasting with
avidity on all the agony, the terror, and the despair of those around
him, one might have taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary
deities, who, in barbarous countries, preside over murder and carnage.By this time the "Black Eagle," driven by the wind and waves, came so
near the "William Tell" that the passengers on the deck of the nearly
dismantled steamer were visible from the first-named vessel.The heavy sea, which stove in
the paddle-box and broke one of the paddles, had also carried away nearly
the whole of the bulwarks on that side; the waves, entering every instant
by this large opening, swept the decks with irresistible violence, and
every time bore away with them some fresh victims.Amongst the passengers, who seemed only to have escaped this danger to be
hurled against the rocks, or crushed in the encounter of the two vessels,
one group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful interest.Taking refuge abaft, a tall old man, with bald forehead and gray
moustache, had lashed himself to a stanchion, by winding a piece of rope
round his body, whilst he clasped in his arms, and held fast to his
breast, two girls of fifteen or sixteen, half enveloped in a pelisse of
reindeer-skin.A large, fallow, Siberian dog, dripping with water, and
barking furiously at the waves, stood close to their feet.These girls, clasped in the arms of the old man, also pressed close to
each other; but, far from being lost in terror, they raised their eyes to
heaven, full of confidence and ingenuous hope, as though they expected to
be saved by the intervention of some supernatural power.A frightful shriek of horror and despair, raised by the passengers of
both vessels, was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest.At the
moment when, plunging deeply between two waves, the broadside of the
steamer was turned towards the bows of the ship, the latter, lifted to a
prodigious height on a mountain of water, remained, as it were, suspended
over the "William Tell," during the second which preceded the shock of
the two vessels.There are sights of so sublime a horror, that it is impossible to
describe them.Yet, in the midst of these catastrophes, swift as thought,
one catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture, rapid and
fleeting, as if illumined by a flash of lightning.Thus, when the "Black Eagle," poised aloft by the flood, was about to
crash down upon the "William Tell," the young man with the angelic
countenance and fair, waving locks bent over the prow of the ship, ready
to cast himself into the sea to save some victim.Suddenly, he perceived
on board the steamer, on which he looked down from the summit of the
immense wave, the two girls extending their arms towards him in
supplication.They appeared to recognize him, and gazed on him with a
sort of ecstacy and religious homage!For a second, in spite of the horrors of the tempest, in spite of the
approaching shipwreck, the looks of those three beings met.The features
of the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity; for the
maidens with their hands clasped in prayer, seemed to invoke him as their
expected Saviour.The old man, struck down by the fall of a plank, lay
helpless on the deck.A fearful mass of water dashed the "Black Eagle" down upon the "William
Tell," in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam.To the dreadful crash of
the two great bodies of wood and iron, which splintering against one
another, instantly foundered, one loud cry was added--a cry of agony and
death--the cry of a hundred human creatures swallowed up at once by the
waves!A few moments after, the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the
trough of the sea, and on the caps of the waves--with here and there the
contracted arms, the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy wretches,
striving to make their way to the reefs along the shore, at the risk of
being crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers.While the bailiff was gone to the sea-shore, to render help to those of
the passengers who might escape from the inevitable shipwreck, M. Rodin,
conducted by Catherine to the Green Chamber, had there found the articles
that he was to take with him to Paris.After passing two hours in this apartment, very indifferent to the fate
of the shipwrecked persons, which alone absorbed the attention of the
inhabitants of the Castle, Rodin returned to the chamber commonly
occupied by the bailiff, a room which opened upon a long gallery.When he
entered it he found nobody there.Under his arm he held a casket, with
silver fastenings, almost black from age, whilst one end of a large red
morocco portfolio projected from the breast-pocket of his half buttoned
great coat.Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe d'Aigrigny's secretary
been able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile, his
features would have been radiant with delight; for, just then, he was
under the influence of the most agreeable thoughts.Having placed the
casket upon a table, it was with marked satisfaction that he thus
communed with himself:

"All goes well.It was prudent to keep these papers here till this
moment, for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of
that Adrienne de Cardoville, who appears to guess instinctively what it
is impossible she should know.Fortunately, the time approaches when we
shall have no more need to fear her.Her fate will be a cruel one; it
must be so.Those proud, independent characters are at all times our
natural enemies--they are so by their very essence--how much more when
they show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous!As for La Sainte
Colombe, the bailiff is sure to act for us; between what the fool calls
his conscience, and the dread of being at his age deprived of a
livelihood, he will not hesitate.I wish to have him because he will
serve us better than a stranger; his having been here twenty years will
prevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrow-minded woman.Once in the hands of our man at Roiville, I will answer for the result.The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand: in
their youth, they serve the devil; in riper years, they make others serve
him; in their old age, they are horribly afraid of him; and this fear
must continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville, which, from
its isolated position, will make us an excellent college.As for the affair of the medals, the 13th of February approaches,
without news from Joshua--evidently, Prince Djalma is still kept prisoner
by the English in the heart of India, or I must have received letters
from Batavia.The daughters of General Simon will be detained at Leipsic
for at least a month longer.All our foreign relations are in the best
condition.As for our internal affairs--"

 Here M. Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the
entrance of Madame Dupont, who was zealously engaged in preparations to
give assistance in case of need."Now," said she to the servant, "light a fire in the next room; put this
warm wine there; your master may be in every minute.""Well, my dear madam," said Rodin to her, "do they hope to save any of
these poor creatures?"He is so courageous, so imprudent, if
once he thinks he can be of any service.""Courageous even to imprudence," said Rodin to himself, impatiently; "I
do not like that.""Well," resumed Catherine, "I have here at hand my hot linen, my
cordials--heaven grant it may all be of use!""We may at least hope so, my dear madam.I very much regretted that my
age and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband.I
also regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions, and to
wish him joy if successful--for I am unfortunately compelled to depart,
my moments are precious.I shall be much obliged if you will have the
carriage got ready.""Yes, Sir; I will see about it directly.""One word, my dear, good Madame Dupont.You are a woman of sense, and
excellent judgment.Now I have put your husband in the way to keep, if he
will, his situation as bailiff of the estate--"

"Is it possible?Without this place
what would become of us at our time of life?""I have only saddled my promise with two conditions--mere trifles--he
will explain all that to you."we shall regard you as our deliverer."Only, on two little conditions--"

"If there were a hundred, sir we should gladly accept them.Think what we
should be without this place--penniless--absolutely penniless!""I reckon upon you then; for the interest of your husband, you will try
to persuade him."here's master come back," cried a servant,
rushing into the chamber."No, missus; he is alone."A few moments after, M. Dupont entered the room; his clothes were
streaming with water; to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm, he
had tied it down to his head by means of his cravat, which was knotted
under his chin; his gaiters were covered with chalky stains."There I have thee, my dear love!"cried his wife, tenderly embracing
him."Up to the present moment--THREE SAVED."said Rodin; "at least your efforts
will not have been all in vain.""I only speak of those I saw myself, near the little creek of Goelands.Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast.""Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts.""And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?"asked Rodin,
who could not avoid remaining a few instants longer."They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people.As they cannot
walk very fast, I ran on before to console my wife, and to take the
necessary measures for their reception.First of all, my dear, you must
get ready some women's clothes.""There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?""There are two girls--fifteen or sixteen years of age at the most--mere
children--and so pretty!"said Rodin, with an affectation of interest."The person to whom they owe their lives is with them."Yes; only fancy--"

"You can tell me all this by and by.Just slip on this dry warm
dressing-gown, and take some of this hot wine."I'll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death.I was telling you that
the person who saved these young girls was a hero; and certainly his
courage was beyond anything one could have imagined.When I left here
with the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path, and
arrived at the foot of the cliff--near the little creek of Goelands,
fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous
masses of rock stretching out into the sea.Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their feet
still in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as though
they had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from the
sea."said M. Rodin, raising, as usual,
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as though to
dry a tear, which was very seldom visible."What struck me was their great resemblance to each other," resumed the
bailiff; "only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the
difference.""Twin--sisters, no doubt," said Madame Dupont."One of the poor things," continued the bailiff, "held between her
clasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from her neck by
a chain of the same material."Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last
words of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color
spread itself over his livid cheeks.In any other person, these symptoms
would have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for
long years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no
ordinary excitement.Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a
slightly agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: "It was
doubtless a pious relic.Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?""No, sir; I did not think of it.""And the two young girls were like one another--very much like, you say?""So like, that one would hardly know which was which.Probably they are
orphans, for they are dressed in mourning."said M. Rodin, with another start."As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place where
the sand was quite dry.While we were busy about this, we saw the head of
a man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to climb,
clinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick of
time, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of our
men.It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content with
having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had
attempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst
the rocks and breakers--but his strength failed him, and, without the aid
of our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to
which he clung."Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to
this conversation.The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,
only increased upon reflection.The two girls, who had just been saved,
were fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that
one might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain
with a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters
of General Simon.But how could those sisters be amongst the number of
shipwrecked passengers?How could they have escaped from the prison at
Leipsic?How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it?Could
they have fled, or had they been set at liberty?How was it possible that
he should not be apprise of such an event?But these secondary thoughts,
which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were
swallowed up in the one fact: "the daughters of General Simon are
here!"--His plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed."When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls," resumed the
bailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin's absence of
mind, "you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?--well, he is
altogether the reverse.He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet
face, and light, curling locks.I left him a cloak to cover him, for he
had nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black
worsted stockings--which struck me as singular.""Why, it was certainly not a sailor's dress.""Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a Frenchman,
for he speaks our language as well as we do.What brought the tears to my
eyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to themselves.As soon
as they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet, and seemed to look up
to him and thank him, as one would pray.Then they cast their eyes around
them, as if in search of some other person, and, having exchanged a few
words, they fell sobbing into each other's arms."How many poor creatures must have
perished!""When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven dead
bodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages.I spoke to some of
the coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and if, as
I hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought here.But surely that is the sound of voices!--yes, it is our shipwrecked
guests!"The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room--that door, which
opened on the long gallery--whilst Rodin, biting convulsively his flat
nails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers.A
touching picture soon presented itself to his view.From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by
several windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly.This group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to
whom they owed their lives.Rose and Blanche were on either side of their
deliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly
on their arms.Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of
this man made him appear younger.His long, fair hair, parted on the
forehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,
with which he had been covered.It would be difficult to describe the
adorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the
most ideal creations of Raphael's pencil--for that divine artist alone
could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite features, the
serenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue as those of an
archangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous
head.just above his light eyebrows, and rendered
still more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a
wound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair
forehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!)his hands had been
cruelly pierced by a crucifixion--his feet had suffered the same
injury--and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that his
wounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,
the adopted son of Dagobert's wife.He was a priest and martyr--for, in
our days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars flung
the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.Yes, in our days, the children of the people--for it is almost always
amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be
found--the children of the people, led by an honorable conviction,
because it is courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to
try and propagate their faith, and brave both torture and death with the
most unpretending valor.How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure
and unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!--And for
these humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith and
their intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they
seldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church.Never
does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated
limbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.[8]

In their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as
they recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able
to ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of
sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain
death.The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces
were deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears
were on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both
from agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that
they should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was
to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to
climb the rocks.Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the
soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on
one side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a
nature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
such imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of
General Simon's daughters, was a little softened.It must not be
forgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of
February, was essential to the success of Rodin's projects.The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,
approached them with eagerness.Just then a farm-boy entered the room,
crying: "Sir!good news--two more saved from the wreck!""Blessing and praise to God for it!"asked the bailiff, hastening towards the door."There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin; the
other was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a
litter made of branches.""I will run and have him placed in the room below," said the bailiff, as
he went out."Catherine, you can look to the young ladies.""And the shipwrecked man who can walk--where is he?""Here he is," said the peasant, pointing to some one who came rapidly
along the gallery; "when he heard that the two young ladies were safe in
the chateau--though he is old, and wounded in the head, he took such
great strides, that it was all I could do to get here before him."Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,
springing up by a common impulse, flew to the door.They arrived there at
the same moment as Dagobert.The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the
threshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while
Spoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the
orphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down
altogether, but for the care of the peasants.In spite of the
observations of the bailiff's wife, on their state of weakness and
agitation, the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was
carried fainting into an adjoining apartment.At sight of the soldier, Rodin's face was again violently contracted, for
he had till then believed that the guide of General Simon's daughters was
dead.The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning upon a chair,
and had not yet perceived Rodin.A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the
room, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him.This man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,
approached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign
accent: "Prince Djalma has just been brought in here.His first word was
to ask for you."cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder; for, at the
name of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel's side.exclaimed the missionary, falling back in surprise."M. Rodin," cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that moment, he
kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air of
deference, not unmixed with fear.repeated Rodin, in an excited tone."Did
he not utter the name of Prince Djalma?""Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English
ship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been wrecked.This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship that
brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and
being likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I
embarked on board the 'Black Eagle,' where I met Prince Djalma.We were
bound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to proceed to
France."This new shock had completely
paralyzed his thoughts.At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,
which he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: "Can you tell
me who this Prince Djalma is?""A young man as good as brave--the son of an East Indian king,
dispossessed of his territory by the English."Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to
him with anxious interest: "How is the Prince?"They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal," answered the
other.said the missionary, addressing Rodin; "here, you
see, is another saved.""So much the better," observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious tone."I will go see him," said Gabriel, submissively."You have no orders to
give me?""Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,
notwithstanding your fatigue?"Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair,
while the missionary went out with the peasant.The man with the sallow
complexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the
Stranglers.Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of
Tchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the
despatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter
by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the
"Ruyter."When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi, he had not
been seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on shipboard, after
his escape (which we shall explain by and by), not knowing that he
belonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the voyage as a
fellow-countryman.Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,
biting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half
caste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
shoulder, said to him: "Your name is Rodin?"asked the other, starting, and raising his head abruptly."You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?"But, once more, what do you want?""Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!"And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had
passed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed
before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.[8] We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or
three years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son
of poor parents in Beauce.He was writing to his mother from the heart of
Japan, and thus concluded his letter: "Adieu, my dear mother!they say
there is much danger where I am now sent to.Pray for me, and tell all
our good neighbors that I think of them very often."These few words,
addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of France,
are only the more touching from their very simplicity--E. S.




CHAPTER XXVI.The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House.The tempest
has lulled by degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse
murmur of the waves, as they wash heavily the shore.Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
apartments on the first-floor of the chateau.Djalma, too severely hurt
to be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below.At the moment of
the shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms.He had
failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
death, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when
thrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces.Faringhea, who has
been able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the
chamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be
ready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried
his clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,
placed in front of a bright coal-fire.His apartment is situated near
those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has
quitted the door of Rose and Blanche's chamber, to lie down and warm
himself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a
feeling of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and
sea.We will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old
Jovial; unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his
irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with,
ever since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was
the most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters
entered timidly.Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed
themselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert;
though the bailiff's wife, after showing them to their room, had returned
again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the
hurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to
the chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was
sleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing
their canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert
reposing there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe.To their great
astonishment, they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion,
not daring to advance or recede, for fear of waking him.The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled
naturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion
was the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of
the damask covering of the arm-chair.His beautiful countenance expressed
a profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful
dream, or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some
sad regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was
sleeping.Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features
preserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with
an inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering
goodness.The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed
simultaneously, and exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each
other the slumbering missionary."He sleeps, sister," said Rose in a low voice."So much the better," replied Blanche, also in a whisper, making a sign
of caution; "we shall now be able to observe him well.""Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.""He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.""But here, at least, he is visible.""Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.""And so--he has again rescued us.""Without him, we should have perished this morning.""And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance
shone with light.""Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.""And then he had not so sad a mien.""That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.""But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?""If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?"If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or in
helping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?"If he did not run any danger for those he protects, it
would be less noble.""What a pity that he does not open his eye!""Their expression is so good, so tender!""Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?""We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.""If we were to pray to him to speak to us?"The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a
bright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently
beneath their black dresses.said Blanche, believing rightly, that
Rose felt exactly as she did."And yet it seems to do us good.It is as
if some happiness were going to befall us."The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with
clasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young
priest.Turning their lovely faces towards
him, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to
their youthful appearance: "Gabriel!On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,
and, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,
beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle
voices repeat his name.said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.It was now Gabriel's turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he
had saved.said he to them; "you should kneel only
unto God."The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the
hand."You know my name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile."Yes--when you came from our mother."said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of
the orphans.I saw you to-day for the first time.""Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams.""In Germany--three months ago, for the first time.Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who
expected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more
perplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?""Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.""And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we
remembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.""Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that
dark night, when we were not able to see you?""What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our
old friend?""We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he
would not believe in angels.""And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.""This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your
assistance.I was coming from America, but I have never been in Leipsic.I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison.Tell me, my sisters,"
added he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?""For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother
from heaven to protect us.""My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest.It is by mere chance, no
doubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
dreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner--for angels are
not visible to mortal eye.said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each
other."No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by
the hand; "dreams, like everything else, come from above.Since the
remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream, it is twice
blessed."At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance.Up to
this time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert's wife had
adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a
priest and missionary.The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
blank wound (to use a term of General Simon's), had allowed it to be
carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black
bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the
natural grimness of his features.On entering the room, he was not a
little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
familiarly in his own.This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not
know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had
attempted to save his also.In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving
to cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very
imperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain
death, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety
beneath the roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated,
into a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his
wound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features of
the missionary.The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray
brows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the
sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with
filial caresses.His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious
glance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose
countenance he could not well distinguish."They told us it was not
dangerous.""No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this
manner.If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more
wrappings.They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank
wound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised one
of his hands to the bandage."How can you be
so unreasonable--at your age?"I will do what you wish, and keep it on."Then,
drawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to them in a low
voice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his eye:
"Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?He has
very much the look of a curate.You see, my children, you must be on your
guard; because--"

"He?"cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel."Without him,
we should not now be here to kiss you."cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure,
and gazing full at the missionary."It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche."Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the
shipwreck."it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more.With swelling heart,
and tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered him both his
hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe: "Sir,
I owe you the lives of these two children.I feel what a debt that
service lays upon me.I will not say more--because it includes
everything!"Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop!when I
was trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves,
was it not you that held out your hand to me?Yes--that light hair--that
youthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am sure of it!""Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see you
fall back into the sea.""I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already
said," answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: "in preserving these
children you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life.added the soldier, with admiration; "and so
young, with such a girlish look!""And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to
the priest.repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.asked the soldier, with increasing
astonishment."An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of mothers:
for she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as her
son.""Frances Baudoin--was it not?""It was, sir," answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn."Yes, of a brave soldier--who, from the most admirable devotion, is even
now passing his life in exile--far from his wife--far from his son, my
dear brother--for I am proud to call him by that name--"

"My Agricola!--my wife!--when did you leave them?"You the father of Agricola?--Oh!I knew not, until
now," cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, "I knew not all the
gratitude that I owed to heaven!"resumed Dagobert, in a trembling voice; "how are
they?"The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.""No; it is too much," cried Dagobert; "it is too much!"The veteran was
unable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and fell back
exhausted in a chair.And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father's
letter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of
Dagobert had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent
joy."Our Gabriel is the same as yours--what happiness!"he belongs to you as well as to me.Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with
affectionate warmth: "Your hand, my brave boy!"Yes--that's it--thank me!--after all thou has done for us!""Does my adopted mother know of your return?"asked Gabriel, anxious to
escape from the praises of the soldier."I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come alone;
there was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by.Does she still
live in the Rue Brise-Miche?"In that case, she must have received my letter.I wished to write to her
from the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.""Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I should
be still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had a
hand in--a good sort of devil, though.""That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself.These little
ladies," he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche, "pretended
to know more about it than I did, and were continually repeating: 'It was
the angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert--the good angel we told
thee of--though you said you would rather have Spoil sport to defend
us--'"

"Gabriel, I am waiting for you," said a stern voice, which made the
missionary start.They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog uttered
a deep growl.He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor.His
features were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance
at the soldier and sisters.said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in favor of
Rodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive."What the
mischief does he want?""I must go with him," answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful
constraint.Then, turning to Rodin, he added: "A thousand pardons!cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, "going the very instant
we have just met?I have too much to
tell you, and to ask in return.It
will be a real treat for me."He is my superior, and I must obey him.""Your superior?--why, he's in citizen's dress.""He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb."since he is not in uniform, and there is no provost-marshal in
your troop, send him to the--"

"Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to
remain.""I was right in disliking the phi of that man," muttered Dagobert between
his teeth.Then he added, with an air of impatience and vexation: "Shall
I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off by himself?""I beg you not to do so," said Gabriel; "it would be useless; I know my
duty, and have no will but my superior's.As soon as you arrive in Paris,
I will come and see you, as also my adopted mother, and my dear brother,
Agricola."I have been a soldier, and know what subordination
is," said Dagobert, much annoyed."One must put a good face on bad
fortune.So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue Brise-Miche, my boy; for
they tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow evening, and we set out
almost immediately.But I say--there seems to be a strict discipline with
you fellows!""Yes, it is strict and severe," answered Gabriel, with a shudder, and a
stifled sigh."Come, shake hands--and let's say farewell for the present.After all,
twenty-four hours will soon pass away."replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he returned
the friendly pressure of the veteran's hand.added the orphans, sighing also, and with tears in
their eyes.said Gabriel--and he left the room with Rodin, who
had not lost a word or an incident of this scene.Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
Paris, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too
much injured to proceed on his journey.The half-caste, Faringhea,
remained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow
countryman.We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of
Dagobert's wife.The following scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the
shipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House.Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one
end of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the
little square of the Cloister, near the church.At this end, the street,
or rather alley--for it is not more than eight feet wide--is shut in
between immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of
which excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the
year, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,
during the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate
everything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of
oblong well.It was about eight o'clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish light of
the street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men, stopping at
the angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few words together."So," said one, "you understand all about it.You are to watch in the
street, till you see them enter No."And when you see 'em enter so as to make quite sure of the game, go up
to Frances Baudoin's room--"

"Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
lives--the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.""Yes--and you must try and find out her address also--from her humpbacked
sister, if possible--for it is very important.Women of her feather
change their nests like birds, and we have lost track of her.""Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her
sister hangs out.""And, to give you steam, I'll wait for you at the tavern opposite the
Cloister, and we'll have a go of hot wine on your return.""I'll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold."This morning the water friz on my sprinkling-brush,
and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the church-door.a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses!""Luckily, you have the pickings--"

"Well, well--good luck to you!Don't forget the Fiver, the little passage
next to the dyer's shop."One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end
of the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry.This latter soon
found the number of the house he sought--a tall, narrow building, having,
like all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and
forwards in front of the door of No.If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor
of the interior cannot be described.5 was, in a special
degree, dirty and dilapidated.The water, which oozed from the wall,
trickled down the dark and filthy staircase.On the second floor, a wisp
of straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet
on; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the
sickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the
putrid exhalations of the drains.The few openings, cut at rare intervals
in the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint
rays of glimmering light.In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,
poor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working
classes.A dyer occupied the
ground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the
stench of the whole building.On the upper stories, several artisans
lodged with their families, or carried on their different trades.Up four
flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert.It consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by
a single candle.Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
wall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron
rod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often
washed, had preserved its natural color.At one end of this room was a
round iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes.On the wooden
table, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made
of iron--a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola
Baudoin, Dagobert's son.A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several
branches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very
coarsely, bore witness to the habits of the soldier's wife.Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously
fashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with
green cotton velvet (Agricola's first present to his mother), a few rush
bottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,
brown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a
worm-eaten door.The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and
household utensils.Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so
to the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two
mattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press
contained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert's wife occupied all to herself a
room as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to honest
and laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together--only too
happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets and
blankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker's.Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and
damp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son
Agricola's evening meal.Dagobert's wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close jacket of
blue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a white
handkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.Her
countenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive of
resignation and great kindness.It would have been difficult to find a
better, a more courageous mother.With no resource but her labor, she had
succeeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son
Agricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with
admirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later
life, by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most
violent exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost
suicidal.Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the
present), by sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn
about two shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to
educate her son and her adopted child.At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength
nearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing,
and had received such an education as children of the people can obtain.About this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and
Gabriel prepared to enter the priest's seminary, under the active
patronage of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances
Baudoin had become very frequent about the year 1820.This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those
simple natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial
approaches to heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life
of martyrdom--pure and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart
supply the place of the intellect!The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
simplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed
in yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had
now for many years been accustomed to submit.She regarded this influence
as most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration,
could have prevented her from obeying it.Did any dispute arise on the
subject, nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every
argument a resistance entirely free from passion--mild as her
disposition, calm as her conscience--but, like the latter, not to be
shaken.In a word, Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but
uninstructed and credulous beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and
dangerous hands, become, without knowing it, the instruments of much
evil.For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the
increasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;
unable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest
of her time at church.Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
working to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth
for her son's supper, with maternal care and solicitude.She took from
the press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very much
battered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut
like a knife.These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she
rubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her
son's plate.They were the most precious of her possessions, not so much
for what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the
associations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,
under the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been
compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker's.Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,
and one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her
son's plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of the
supper.Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his
mother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the
redness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal.After long
and painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the
conviction that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker,
would soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or
three hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors.Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her
eyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts
of work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she
had at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags
for the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the
rate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread.This work,
being very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and
her gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,
whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or
sickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices
to bring them in daily this miserable pittance.Thus do their gains
diminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and
infirmity must occasion.Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son.A first-rate
workman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his
labor brought him from four to five shillings a day--more than double
what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments.Admitting
therefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain
both her and himself.But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself
even some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously
liberal on the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of
visiting daily the parish church.Scarcely a day passed but she had
masses sung, or tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been
so long separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she
considered on the high-road to perdition.Agricola had so excellent a
heart, so loved and revered his mother, and considered her actions in
this respect inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never
complained when he saw a great part of his week's wages (which he paid
regularly over to his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect
as tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations
injurious at her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional
expenses.But what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when
she replied with tears: "My child, 'tis for the salvation of your father
and yours too."To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a
subject which Agricola, through respect for his mother's religious faith,
never discussed.He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her
dispense with comforts she might have enjoyed.THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very
much deformed.Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her
breast was sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders.Her face was
regular, but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it
expressed great sweetness and melancholy.Her blue eyes beamed with
kindness and intelligence.By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest
woman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse
net at the back of her head.Though
miserably clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful
struggle with her poverty.Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty
frock made of print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it
had been so often washed, that its primitive design and color had long
since disappeared.In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a
long familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of
taunting.From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her.We have said
that she was very deformed, and she was vulgarly called "Mother Bunch."Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every
moment reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though
they felt as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her,
never called her, however, by any other name.Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the
house in which Dagobert's wife had resided for more than twenty years;
and she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.There are wretches fatally doomed to misery.Mother Bunch had a very
pretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow
of a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she
treated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness.The latter would
often come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console
her, and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.Accustomed to pity her by their mother's example, instead of imitating
other children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her, Agricola
and Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when
their mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty.Cephyse was
intelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the
lively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and
pleasures--a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.Cephyse, listening at first to Frances's good advice, resigned herself to
her lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for about a
year.But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
insignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her
to--privations which often bordered on starvation--Cephyse, young,
pretty, of warm temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and
seductions--brilliant, indeed, for her, since they offered food to
satisfy her hunger, shelter from the cold, and decent raiment, without
being obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome
hovel--Cephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyer's clerk, who
forsook her soon after.She formed a connection with another clerk, whom
she (instructed by the examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman,
whom she afterwards cast off for other favorites.In a word, what with
changing and being forsaken, Cephyse, in the course of one or two years,
was the idol of a set of grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired
such a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her
decision of character, original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all
kinds of pleasures, and especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was
termed the Bacchanal Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of
this bewildering royalty.From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
intervals.She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain
her three-and-six a week.The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing
by Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army.For
these she received half-a-crown a dozen.They had to be hemmed, stitched,
provided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at
the most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely
succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week--an
excessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and
fourpence a week.And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental
nor uncommon.And this, because the remuneration given for women's work
is an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism.They are paid
not half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as tailors,
and makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.--no doubt because women can
work as well as men--because they are more weak and delicate--and because
their need may be twofold as great when they become mothers.Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week.That is to say,
toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in
keeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and
poverty--so numerous were her privations.The word
privation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all
that is necessary to preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome
air and shelter, sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing.Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all
that is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society
ought--yes--ought necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman
and workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed them of all
territorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at
least, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the
sea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for
shelter and for fuel.The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts,
considering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard
daily labor, which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable
him to live in the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less.For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life
from the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger,
and disease?And to show how far the mortification which society imposes
thus inexorably on its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its
careless disregard of all the questions which concern the just
remuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl
contrived to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
wretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which
leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity.Yes: to live at such a price is virtue!Yes, society thus organized,
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame
the poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because
they are cold and famishing.This poor girl spent her wages as follows:

    Six pounds of bread, second quality..0 8 1/2
    Four pails of water..0 2
    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5
    Coarse salt..0 0 3/4

                                                       2 7

To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
week at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story.There remained nine or ten pence a week
for clothes and lodging.By rare good fortune, her situation was in one
respect an exception to the lot of many others.Agricola, that he might
not wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the
housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a
small bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
shillings a year.But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the
porter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which
was twelve and sixpence.The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a
month left for her other expenses.But many workwomen, whose position is
less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a
piece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at
night patronize the "twopenny rope," one with another, in a wretched room
containing five or six beds, some of which are always engaged by men, as
male lodgers are by far the most abundant.Yes; and in spite of the
disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she
must submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have separate rooms
for females.To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor workwoman must
possess three or four shillings in ready money.But how save this sum,
out of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely
sufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less sufficient to
clothe her?The poor wretch must resign herself to this repugnant
cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes
weakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay
life," becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only means of improving
her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man made of money,"
who can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the
depravity of the lower orders!And yet, painful as the condition of the
working woman is, it is relatively fortunate.Should work fail her for
one day, two days, what then?Should sickness come--sickness almost
always occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary
attention, and good rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work
impossible; though not so dangerous as to procure the sufferer a bed in
an hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then?The mind
hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and
often of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again
this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts
whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
creatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly
enjoyed through Agricola's generosity, lived very miserably; and her
health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant
hardships.Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little
sacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she
earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service
which it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited
means of Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her
natural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and
humiliations.But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and
generous soul--a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that
this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been
brought up, and who had naturally the gift.This poor girl was the first
confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and
when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic
reverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong
natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would
be to her in her lonely and despised condition.One day, to Agricola's great surprise, who had just read some verses to
her, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to
him also a poetic composition.Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,
perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint
entrusted to a friendly hearer.From that day Agricola and she held
frequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but
with this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl's poetical
essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak
intellect.This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her
unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard
lot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding, but resigned; it was
especially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of
angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the
double burden of poverty and deformity.Yet she often expressed a sincere
free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she
admired beauty as she admired the sun.many were the verses of
hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine
face; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous
heart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits.The
young girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can
love, who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in
the depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation.She
did not seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so?Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola
explained the interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one
was surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830,
Agricola, after fighting intrepidly for the people's flag, was brought
bleeding home to his mother.Dagobert's son, deceived, like others, on
this point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect, this
love for him.Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
preparing her son's supper."Is it you, my poor love," said she; "I have not seen you since morning:
have you been ill?The young girl kissed Agricola's mother, and replied: "I was very busy
about some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have only
just finished it.I am going down to fetch some charcoal--do you want
anything while I'm out?""No, no, my child, thank you.It is half-past
eight, and Agricola is not come home."Then she added, after a sigh: "He
kills himself with work for me.Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl; my sight
is quite going.In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I cannot
see at all--not even to sew sacks.The idea of being a burden to my son
drives me distracted.""Oh, don't, ma'am, if Agricola heard you say that--"

"I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my
vexation.Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the
advantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy's, his good and worthy
master--instead of living in this dull garret, where it is scarcely light
at noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very little expense,
a good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a view of the
garden.not to mention that this place is so
far from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to it.""Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs.Baudoin," said
Mother Bunch; "besides, he knows how you cling to the house in which he
was born.M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola, in the
building put up for the workmen.""Yes, my child; but then I must give up church."But--be easy, I hear him," said the hunchback, blushing.A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs."At least, I'll not let him see that I have been crying," said the good
mother, drying her tears."This is the only moment of rest and ease from
toil he has--I must not make it sad to him."Our blacksmith poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of
age, was alert and robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and
aquiline nose, and an open, expressive countenance.His resemblance to
Dagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache which he
wore according to the fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his
chin.His cheeks, however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a
blue blouse, bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly
round his muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his
dress.The only thing which contrasted singularly with his working
habiliments was a handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he
held in his hand."Good-evening, mother," said he, as he came to kiss Frances immediately.Then, with a friendly nod, he added, "Good-evening, Mother Bunch.""You are very late, my child," said Frances, approaching the little stove
on which her son's simple meal was simmering; "I was getting very
anxious.""Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?"you won't excuse me for keeping the nice little supper
waiting that you get ready for me, for fear it should be spoilt, eh?"So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again."Have done, you naughty boy; you'll make me upset the pan.""That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully."I'll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I'm so
fond of."said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach."True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with
Mother Bunch; "but, talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages.""Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put
away the money, "what a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola."See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at
it, admire it, and especially smell it.You can't have a sweeter perfume;
a blending of vanilla and orange blossom.""Indeed, it does smell nice, child.said
Frances, admiringly; "where did you find it?"repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think
folks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue
Brise-Miche?"inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances's
curiosity.Well, I'll satisfy you, and explain why I
came home so late; for something else detained me.It has been an evening
of adventures, I promise you.I was hurrying home, when I heard a low,
gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just about
dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my
fist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its
paws.""Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands.Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that
did not bear the master's name, I looked beneath it, and saw a small
collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains.So I took a Lucifer
match from my 'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, 'FRISKY belongs
to Hon.Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No."Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I
came to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a
small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park.So,
looking up I saw 'No.7,' newly painted over a little door with a grated
slide.I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in observing me
through the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through),
the gate opened.And now, you'll not believe a word I have to say."said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her namesake of
elfish history.I am quite astounded, even now, at my
adventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.""Well, let us have it," said the worthy mother, so deeply interested that
she did not perceive her son's supper was beginning to burn."First," said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had excited, "a
young lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so beautifully and
gracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a beautiful
portrait of past times.Before I could say a word, she exclaimed, 'Ah!dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how happy Miss Adrienne will
be!Come, pray come in instantly; she would so regret not having an
opportunity to thank you in person!'And without giving me time to reply,
she beckoned me to follow her.Oh, dear mother, it is quite out of my
power to tell you, the magnificence I saw, as I passed through a small
saloon, partially lighted, and full of perfume!A door opened,--Oh, such a sight!I
was so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of gold and
light, crystal and flowers; and, amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady
of extreme beauty--ideal beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair
shining like gold!She had black eyes, ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as
snow.This is all I can recollect: for, as I said before, I was so
dazzled, I seemed to be looking through a veil.'Madame,' said the young
woman, whom I never should have taken for a lady's-maid, she was dressed
so elegantly, 'here is Frisky.This gentleman found him, and brought him
back.''Oh, sir,' said the young lady with the golden hair, in a sweet
silvery voice, 'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to
Frisky.'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank
me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to
me, though I must confess with some hesitation--'No doubt, sir, it gave
you some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some
valuable time--allow me--' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my
looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
at having wounded me, she said--'At least, sir, you will accept this
flower.'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she
understood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring
to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady's kind manner,
there was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall
and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the
red-haired young lady, 'He is here, Madame.'She immediately rose and
said to me, 'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am
indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all
occasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young
woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there
I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had
come out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on
seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done
in her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and
feeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and
generous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any
important case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,
towards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within
the reach of a work, girl's vision; but, making an involuntary comparison
of this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt
more cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and
gentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made
her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my
adventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now
for the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with
an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?'said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since
it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or
not."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,
containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected
gesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid
blush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this
handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do
you give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as
a pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to
think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this
flower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,
pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses
yesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
the flower against the side of it."Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,
"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
better for a little cooling to-night, won't it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's
head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is
late.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every
evening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a
good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since
I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better
seat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only
just dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never
prevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all
alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of
stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
day's toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,
during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast
without complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman
accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have
some more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of
luxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do
to-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem
very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not
satisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little
amusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you
did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said
Frances to her son.I don't propose the theatre; but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will
simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly
three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
us.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the
eyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
refusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck
his forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
punctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
mother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
might not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,
thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
of her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man
retorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
stoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola
left his mother's arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain
attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may
conceive the blacksmith's regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:
she is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with
a respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you
might have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I
regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do
you want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at
my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought
her proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young
person is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to
night; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
his moustache with pride."But that does not
astonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and
Dagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who
preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother
Bunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him
rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old
soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did
not light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night;" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced
towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep
with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will
share the young blacksmith's room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on
the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
post about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's
confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to
Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described
the most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A
flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
the roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so
nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be
seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who
had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks
were downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one
hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened
with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of
Agricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,
usually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion
by which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a
letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by
post in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the
housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some
trivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his
family.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
opened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low
voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But
what is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she
hastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the
light, and read what follows:

"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
to-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied
amazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyes:-"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared
libellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who
was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,
doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:

"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
trial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
whose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance
resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good
Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on
me.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the
time.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating
tone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and
listen to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two
months since my song was published.It is not in any way political;
indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very
neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the
verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness!If so, justice
would be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her
steps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to
me!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you
do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;
you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble
heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and
the wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your
wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than
you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these
times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
persons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And
then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite
insignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for
conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and
he was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the
letter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be
naturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,
and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them
without you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the
letter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error
though it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without
hearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,
bitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his
daily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my
mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.
Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,
that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their
persecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
added: "But no!After all, I had
rather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it
be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my
family will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen
to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep
so joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
democratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she
showed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a
generous heart.You must apply to her--"

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done
with this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "'Remember my name; and
in all circumstances address yourself to me?'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to
morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
support.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for
him.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
will have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what
could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you
understand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose
that you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety
for you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your
employment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,
Agricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is
noble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is
generous.The required surety will be
as nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be
the very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and
dejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the
young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is
true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any
other person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am
sure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far
above me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;
yes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that
which I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
heart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
youth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,
holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,
"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and
delicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over
into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally
devoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,
they sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the
world is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and
affection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to
hardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of
themselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
lady's house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I'll go down to watch at the
street-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you
of what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your
father," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,
is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your
present concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and
the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:

"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is
over; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet
him.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's
apartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest
its noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,
gayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my
dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not
seen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola's garret
being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite
of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the
conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
possessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she
loved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that
she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,
she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear
and cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's
garret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be
seen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
reverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of
Agricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,
suspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the
edge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had
dressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both
those of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I
wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
moustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;
have you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That's right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look
ye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good
for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old
carbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;
and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is
something good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for
the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this
is but the beginning!I am like the famished
wretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and
little that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to
be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,
I wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and
perplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed
that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
menaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good
to you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more
equitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in
his factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies
of Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what
affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;
who work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that
is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"
observed Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good
mother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a
sigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have
suffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well
in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You
shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in
beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold
father and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You
will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
are of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down
to say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes
to be regular at that: the good soul!and
during her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required
in a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.
Hardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must
be deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which
sustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put
off for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only
hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my
Agricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his
son's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now
that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of
business.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in
Paris?""I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some
important papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this
notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my
journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect
it."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
were two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as
thought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
while they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
become moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the
young men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at
length."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a
hundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping
for it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands
of Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a
hundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting
his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of
ineffable affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel
has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he
saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine
also."suddenly exclaimed
Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which
extended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the
young missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,
Dagobert said:

"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with
renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest
held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has
wounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the
missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken
down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon
which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and
agony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to
this upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands
have been pierced through!and Agricola became
grievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky
Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when
Providence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;
"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it
that they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be
implanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in
him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
and respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:
"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to
be about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took
with transport both of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as
glorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by
profession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,
with enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
resignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have
gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with
me?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes
of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every
one--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you
not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,
unarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by
artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,
alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await
death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,
without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness
issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and
this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe!can you still contend that you are not
as brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a
thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never
change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to
Dagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense
awaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I
will not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much
virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood
insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who
are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly
lawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their
vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
enfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
understand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"
and then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change
the conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:
be more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your
courage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the
spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling
heart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most
surprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by
night,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our
possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of
the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this
feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following
morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once
more to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm
became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my
horse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man
is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are
greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have
never abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
that the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my
request, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied
the missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived
by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I
awaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must
have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has
remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I
should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"

Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,
young and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the
distressed!'"asked Dagobert, singularly
interested."'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied," answered
the missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of
America--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,
where the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But
the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour
since broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have
been watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing
alarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure
you, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But
I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been
stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father
and me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother
has requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not
delay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should
depart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were
forgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to
yourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I'll come down."I'll come up
again to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,
to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his
garret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received
this letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:

"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon
with an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to
no other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General
Simon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address
was Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,
"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would
withdraw his father for about two days, during which time his
(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it
is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is
required on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall
be back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and
Gabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them
company.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not
possible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing
a sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again
into this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the
shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you
enrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of
the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is
already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock."This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
latter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him
to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him
solemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"
added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I
not?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will
you come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
accents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,
what could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon
us," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father
and a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I'll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest's
robe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,
that you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and
fearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A
FATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,
in Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing
than the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with
small squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre
effect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which
the fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was
surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
an arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front
overlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,
on this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,
formed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of
flowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de
Cardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,
lighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of
smaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
entire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic
clumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
the Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its
own, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them
a young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
breed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the
peristyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the
beautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth
year.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a
more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth
more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or
form smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,
Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,
with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with
rose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful
fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray
levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large
tuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a
hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,
surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and
flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,
reaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When
Georgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more
quickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful
ankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in
white silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish
satin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when
vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a
joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless
for the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had
introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was
not much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that
they trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and
petulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after
the happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon
the greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,
who advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
stopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in
advance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held
herself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up
of the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,
though of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy
consisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the
color of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was
pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;
he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs
sallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and
altogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a
"church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a
woman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was
dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay
and showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat
of the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in
her youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,
which were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and
austere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and
discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess
Saint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two
women present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even
to the animals which attended them.Mary moved to the office.There were similar differences
between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When
the latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a
movement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the
young lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the
apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,
and even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the
cur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of
distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly
said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly
animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to
what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal
a smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It
regards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to
herself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken
your mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will
not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied
Georgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the
saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained
persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if
for ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest
coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having
been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even
unto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a
hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess's house, who has
too many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the
house.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,
and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter's
lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the
cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing
the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not
come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will
you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me
to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,
extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her
gait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o'clock in the
morning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my
story of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that
open's on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is
by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments
have not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her
niece's caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,
though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe
it!""Since you've gone so far, ma'am, I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by
your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"

"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor
Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has
passed.Re-enter at eight o'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own
eyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be
expected.All those to whom I am
going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
astonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or
fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of
Saint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,
the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss
de Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
in the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from
the sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of
their sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally
with the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,
alas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She
valued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the
delicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous
cluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
of SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady's character was extreme.Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
resolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish
that it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her
audacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well
as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and
blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose
piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who
entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either
placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met
in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she
resided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the
bath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne's dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker
who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,
or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
perfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived
for the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls
of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth
of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of
Adrienne's dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a
single large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of
ground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between
these two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with
furze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round
the ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet
damask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest
style, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended
over the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
decorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne's dressing
case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large
tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids
precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place
of a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the
farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
modesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet
of gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two
frosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting
of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles
of oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver
gilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich
divan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture
of this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the
sweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
before her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
attention and with a charming originality.We have already seen
Georgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing lady's maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
long golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
charming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
Venetian painters.Her slender waist curved
in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne's
women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so
pleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of
Hebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her
charming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The
physiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On
their features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing
and hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded
deference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the
zealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon
Adrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of
deference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from
the services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have
thought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her
person all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a
work of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they
were stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
window.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
than usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and
flexible as a bird's, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,
and all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the
comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots
of her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the
roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every
spot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,
could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now
they glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and
wit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep
a black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a
delightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those
of ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to
behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
like another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,
Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,
stood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her
small white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent
brightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves
of that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a
thousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all
directions.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays
from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's
forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they
adapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the
beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and
having upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied
herself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and
crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh
color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled
box, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling
hands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her
mistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe
the different operations of Adrienne's toilette with grave and reflective
attention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
a small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
and read aloud as follows:

"HONORED MADAME,

"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you
with respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,
with probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in
our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
of all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my
father, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and
their probity."She continued:

"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;
but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in
poverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted
from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin
came here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself
anew; "the secretary of Abbe d'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him
being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and
that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if
we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the
new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain
this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and
excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and
to relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to
acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much
as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill
it was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and
substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said
Adrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,
and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I
love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:

"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has
been our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like
honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,
honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who
are so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your
recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
a position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To
wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but
a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and
dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on
reading:

"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us
to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked
to think only of one's self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place
upon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were
conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still
remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,
and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He
is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he
appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a
little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
countrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of
an ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened
all my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of
the Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne's three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
interested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had
called him, continued to read Dupont's letter:

"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to
attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has
lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
greatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud
to proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by
the English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that
General Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his
service."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,
"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things
happen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in
truth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust
to me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only
necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of
countenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy
of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the
purchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian
vestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent
hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have
worn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful
hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is
not a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what
can either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome
young prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and
cashmere.Most assuredly I'll not miss this rare and unique opportunity
of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the
name--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is
this!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he
merits!"And then she read on:

"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give
him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer
a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so
unfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be
pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the
contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it
has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
sing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
recollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names
that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing
more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by
marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that
character.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are
not so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or
confound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid
European dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty
fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of
her women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The
young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials
for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I
await orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
all others:

"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,
with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,
sir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,
from the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and
correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will
choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all
things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you
will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere
shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
know so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another
quarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown
friend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is
necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will
add, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures
him to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you
will tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will
cause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he
finds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the
unknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,
modestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at
the opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though
this must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey
as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de
Babylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of
BABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Oriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to
be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
in this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is
because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
there is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly
resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient
days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to
my dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
princess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to
understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine
expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
generosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,
that I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress's
toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
order to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
happiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his
daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more
astonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so
sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one
another.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having
been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths
of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of
a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;
that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;
but that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent
by some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
surprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,
when I return to my mother after a day's toil, and often, even while
forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,
is, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass
of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest
claim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of
conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned
on very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will
become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to
regard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal
Simon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk
of being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety
for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for
the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor
will suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself
quite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in
the midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of
all, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"
said she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his
health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day
on which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly
at ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some
other means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for
the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever
be grateful."It is proper that those
who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who
have too little.Marshal Simon's daughters are members of my family, and
they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will
apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to
thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,
I shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
exclaiming:

"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said
Georgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,
as if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:
and now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and
are on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been
acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for
Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything
the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to
be voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But
in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and
escape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my
measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep
possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man
knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named
Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
importance.""That's my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a
trick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for
trick.added she, addressing herself to
Hebe."I answered, that I didn't know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my
aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is
rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
you will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come
in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
fears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves
you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget
them also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your
family.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
annoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will
come and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a
nobleman's left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,
"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of
concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all
searches.You will be very well
accommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the
place inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you
forget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you
have restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this
singular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are
entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother's, in
this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for
Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,
putting a paper into the duenna's hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o'clock.""But before nine o'clock she came home, after having passed the night out
of her house.Eight o'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do
not understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I
know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions.They don't distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
down all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew
the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I
have been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very
great mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are
free."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and
with tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who
placed me here.""In spite of one's self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so
confiding."But you are not here to sing her
praises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview
which she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of
what she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,
without Florine being able to hear her: "'They laugh most who laugh
last.'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would
tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I
advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.A pretty saint, and a pretty
dove, truly!She is round as a hogshead, with the voice of a town-crier;
has gray moustachios like an old grenadier, and without her knowing it, I
heard her say to her servant: 'Stir your stumps, my hearty!'--and yet she
calls herself Sainte-Colombe!""How hard on her you are, Dupont; a body don't choose one's name.And, if
she has a beard, it is not the lady's fault.""No--but it is her fault to call herself Sainte-Colombe.Ah, my poor Catherine, you are yet very green in some
things.""While you, my poor Dupont, are well read in slander!The first thing she asked for on arriving was the
chapel of the Castle, of which she had heard speak.She even said that
she would make some embellishments in it; and, when I told her we had no
church in this little place, she appeared quite vexed not to have a
curate in the village."that's the first thought of your upstarts--to play the
great lady of the parish, like your titled people.""Madame de la Sainte-Colombe need not play the great lady, because she is
one.""Yes--only see how she was dressed, in scarlet gown, and violet gloves
like a bishop's; and, when she took off her bonnet, she had a diamond
band round her head-dress of false, light hair, and diamond ear-drops as
large as my thumb, and diamond rings on every finger!None of your
tuppenny beauties would wear so many diamonds in the middle of the day.""Do you mean to say there's more?""She talked of nothing but dukes, and marquises, and counts, and very
rich gentlemen, who visit at her house, and are her most intimate
friends; and then, when she saw the summer house in the park, half-burnt
by the Prussians, which our late master never rebuilt, she asked, 'What
are those ruins there?'and I answered: 'Madame, it was in the time of
the Allies that the pavilion was burnt.'--'Oh, my clear,' cried she; 'our
allies, good, dear allies!So
you see, Dupont, I said to myself directly: 'She was no doubt one of the
noble women who fled abroad--'"

"Madame de la Sainte-Colombe!"cried the bailiff, laughing heartily."Oh,
my poor, poor wife!""Oh, it is all very well; but because you have been three years at Paris,
don't think yourself a conjurer!""Catherine, let's drop it: you will make me say some folly, and there are
certain things which dear, good creatures like you need never know.""I cannot tell what you are driving at, only try to be less
slanderous--for, after all, should Madame de la Sainte-Colombe buy the
estate, will you be sorry to remain as her bailiff, eh?""Not I--for we are getting old, my good Catherine; we have lived here
twenty years, and we have been too honest to provide for our old days by
pilfering--and truly, at our age, it would be hard to seek another place,
which perhaps we should not find.What I regret is, that Mademoiselle
Adrienne should not keep the land; it seems that she wished to sell it,
against the will of the princess."is it not very extraordinary that Mademoiselle
Adrienne should have the disposal of her large fortune so early in life?"Our young lady, having no father or mother, is
mistress of her property, besides having a famous little will of her own.Dost remember, ten years ago, when the count brought her down here one
summer?--what an imp of mischief!eh?--how they
sparkled, even then!""It is true that Mademoiselle Adrienne had in her look--an expression--a
very uncommon expression for her age.""If she has kept what her witching, luring face promised, she must be
very pretty by this time, notwithstanding the peculiar color of her
hair--for, between ourselves, if she had been a tradesman's daughter,
instead of a young lady of high birth, they would have called it red."Heaven forbid--I always thought
that she would be as good as pretty, and it is not speaking ill of her to
say she has red hair.On the contrary, it always appears to me so fine,
so bright, so sunny, and to suit so well her snowy complexion and black
eyes, that in truth I would not have had it other than it was; and I am
sure, that now this very color of her hair, which would be a blemish in
any one else, must only add to the charm of Mademoiselle Adrienne's face.She must have such a sweet vixen look!"to be candid, she really was a vixen--always running about the park,
aggravating her governess, climbing the trees--in fact, playing all
manner of naughty tricks.""I grant you, Mademoiselle Adrienne was a chip of the old block; but then
what wit, what engaging ways, and above all, what a good heart!"Once I remember she gave her shawl and her
new merino frock to a poor little beggar girl, and came back to the house
in her petticoat, and bare arms.""Oh, an excellent heart--but headstrong--terribly headstrong!""Yes--that she was; and 'tis likely to finish badly, for it seems that
she does things at Paris--oh!such things--"

"What things?""Oh, my dear; I can hardly venture--"

"Fell, but what are they?""Why," said the worthy dame, with a sort of embarrassment and confusion,
which showed how much she was shocked by such enormities, "they say, that
Mademoiselle Adrienne never sets foot in a church, but lives in a kind of
heathen temple in her aunt's garden, where she has masked women to dress
her up like a goddess, and scratches them very often, because she gets
tipsy--without mentioning, that every night she plays on a hunting horn
of massive gold--all which causes the utmost grief and despair to her
poor aunt the princess."Here the bailiff burst into a fit of laughter, which interrupted his
wife."Now tell me," said he, when this first access of hilarity was over,
"where did you get these fine stories about Mademoiselle Adrienne?""From Rene's wife, who went to Paris to look for a child to nurse; she
called at Saint-Dizier House, to see Madame Grivois, her godmother.--Now
Madame Grivois is first bedchamber woman to the princess--and she it was
who told her all this--and surely she ought to know, being in the house.""Yes, a fine piece of goods that Grivois!once she was a regular bad 'un,
but now she professes to be as over-nice as her mistress; like master
like man, they say.The princess herself, who is now so stiff and
starched, knew how to carry on a lively game in her time.Fifteen years
ago, she was no such prude: do you remember that handsome colonel of
hussars, who was in garrison at Abbeville?an exiled noble who had served
in Russia, whom the Bourbons gave a regiment on the Restoration?""Yes, yes--I remember him; but you are really too backbiting.""Not a bit--I only speak the truth.The colonel spent his whole time
here, and every one said he was very warm with this same princess, who is
now such a saint.Every evening, some new
entertainment at the chateau.What a fellow that colonel was, to set
things going; how well he could act a play!--I remember--"

The bailiff was unable to proceed.A stout maid-servant, wearing the
costume and cap of Picardy, entered in haste, and thus addressed her
mistress: "Madame, there is a person here that wants to speak to master;
he has come in the postmaster's calash from Saint-Valery, and he says
that he is M.A moment after, M. Rodin made his appearance.According to his custom, he
was dressed even more than plainly.With an air of great humility, he
saluted the bailiff and his wife, and at a sign from her husband, the
latter withdrew.The cadaverous countenance of M. Rodin, his almost
invisible lips, his little reptile eyes, half concealed by their flabby
lids, and the sordid style of his dress, rendered his general aspect far
from prepossessing; yet this man knew how, when it was necessary, to
affect, with diabolical art, so much sincerity and good-nature--his words
were so affectionate and subtly penetrating--that the disagreeable
feeling of repugnance, which the first sight of him generally inspired,
wore off little by little, and he almost always finished by involving his
dupe or victim in the tortuous windings of an eloquence as pliant as it
was honeyed and perfidious; for ugliness and evil have their fascination,
as well as what is good and fair.The honest bailiff looked at this man with surprise, when he thought of
the pressing recommendation of the steward of the Princess de Saint
Dizier; he had expected to see quite another sort of personage, and,
hardly able to dissemble his astonishment, he said to him: "Is it to M.
Rodin that I have the honor to speak?""Yes, sir; and here is another letter from the steward of the Princess de
Saint-Dizier.""Pray, sir, draw near the fire, whilst I just see what is in this letter.The weather is so bad," continued the bailiff, obligingly, "may I not
offer you some refreshment?""A thousand thanks, my dear sir; I am off again in an hour."Whilst M. Dupont read, M. Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the
chamber; like a man of skill and experience, he had frequently drawn just
and useful inductions from those little appearances, which, revealing a
taste or habit, give at the same time some notion of a character; on this
occasion, however, his curiosity was at fault."Very good, sir," said the bailiff, when he had finished reading; "the
steward renews his recommendation, and tells me to attend implicitly to
your commands.""Well, sir, they will amount to very little, and I shall not trouble you
long.""It will be no trouble, but an honor.""Nay, I know how much your time must be occupied, for, as soon as one
enters this chateau, one is struck with the good order and perfect
keeping of everything in it--which proves, my dear sir, what excellent
care you take of it.""Oh, sir, you flatter me.""Flatter you?--a poor old man like myself has something else to think of.But to come to business: there is a room here which is called the Green
Chamber?""Yes, sir; the room which the late Count-Duke de Cardoville used for a
study.""You will have the goodness to take me there.""Unfortunately, it is not in my power to do so.After the death of the
Count-Duke, and when the seals were removed, a number of papers were shut
up in a cabinet in that room, and the lawyers took the keys with them to
Paris.""Here are those keys," said M. Rodin, showing to the bailiff a large and
a small key tied together."Yes--for certain papers--and also far a small mahogany casket, with
silver clasps--do you happen to know it?""Yes, sir; I have often seen it on the count's writing-table.It must be
in the large, lacquered cabinet, of which you have the key.""You will conduct me to this chamber, as authorized by the Princess de
Saint-Dizier?""Yes, sir; the princess continues in good health?""And Mademoiselle Adrienne?"said M. Rodin, with a sigh of deep contrition and
grief.has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle Adrienne?""No, no--she is, unfortunately, as well as she is beautiful."for when beauty, youth, and health are joined to an evil
spirit of revolt and perversity--to a character which certainly has not
its equal upon earth--it would be far better to be deprived of those
dangerous advantages, which only become so many causes of perdition.But
I conjure you, my dear sir, let us talk of something else: this subject
is too painful," said M. Rodin, with a voice of deep emotion, lifting the
tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as if to stop a
rising tear.The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was
struck with the change in M. Rodin's voice.He answered him, therefore,
with much sympathy: "Pardon my indiscretion, sir; I really did not
know--"

"It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of
feeling--tears are so rare with old men--but if you had seen, as I have,
the despair of that excellent princess, whose only fault has been too
much kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece--by which she
has encouraged her--but, once more, let us talk of something else, my
dear sir!"After a moment's pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from his
emotion, he said to Dupont: "One part of my mission, my dear sir--that
which relates to the Green Chamber--I have now told you; but there is yet
another.Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a
circumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or
sixteen years ago, the Marquis d'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in
garrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house."It was only just now, that I
was talking about him to my wife.He was the life of the house!--how well
he could perform plays--particularly the character of a scapegrace.In
the Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with laughing, in
that part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he
sang Joconde, sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!"Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: "You
doubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious
Bonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d'Aigrigny (whose private
secretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church.""That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and
flattered--abandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and,
notwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation as a
great preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain
abbe--whilst so many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are
archbishops and cardinals."M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of
conviction, and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that
M. Dupont could not help exclaiming: "Well, sir, that is splendid
conduct!"said M. Rodin, with an inimitable expression of
simplicity; "it is quite a matter of course when one has a heart like M.
d'Aigrigny's.But amongst all his good qualities, he has particularly
that of never forgetting worthy people--people of integrity, honor,
conscience--and therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he has not forgotten you.""What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember--"

"Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions your
name.""He will be there soon, if not there now.He went to Italy about three
months ago, and, during his absence, he received a very sad piece of
news--the death of his mother, who was passing the autumn on one of the
estates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier.""Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves to
the will of Providence!""And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to
mention my name?"First of all, you must know that this house is
sold.The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from
Paris.""I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as their
bailiff."It is just on that subject that I am going
to speak to you."Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you, I am
particularly desirous that you should keep this place, and I will do all
in my power to serve you, if--"

"Ah, sir!"cried Dupont, interrupting Rodin; "what gratitude do I not owe
you!"Now, my dear sir, you flatter me in your turn; but I ought to tell you,
that I'm obliged to annex a small condition to my support.""The person who is about to inhabit this mansion, is an old lady in every
way worthy of veneration; Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is the name of this
respectable--"

"What, sir?"said the bailiff, interrupting Rodin; "Madame de la Sainte
Colombe the lady who has bought us out?""Yes, sir, she came last week to see the estate.My wife persists that
she is a great lady; but--between ourselves--judging by certain words
that I heard her speak--"

"You are full of penetration, my dear M. Dupont.Madame de la Sainte
Colombe is far from being a great lady.I believe she was neither more
nor less than a milliner, under one of the wooden porticoes of the Palais
Royal.You see, that I deal openly with you.""And she boasted of all the noblemen, French and foreign, who used to
visit her!""No doubt, they came to buy bonnets for their wives!However, the fact
is, that, having gained a large fortune and, after being in youth and
middle age--indifferent--alas!more than indifferent to the salvation of
her soul--Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is now in a likely way to
experience grace--which renders her, as I told you, worthy of veneration,
because nothing is so respectable as a sincere repentance--always
providing it to be lasting.Now to make the good work sure and effectual,
we shall need your assistance, my dear M."A great deal; and I will explain to you how.There is no church in this
village, which stands at an equal distance from either of two parishes.Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make choice of one of the two
clergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have long
lived in these parts, for information respecting them."in that case the choice will soon be made.The incumbent of
Danicourt is one of the best of men.""Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte
Colombe.""You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate of
Roiville, the other parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust
herself to his care.""And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?""Why?--because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de
la Sainte-Colombe to make the choice I wish, you will be certain to keep
your place as bailiff.I give you my word of it, and what I promise I
perform.""I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power," said Dupont, convinced
by Rodin's manner, and the authority of his words; "but I should like to
know--"

"One word more," said Rodin, interrupting him; "I will deal openly with
you, and tell you why I insist on the preference which I beg you to
support.I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow of an
intrigue.It is only for the purpose of doing a good action.The curate
of Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M.
d'Aigrigny feels a deep interest.Though very poor, he has to support an
aged mother.Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe, he would do more good than any one else, because he is full of
zeal and patience; and then it is clear he would reap some little
advantages, by which his old mother might profit--there you see is the
secret of this mighty scheme.When I knew that this lady was disposed to
buy an estate in the neighborhood of our friend's parish, I wrote about
it to the marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to
render him this small service, which, as you see, will not remain without
a recompense.For I tell you once more, and I will prove it, that I have
the power to keep you in your place as bailiff.""Well, sir," replied Dupont, after a moment's reflection, "you are so
frank and obliging, that I will imitate your sincerity.In the same
degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected and loved in this
country, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to prefer to him, is
dreaded for his intolerance--and, moreover--"

"Well, and what more?""Why, then, they say--"

"Come, what do they say?"Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff
was quite struck dumb with amazement--for the countenance of M. Rodin
took a singular expression when he laughed.he repeated, with
redoubled hilarity; "a Jesuit!--Now really, my dear M. Dupont, for a man
of sense, experience, and intelligence, how can you believe such idle
stories?--A Jesuit--are there such people as Jesuits?--in our time, above
all, can you believe such romance of the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old
freedom lovers?--Come, come; I wager, you have read about them in the
Constitutionnel!""And yet, sir, they say--"

"Good heavens!what will they not say?--But wise men, prudent men like
you, do not meddle with what is said--they manage their own little
matters, without doing injury to any one, and they never sacrifice, for
the sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable
provision for the rest of their days.I tell you frankly, however much I
may regret it, that should you not succeed in getting the preference for
my man, you will not remain bailiff here."But, sir," said poor Dupont, "it will not be my fault, if this lady,
hearing a great deal in praise of the other curate, should prefer him to
your friend."but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the
neighborhood--persons worthy of confidence, whom she will see every
day--tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of good of my friend,
and a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the former,
and you will continue bailiff.""But, sir--that would be calumny!"said Rodin, with an air of sorrowful and
affectionate reproach, "how can you think me capable of giving you evil
counsel?--I was only making a supposition.You wish to remain bailiff on
this estate.I offer you the certainty of doing so--it is for you to
consider and decide.""But, sir--"

"One word more--or rather one more condition--as important as the other.Unfortunately, we have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and
weakness of their penitents, unfairly to benefit either themselves or
others: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness--but, in
order to discharge my responsibility--and yours also, as you will have
contributed to his appointment--I must request that you will write to me
twice a week, giving the most exact detail of all that you have remarked
in the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe--for the influence of a confessor, you see, reveals itself in the
whole conduct of life, and I should wish to be fully edified by the
proceedings of my friend, without his being aware of it--or, if anything
blameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed of it by
this weekly correspondence.""But, sir--that would be to act as a spy?""Now, my dear M. Dupont!how can you thus brand the sweetest, most
wholesome of human desires--mutual confidence?--I ask of you nothing
else--I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details of all that
goes on here.On these two conditions, inseparable one from the other,
you remain bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief and regret,
to recommend some one else to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe.""I beg you, sir," said Dupont, with emotion, "Be generous without any
conditions!--I and my wife have only this place to give us bread, and we
are too old to find another.Do not expose our probity of forty years'
standing to be tempted by the fear of want, which is so bad a
counsellor!""My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect upon
this, and give me your answer in the course of a week."I implore you--" The conversation was here interrupted by a
loud report, which was almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of
the cliffs.Hardly had he spoken, when the
same noise was again heard more distinctly than before."It is the sound of cannon," cried Dupont, rising; "no doubt a ship in
distress, or signaling for a pilot.""My dear," said the bailiffs wife, entering abruptly, "from the terrace,
we can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismasted--they are drifting
right upon the shore--the ship is firing minute gulls--it will be lost."cried the bailiff, taking his hat and preparing to
go out, "to look on at a shipwreck, and be able to do nothing!""Can no help be given to these vessels?""If they are driven upon the reefs, no human power can save them; since
the last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast.""Lost with all on board?--Oh, very frightful," said M. Rodin."In such a storm, there is but little chance for the crew; no matter,"
said the bailiff, addressing his wife, "I will run down to the rocks with
the people of the farm, and try to save some of them, poor
creatures!--Light large fires in several rooms--get ready linen, clothes,
cordials--I scarcely dare hope to save any, but we must do our best."I should think it a duty, if I could be at all useful, but I am too old
and feeble to be of any service," said M. Rodin, who was by no means
anxious to encounter the storm."Your good lady will be kind enough to
show me the Green Chamber, and when I have found the articles I require,
I will set out immediately for Paris, for I am in great haste."Ring the big bell," said the
bailiff to his servant; "let all the people of the farm meet me at the
foot of the cliff, with ropes and levers.""Yes, my dear," replied Catherine; "but do not expose yourself.""Kiss me--it will bring me luck," said the bailiff; and he started at a
full run, crying: "Quick!quick; by this time not a plank may remain of
the vessels.""My dear madam," said Rodin, always impassible, "will you be obliging
enough to show me the Green Chamber?""Please to follow me, sir," answered Catherine, drying her tears--for she
trembled on account of her husband, whose courage she well knew.THE TEMPEST

The sea is raging.Mountainous waves of dark green, marbled with white
foam, stand out, in high, deep undulations, from the broad streak of red
light, which extends along the horizon.Above are piled heavy masses of
black and sulphurous vapor, whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish
gray, driven by the violence of the wind, rush across the murky sky.The pale winter sun, before he quite disappears in the great clouds,
behind which he is slowly mounting, casts here and there some oblique
rays upon the troubled sea, and gilds the transparent crest of some of
the tallest waves.A band of snow-white foam boils and rages as far as
the eye can reach, along the line of the reefs that bristle on this
dangerous coast.Half-way up a rugged promontory, which juts pretty far into the sea,
rises Cardoville Castle; a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows; its
brick walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this
sky loaded with vapors.A large, disabled ship, with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from
the stumps of broken masts, drives dead upon the coast.Now she rolls her
monstrous hull upon the waves--now plunges into their trough.A flash is
seen, followed by a dull sound, scarcely perceptible in the midst of the
roar of the tempest.That gun is the last signal of distress from this
lost vessel, which is fast forging on the breakers.At the same moment, a steamer, with its long plume of black smoke, is
working her way from east to west, making every effort to keep at a
distance from the shore, leaving the breakers on her left.The dismasted
ship, drifting towards the rocks, at the mercy of the wind and tide, must
some time pass right ahead of the steamer.Suddenly, the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side; the
enormous wave broke furiously on her deck; in a second the chimney was
carried away, the paddle box stove in, one of the wheels rendered
useless.A second white-cap, following the first, again struck the vessel
amidships, and so increased the damage that, no longer answering to the
helm, she also drifted towards the shore, in the same direction as the
ship.But the latter, though further from the breakers, presented a
greater surface to the wind and sea, and so gained upon the steamer in
swiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminent--a new
clanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck.The ship was an English vessel, the "Black Eagle," homeward bound from
Alexandria, with passengers, who arriving from India and Java, via the
Red Sea, had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez, from on board the
steamship "Ruyter."The "Black Eagle," quitting the Straits of Gibraltar,
had gone to touch at the Azores.She headed thence for Portsmouth, when
she was overtaken in the Channel by the northwester.The steamer was the
"William Tell," coming from Germany, by way of the Elbe, and bound, in
the last place, for Hamburg to Havre.These two vessels, the sport of enormous rollers, driven along by tide
and tempest, were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed.The
deck of each offered a terrible spectacle; the loss of crew and
passengers appeared almost certain, for before them a tremendous sea
broke on jagged rocks, at the foot of a perpendicular cliff.The captain of the "Black Eagle," standing on the poop, holding by the
remnant of a spar, issued his last orders in this fearful extremity with
courageous coolness.The smaller boats had been carried away by the
waves; it was in vain to think of launching the long-boat; the only
chance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to
pieces on touching the rocks, was to establish a communication with the
land by means of a life-line--almost the last resort for passing between
the shore and a stranded vessel.The deck was covered with passengers, whose cries and terror augmented
the general confusion.Some, struck with a kind of stupor, and clinging
convulsively to the shrouds, awaited their doom in a state of stupid
insensibility.Others wrung their hands in despair, or rolled upon the
deck uttering horrible imprecations.Here, women knelt down to pray;
there, others hid their faces in their hands, that they might not see the
awful approach of death.A young mother, pale as a specter, holding her
child clasped tightly to her bosom, went supplicating from sailor to
sailor, and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that
would take charge of her son.These cries, and tears, and terror contrasted with the stern and silent
resignation of the sailors.Knowing the imminence of the inevitable
danger, some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes,
waiting for the moment to make a last effort, to dispute their lives with
the fury of the waves; others renouncing all hope, prepared to meet death
with stoical indifference.Here and there, touching or awful episodes rose in relief, if one may so
express it, from this dark and gloomy background of despair.A young man of about eighteen or twenty, with shiny black hair, copper
<DW52> complexion, and perfectly regular and handsome features,
contemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness
peculiar to those who have often braved great perils; wrapped in a cloak,
he leaned his back against the bulwarks, with his feet resting against
one of the bulkheads.Suddenly, the unhappy mother, who, with her child
in her arms, and gold in her hand, had in vain addressed herself to
several of the mariners, to beg them to save her boy, perceiving the
young man with the copper-<DW52> complexion, threw herself on her knees
before him, and lifted her child towards him with a burst of
inexpressible agony.The young man took it, mournfully shook his head,
and pointed to the furious waves--but, with a meaning gesture, he
appeared to promise that he would at least try to save it.Then the young
mother, in a mad transport of hope, seized the hand of the youth, and
bathed it with her tears.Further on, another passenger of the "Black Eagle," seemed animated by
sentiments of the most active pity.One would hardly have given him
five-and-twenty years of age.His long, fair locks fell in curls on
either side of his angelic countenance.He wore a black cassock and white
neck-band.Applying himself to comfort the most desponding, he went from
one to the other, and spoke to them pious words of hope and resignation;
to hear him console some, and encourage others, in language full of
unction, tenderness, and ineffable charity, one would have supposed him
unaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared.On his fine, mild features, was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity,
a religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought; from time to
time, he raised to heaven his large blue eyes, beaming with gratitude,
love, and serenity, as if to thank God for having called him to one of
those formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may
devote himself for his brethren, and, if not able to rescue them at all,
at least die with them, pointing to the sky.One might almost have taken
him for an angel, sent down to render less cruel the strokes of
inexorable fate.not far from this young man's angelic beauty, there was
another being, who resembled an evil spirit!Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit, to which he held on by
means of some remaining cordage, this man looked down upon the terrible
scene that was passing on the deck.A grim, wild joy lighted up his
countenance of a dead yellow, that tint peculiar to those who spring from
the union of the white race with the East.He wore only a shirt and linen
drawers; from his neck was suspended, by a cord, a cylindrical tin box,
similar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence.The more the danger augmented, the nearer the ship came to the breakers,
or to a collision with the steamer, which she was now rapidly
approaching--a terrible collision, which would probably cause the two
vessels to founder before even they touched the rocks--the more did the
infernal joy of this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports.He
seemed to long, with ferocious impatience, for the moment when the work
of destruction should be accomplished.To see him thus feasting with
avidity on all the agony, the terror, and the despair of those around
him, one might have taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary
deities, who, in barbarous countries, preside over murder and carnage.By this time the "Black Eagle," driven by the wind and waves, came so
near the "William Tell" that the passengers on the deck of the nearly
dismantled steamer were visible from the first-named vessel.The heavy sea, which stove in
the paddle-box and broke one of the paddles, had also carried away nearly
the whole of the bulwarks on that side; the waves, entering every instant
by this large opening, swept the decks with irresistible violence, and
every time bore away with them some fresh victims.Amongst the passengers, who seemed only to have escaped this danger to be
hurled against the rocks, or crushed in the encounter of the two vessels,
one group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful interest.Taking refuge abaft, a tall old man, with bald forehead and gray
moustache, had lashed himself to a stanchion, by winding a piece of rope
round his body, whilst he clasped in his arms, and held fast to his
breast, two girls of fifteen or sixteen, half enveloped in a pelisse of
reindeer-skin.A large, fallow, Siberian dog, dripping with water, and
barking furiously at the waves, stood close to their feet.These girls, clasped in the arms of the old man, also pressed close to
each other; but, far from being lost in terror, they raised their eyes to
heaven, full of confidence and ingenuous hope, as though they expected to
be saved by the intervention of some supernatural power.A frightful shriek of horror and despair, raised by the passengers of
both vessels, was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest.At the
moment when, plunging deeply between two waves, the broadside of the
steamer was turned towards the bows of the ship, the latter, lifted to a
prodigious height on a mountain of water, remained, as it were, suspended
over the "William Tell," during the second which preceded the shock of
the two vessels.There are sights of so sublime a horror, that it is impossible to
describe them.Yet, in the midst of these catastrophes, swift as thought,
one catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture, rapid and
fleeting, as if illumined by a flash of lightning.Thus, when the "Black Eagle," poised aloft by the flood, was about to
crash down upon the "William Tell," the young man with the angelic
countenance and fair, waving locks bent over the prow of the ship, ready
to cast himself into the sea to save some victim.Suddenly, he perceived
on board the steamer, on which he looked down from the summit of the
immense wave, the two girls extending their arms towards him in
supplication.They appeared to recognize him, and gazed on him with a
sort of ecstacy and religious homage!For a second, in spite of the horrors of the tempest, in spite of the
approaching shipwreck, the looks of those three beings met.The features
of the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity; for the
maidens with their hands clasped in prayer, seemed to invoke him as their
expected Saviour.The old man, struck down by the fall of a plank, lay
helpless on the deck.A fearful mass of water dashed the "Black Eagle" down upon the "William
Tell," in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam.To the dreadful crash of
the two great bodies of wood and iron, which splintering against one
another, instantly foundered, one loud cry was added--a cry of agony and
death--the cry of a hundred human creatures swallowed up at once by the
waves!A few moments after, the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the
trough of the sea, and on the caps of the waves--with here and there the
contracted arms, the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy wretches,
striving to make their way to the reefs along the shore, at the risk of
being crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers.While the bailiff was gone to the sea-shore, to render help to those of
the passengers who might escape from the inevitable shipwreck, M. Rodin,
conducted by Catherine to the Green Chamber, had there found the articles
that he was to take with him to Paris.After passing two hours in this apartment, very indifferent to the fate
of the shipwrecked persons, which alone absorbed the attention of the
inhabitants of the Castle, Rodin returned to the chamber commonly
occupied by the bailiff, a room which opened upon a long gallery.When he
entered it he found nobody there.Under his arm he held a casket, with
silver fastenings, almost black from age, whilst one end of a large red
morocco portfolio projected from the breast-pocket of his half buttoned
great coat.Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe d'Aigrigny's secretary
been able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile, his
features would have been radiant with delight; for, just then, he was
under the influence of the most agreeable thoughts.Having placed the
casket upon a table, it was with marked satisfaction that he thus
communed with himself:

"All goes well.It was prudent to keep these papers here till this
moment, for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of
that Adrienne de Cardoville, who appears to guess instinctively what it
is impossible she should know.Fortunately, the time approaches when we
shall have no more need to fear her.Her fate will be a cruel one; it
must be so.Those proud, independent characters are at all times our
natural enemies--they are so by their very essence--how much more when
they show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous!As for La Sainte
Colombe, the bailiff is sure to act for us; between what the fool calls
his conscience, and the dread of being at his age deprived of a
livelihood, he will not hesitate.I wish to have him because he will
serve us better than a stranger; his having been here twenty years will
prevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrow-minded woman.Once in the hands of our man at Roiville, I will answer for the result.The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand: in
their youth, they serve the devil; in riper years, they make others serve
him; in their old age, they are horribly afraid of him; and this fear
must continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville, which, from
its isolated position, will make us an excellent college.As for the affair of the medals, the 13th of February approaches,
without news from Joshua--evidently, Prince Djalma is still kept prisoner
by the English in the heart of India, or I must have received letters
from Batavia.The daughters of General Simon will be detained at Leipsic
for at least a month longer.All our foreign relations are in the best
condition.As for our internal affairs--"

 Here M. Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the
entrance of Madame Dupont, who was zealously engaged in preparations to
give assistance in case of need."Now," said she to the servant, "light a fire in the next room; put this
warm wine there; your master may be in every minute.""Well, my dear madam," said Rodin to her, "do they hope to save any of
these poor creatures?"He is so courageous, so imprudent, if
once he thinks he can be of any service.""Courageous even to imprudence," said Rodin to himself, impatiently; "I
do not like that.""Well," resumed Catherine, "I have here at hand my hot linen, my
cordials--heaven grant it may all be of use!""We may at least hope so, my dear madam.I very much regretted that my
age and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband.I
also regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions, and to
wish him joy if successful--for I am unfortunately compelled to depart,
my moments are precious.I shall be much obliged if you will have the
carriage got ready.""Yes, Sir; I will see about it directly.""One word, my dear, good Madame Dupont.You are a woman of sense, and
excellent judgment.Now I have put your husband in the way to keep, if he
will, his situation as bailiff of the estate--"

"Is it possible?Without this place
what would become of us at our time of life?""I have only saddled my promise with two conditions--mere trifles--he
will explain all that to you."we shall regard you as our deliverer."Only, on two little conditions--"

"If there were a hundred, sir we should gladly accept them.Think what we
should be without this place--penniless--absolutely penniless!""I reckon upon you then; for the interest of your husband, you will try
to persuade him."here's master come back," cried a servant,
rushing into the chamber."No, missus; he is alone."A few moments after, M. Dupont entered the room; his clothes were
streaming with water; to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm, he
had tied it down to his head by means of his cravat, which was knotted
under his chin; his gaiters were covered with chalky stains."There I have thee, my dear love!"cried his wife, tenderly embracing
him."Up to the present moment--THREE SAVED."said Rodin; "at least your efforts
will not have been all in vain.""I only speak of those I saw myself, near the little creek of Goelands.Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast.""Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts.""And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?"asked Rodin,
who could not avoid remaining a few instants longer."They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people.As they cannot
walk very fast, I ran on before to console my wife, and to take the
necessary measures for their reception.First of all, my dear, you must
get ready some women's clothes.""There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?""There are two girls--fifteen or sixteen years of age at the most--mere
children--and so pretty!"said Rodin, with an affectation of interest."The person to whom they owe their lives is with them."Yes; only fancy--"

"You can tell me all this by and by.Just slip on this dry warm
dressing-gown, and take some of this hot wine."I'll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death.I was telling you that
the person who saved these young girls was a hero; and certainly his
courage was beyond anything one could have imagined.When I left here
with the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path, and
arrived at the foot of the cliff--near the little creek of Goelands,
fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous
masses of rock stretching out into the sea.Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their feet
still in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as though
they had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from the
sea."said M. Rodin, raising, as usual,
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as though to
dry a tear, which was very seldom visible."What struck me was their great resemblance to each other," resumed the
bailiff; "only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the
difference.""Twin--sisters, no doubt," said Madame Dupont."One of the poor things," continued the bailiff, "held between her
clasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from her neck by
a chain of the same material."Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last
words of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color
spread itself over his livid cheeks.In any other person, these symptoms
would have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for
long years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no
ordinary excitement.Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a
slightly agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: "It was
doubtless a pious relic.Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?""No, sir; I did not think of it.""And the two young girls were like one another--very much like, you say?""So like, that one would hardly know which was which.Probably they are
orphans, for they are dressed in mourning."said M. Rodin, with another start."As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place where
the sand was quite dry.While we were busy about this, we saw the head of
a man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to climb,
clinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick of
time, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of our
men.It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content with
having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had
attempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst
the rocks and breakers--but his strength failed him, and, without the aid
of our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to
which he clung."Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to
this conversation.The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,
only increased upon reflection.The two girls, who had just been saved,
were fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that
one might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain
with a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters
of General Simon.But how could those sisters be amongst the number of
shipwrecked passengers?How could they have escaped from the prison at
Leipsic?How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it?Could
they have fled, or had they been set at liberty?How was it possible that
he should not be apprise of such an event?But these secondary thoughts,
which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were
swallowed up in the one fact: "the daughters of General Simon are
here!"--His plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed."When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls," resumed the
bailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin's absence of
mind, "you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?--well, he is
altogether the reverse.He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet
face, and light, curling locks.I left him a cloak to cover him, for he
had nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black
worsted stockings--which struck me as singular.""Why, it was certainly not a sailor's dress.""Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a Frenchman,
for he speaks our language as well as we do.What brought the tears to my
eyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to themselves.As soon
as they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet, and seemed to look up
to him and thank him, as one would pray.Then they cast their eyes around
them, as if in search of some other person, and, having exchanged a few
words, they fell sobbing into each other's arms."How many poor creatures must have
perished!""When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven dead
bodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages.I spoke to some of
the coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and if, as
I hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought here.But surely that is the sound of voices!--yes, it is our shipwrecked
guests!"The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room--that door, which
opened on the long gallery--whilst Rodin, biting convulsively his flat
nails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers.A
touching picture soon presented itself to his view.From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by
several windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly.This group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to
whom they owed their lives.Rose and Blanche were on either side of their
deliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly
on their arms.Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of
this man made him appear younger.His long, fair hair, parted on the
forehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,
with which he had been covered.It would be difficult to describe the
adorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the
most ideal creations of Raphael's pencil--for that divine artist alone
could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite features, the
serenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue as those of an
archangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous
head.just above his light eyebrows, and rendered
still more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a
wound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair
forehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!)his hands had been
cruelly pierced by a crucifixion--his feet had suffered the same
injury--and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that his
wounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,
the adopted son of Dagobert's wife.He was a priest and martyr--for, in
our days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars flung
the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.Yes, in our days, the children of the people--for it is almost always
amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be
found--the children of the people, led by an honorable conviction,
because it is courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to
try and propagate their faith, and brave both torture and death with the
most unpretending valor.How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure
and unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!--And for
these humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith and
their intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they
seldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church.Never
does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated
limbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.[8]

In their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as
they recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able
to ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of
sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain
death.The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces
were deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears
were on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both
from agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that
they should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was
to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to
climb the rocks.Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the
soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on
one side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a
nature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
such imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of
General Simon's daughters, was a little softened.It must not be
forgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of
February, was essential to the success of Rodin's projects.The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,
approached them with eagerness.Just then a farm-boy entered the room,
crying: "Sir!good news--two more saved from the wreck!""Blessing and praise to God for it!"asked the bailiff, hastening towards the door."There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin; the
other was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a
litter made of branches.""I will run and have him placed in the room below," said the bailiff, as
he went out."Catherine, you can look to the young ladies.""And the shipwrecked man who can walk--where is he?""Here he is," said the peasant, pointing to some one who came rapidly
along the gallery; "when he heard that the two young ladies were safe in
the chateau--though he is old, and wounded in the head, he took such
great strides, that it was all I could do to get here before him."Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,
springing up by a common impulse, flew to the door.They arrived there at
the same moment as Dagobert.The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the
threshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while
Spoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the
orphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down
altogether, but for the care of the peasants.In spite of the
observations of the bailiff's wife, on their state of weakness and
agitation, the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was
carried fainting into an adjoining apartment.At sight of the soldier, Rodin's face was again violently contracted, for
he had till then believed that the guide of General Simon's daughters was
dead.The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning upon a chair,
and had not yet perceived Rodin.A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the
room, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him.This man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,
approached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign
accent: "Prince Djalma has just been brought in here.His first word was
to ask for you."cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder; for, at the
name of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel's side.exclaimed the missionary, falling back in surprise."M. Rodin," cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that moment, he
kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air of
deference, not unmixed with fear.repeated Rodin, in an excited tone."Did
he not utter the name of Prince Djalma?""Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English
ship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been wrecked.This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship that
brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and
being likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I
embarked on board the 'Black Eagle,' where I met Prince Djalma.We were
bound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to proceed to
France."This new shock had completely
paralyzed his thoughts.At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,
which he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: "Can you tell
me who this Prince Djalma is?""A young man as good as brave--the son of an East Indian king,
dispossessed of his territory by the English."Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to
him with anxious interest: "How is the Prince?"They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal," answered the
other.said the missionary, addressing Rodin; "here, you
see, is another saved.""So much the better," observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious tone."I will go see him," said Gabriel, submissively."You have no orders to
give me?""Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,
notwithstanding your fatigue?"Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair,
while the missionary went out with the peasant.The man with the sallow
complexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the
Stranglers.Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of
Tchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the
despatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter
by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the
"Ruyter."When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi, he had not
been seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on shipboard, after
his escape (which we shall explain by and by), not knowing that he
belonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the voyage as a
fellow-countryman.Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,
biting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half
caste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
shoulder, said to him: "Your name is Rodin?"asked the other, starting, and raising his head abruptly."You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?"But, once more, what do you want?""Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!"And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had
passed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed
before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.[8] We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or
three years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son
of poor parents in Beauce.He was writing to his mother from the heart of
Japan, and thus concluded his letter: "Adieu, my dear mother!they say
there is much danger where I am now sent to.Pray for me, and tell all
our good neighbors that I think of them very often."These few words,
addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of France,
are only the more touching from their very simplicity--E. S.




CHAPTER XXVI.The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House.The tempest
has lulled by degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse
murmur of the waves, as they wash heavily the shore.Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
apartments on the first-floor of the chateau.Djalma, too severely hurt
to be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below.At the moment of
the shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms.He had
failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
death, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when
thrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces.Faringhea, who has
been able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the
chamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be
ready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried
his clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,
placed in front of a bright coal-fire.His apartment is situated near
those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has
quitted the door of Rose and Blanche's chamber, to lie down and warm
himself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a
feeling of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and
sea.We will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old
Jovial; unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his
irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with,
ever since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was
the most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters
entered timidly.Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed
themselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert;
though the bailiff's wife, after showing them to their room, had returned
again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the
hurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to
the chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was
sleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing
their canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert
reposing there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe.To their great
astonishment, they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion,
not daring to advance or recede, for fear of waking him.The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled
naturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion
was the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of
the damask covering of the arm-chair.His beautiful countenance expressed
a profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful
dream, or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some
sad regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was
sleeping.Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features
preserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with
an inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering
goodness.The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed
simultaneously, and exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each
other the slumbering missionary."He sleeps, sister," said Rose in a low voice."So much the better," replied Blanche, also in a whisper, making a sign
of caution; "we shall now be able to observe him well.""Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.""He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.""But here, at least, he is visible.""Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.""And so--he has again rescued us.""Without him, we should have perished this morning.""And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance
shone with light.""Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.""And then he had not so sad a mien.""That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.""But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?""If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?"If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or in
helping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?"If he did not run any danger for those he protects, it
would be less noble.""What a pity that he does not open his eye!""Their expression is so good, so tender!""Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?""We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.""If we were to pray to him to speak to us?"The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a
bright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently
beneath their black dresses.said Blanche, believing rightly, that
Rose felt exactly as she did."And yet it seems to do us good.It is as
if some happiness were going to befall us."The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with
clasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young
priest.Turning their lovely faces towards
him, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to
their youthful appearance: "Gabriel!On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,
and, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,
beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle
voices repeat his name.said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.It was now Gabriel's turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he
had saved.said he to them; "you should kneel only
unto God."The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the
hand."You know my name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile."Yes--when you came from our mother."said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of
the orphans.I saw you to-day for the first time.""Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams.""In Germany--three months ago, for the first time.Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who
expected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more
perplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?""Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.""And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we
remembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.""Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that
dark night, when we were not able to see you?""What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our
old friend?""We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he
would not believe in angels.""And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.""This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your
assistance.I was coming from America, but I have never been in Leipsic.I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison.Tell me, my sisters,"
added he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?""For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother
from heaven to protect us.""My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest.It is by mere chance, no
doubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
dreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner--for angels are
not visible to mortal eye.said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each
other."No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by
the hand; "dreams, like everything else, come from above.Since the
remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream, it is twice
blessed."At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance.Up to
this time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert's wife had
adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a
priest and missionary.The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
blank wound (to use a term of General Simon's), had allowed it to be
carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black
bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the
natural grimness of his features.On entering the room, he was not a
little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
familiarly in his own.This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not
know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had
attempted to save his also.In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving
to cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very
imperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain
death, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety
beneath the roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated,
into a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his
wound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features of
the missionary.The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray
brows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the
sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with
filial caresses.His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious
glance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose
countenance he could not well distinguish."They told us it was not
dangerous.""No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this
manner.If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more
wrappings.They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank
wound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised one
of his hands to the bandage."How can you be
so unreasonable--at your age?"I will do what you wish, and keep it on."Then,
drawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to them in a low
voice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his eye:
"Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?He has
very much the look of a curate.You see, my children, you must be on your
guard; because--"

"He?"cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel."Without him,
we should not now be here to kiss you."cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure,
and gazing full at the missionary."It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche."Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the
shipwreck."it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more.With swelling heart,
and tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered him both his
hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe: "Sir,
I owe you the lives of these two children.I feel what a debt that
service lays upon me.I will not say more--because it includes
everything!"Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop!when I
was trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves,
was it not you that held out your hand to me?Yes--that light hair--that
youthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am sure of it!""Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see you
fall back into the sea.""I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already
said," answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: "in preserving these
children you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life.added the soldier, with admiration; "and so
young, with such a girlish look!""And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to
the priest.repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.asked the soldier, with increasing
astonishment."An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of mothers:
for she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as her
son.""Frances Baudoin--was it not?""It was, sir," answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn."Yes, of a brave soldier--who, from the most admirable devotion, is even
now passing his life in exile--far from his wife--far from his son, my
dear brother--for I am proud to call him by that name--"

"My Agricola!--my wife!--when did you leave them?"You the father of Agricola?--Oh!I knew not, until
now," cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, "I knew not all the
gratitude that I owed to heaven!"resumed Dagobert, in a trembling voice; "how are
they?"The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.""No; it is too much," cried Dagobert; "it is too much!"The veteran was
unable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and fell back
exhausted in a chair.And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father's
letter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of
Dagobert had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent
joy."Our Gabriel is the same as yours--what happiness!"he belongs to you as well as to me.Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with
affectionate warmth: "Your hand, my brave boy!"Yes--that's it--thank me!--after all thou has done for us!""Does my adopted mother know of your return?"asked Gabriel, anxious to
escape from the praises of the soldier."I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come alone;
there was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by.Does she still
live in the Rue Brise-Miche?"In that case, she must have received my letter.I wished to write to her
from the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.""Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I should
be still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had a
hand in--a good sort of devil, though.""That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself.These little
ladies," he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche, "pretended
to know more about it than I did, and were continually repeating: 'It was
the angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert--the good angel we told
thee of--though you said you would rather have Spoil sport to defend
us--'"

"Gabriel, I am waiting for you," said a stern voice, which made the
missionary start.They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog uttered
a deep growl.He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor.His
features were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance
at the soldier and sisters.said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in favor of
Rodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive."What the
mischief does he want?""I must go with him," answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful
constraint.Then, turning to Rodin, he added: "A thousand pardons!cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, "going the very instant
we have just met?I have too much to
tell you, and to ask in return.It
will be a real treat for me."He is my superior, and I must obey him.""Your superior?--why, he's in citizen's dress.""He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb."since he is not in uniform, and there is no provost-marshal in
your troop, send him to the--"

"Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to
remain.""I was right in disliking the phi of that man," muttered Dagobert between
his teeth.Then he added, with an air of impatience and vexation: "Shall
I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off by himself?""I beg you not to do so," said Gabriel; "it would be useless; I know my
duty, and have no will but my superior's.As soon as you arrive in Paris,
I will come and see you, as also my adopted mother, and my dear brother,
Agricola."I have been a soldier, and know what subordination
is," said Dagobert, much annoyed."One must put a good face on bad
fortune.So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue Brise-Miche, my boy; for
they tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow evening, and we set out
almost immediately.But I say--there seems to be a strict discipline with
you fellows!""Yes, it is strict and severe," answered Gabriel, with a shudder, and a
stifled sigh."Come, shake hands--and let's say farewell for the present.After all,
twenty-four hours will soon pass away."replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he returned
the friendly pressure of the veteran's hand.added the orphans, sighing also, and with tears in
their eyes.said Gabriel--and he left the room with Rodin, who
had not lost a word or an incident of this scene.Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
Paris, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too
much injured to proceed on his journey.The half-caste, Faringhea,
remained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow
countryman.We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of
Dagobert's wife.The following scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the
shipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House.Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one
end of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the
little square of the Cloister, near the church.At this end, the street,
or rather alley--for it is not more than eight feet wide--is shut in
between immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of
which excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the
year, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,
during the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate
everything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of
oblong well.It was about eight o'clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish light of
the street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men, stopping at
the angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few words together."So," said one, "you understand all about it.You are to watch in the
street, till you see them enter No."And when you see 'em enter so as to make quite sure of the game, go up
to Frances Baudoin's room--"

"Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
lives--the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.""Yes--and you must try and find out her address also--from her humpbacked
sister, if possible--for it is very important.Women of her feather
change their nests like birds, and we have lost track of her.""Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her
sister hangs out.""And, to give you steam, I'll wait for you at the tavern opposite the
Cloister, and we'll have a go of hot wine on your return.""I'll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold."This morning the water friz on my sprinkling-brush,
and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the church-door.a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses!""Luckily, you have the pickings--"

"Well, well--good luck to you!Don't forget the Fiver, the little passage
next to the dyer's shop."One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end
of the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry.This latter soon
found the number of the house he sought--a tall, narrow building, having,
like all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and
forwards in front of the door of No.If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor
of the interior cannot be described.5 was, in a special
degree, dirty and dilapidated.The water, which oozed from the wall,
trickled down the dark and filthy staircase.On the second floor, a wisp
of straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet
on; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the
sickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the
putrid exhalations of the drains.The few openings, cut at rare intervals
in the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint
rays of glimmering light.In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,
poor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working
classes.A dyer occupied the
ground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the
stench of the whole building.On the upper stories, several artisans
lodged with their families, or carried on their different trades.Up four
flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert.It consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by
a single candle.Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
wall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron
rod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often
washed, had preserved its natural color.At one end of this room was a
round iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes.On the wooden
table, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made
of iron--a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola
Baudoin, Dagobert's son.A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several
branches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very
coarsely, bore witness to the habits of the soldier's wife.Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously
fashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with
green cotton velvet (Agricola's first present to his mother), a few rush
bottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,
brown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a
worm-eaten door.The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and
household utensils.Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so
to the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two
mattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press
contained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert's wife occupied all to herself a
room as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to honest
and laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together--only too
happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets and
blankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker's.Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and
damp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son
Agricola's evening meal.Dagobert's wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close jacket of
blue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a white
handkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.Her
countenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive of
resignation and great kindness.It would have been difficult to find a
better, a more courageous mother.With no resource but her labor, she had
succeeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son
Agricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with
admirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later
life, by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most
violent exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost
suicidal.Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the
present), by sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn
about two shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to
educate her son and her adopted child.At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength
nearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing,
and had received such an education as children of the people can obtain.About this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and
Gabriel prepared to enter the priest's seminary, under the active
patronage of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances
Baudoin had become very frequent about the year 1820.This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those
simple natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial
approaches to heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life
of martyrdom--pure and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart
supply the place of the intellect!The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
simplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed
in yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had
now for many years been accustomed to submit.She regarded this influence
as most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration,
could have prevented her from obeying it.Did any dispute arise on the
subject, nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every
argument a resistance entirely free from passion--mild as her
disposition, calm as her conscience--but, like the latter, not to be
shaken.In a word, Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but
uninstructed and credulous beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and
dangerous hands, become, without knowing it, the instruments of much
evil.For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the
increasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;
unable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest
of her time at church.Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
working to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth
for her son's supper, with maternal care and solicitude.She took from
the press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very much
battered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut
like a knife.These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she
rubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her
son's plate.They were the most precious of her possessions, not so much
for what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the
associations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,
under the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been
compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker's.Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,
and one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her
son's plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of the
supper.Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his
mother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the
redness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal.After long
and painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the
conviction that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker,
would soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or
three hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors.Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her
eyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts
of work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she
had at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags
for the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the
rate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread.This work,
being very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and
her gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,
whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or
sickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices
to bring them in daily this miserable pittance.Thus do their gains
diminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and
infirmity must occasion.Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son.A first-rate
workman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his
labor brought him from four to five shillings a day--more than double
what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments.Admitting
therefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain
both her and himself.But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself
even some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously
liberal on the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of
visiting daily the parish church.Scarcely a day passed but she had
masses sung, or tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been
so long separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she
considered on the high-road to perdition.Agricola had so excellent a
heart, so loved and revered his mother, and considered her actions in
this respect inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never
complained when he saw a great part of his week's wages (which he paid
regularly over to his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect
as tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations
injurious at her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional
expenses.But what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when
she replied with tears: "My child, 'tis for the salvation of your father
and yours too."To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a
subject which Agricola, through respect for his mother's religious faith,
never discussed.He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her
dispense with comforts she might have enjoyed.THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very
much deformed.Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her
breast was sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders.Her face was
regular, but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it
expressed great sweetness and melancholy.Her blue eyes beamed with
kindness and intelligence.By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest
woman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse
net at the back of her head.Though
miserably clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful
struggle with her poverty.Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty
frock made of print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it
had been so often washed, that its primitive design and color had long
since disappeared.In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a
long familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of
taunting.From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her.We have said
that she was very deformed, and she was vulgarly called "Mother Bunch."Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every
moment reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though
they felt as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her,
never called her, however, by any other name.Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the
house in which Dagobert's wife had resided for more than twenty years;
and she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.There are wretches fatally doomed to misery.Mother Bunch had a very
pretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow
of a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she
treated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness.The latter would
often come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console
her, and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.Accustomed to pity her by their mother's example, instead of imitating
other children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her, Agricola
and Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when
their mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty.Cephyse was
intelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the
lively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and
pleasures--a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.Cephyse, listening at first to Frances's good advice, resigned herself to
her lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for about a
year.But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
insignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her
to--privations which often bordered on starvation--Cephyse, young,
pretty, of warm temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and
seductions--brilliant, indeed, for her, since they offered food to
satisfy her hunger, shelter from the cold, and decent raiment, without
being obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome
hovel--Cephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyer's clerk, who
forsook her soon after.She formed a connection with another clerk, whom
she (instructed by the examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman,
whom she afterwards cast off for other favorites.In a word, what with
changing and being forsaken, Cephyse, in the course of one or two years,
was the idol of a set of grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired
such a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her
decision of character, original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all
kinds of pleasures, and especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was
termed the Bacchanal Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of
this bewildering royalty.From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
intervals.She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain
her three-and-six a week.The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing
by Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army.For
these she received half-a-crown a dozen.They had to be hemmed, stitched,
provided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at
the most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely
succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week--an
excessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and
fourpence a week.And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental
nor uncommon.And this, because the remuneration given for women's work
is an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism.They are paid
not half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as tailors,
and makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.--no doubt because women can
work as well as men--because they are more weak and delicate--and because
their need may be twofold as great when they become mothers.Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week.That is to say,
toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in
keeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and
poverty--so numerous were her privations.The word
privation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all
that is necessary to preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome
air and shelter, sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing.Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all
that is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society
ought--yes--ought necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman
and workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed them of all
territorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at
least, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the
sea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for
shelter and for fuel.The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts,
considering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard
daily labor, which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable
him to live in the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less.For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life
from the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger,
and disease?And to show how far the mortification which society imposes
thus inexorably on its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its
careless disregard of all the questions which concern the just
remuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl
contrived to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
wretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which
leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity.Yes: to live at such a price is virtue!Yes, society thus organized,
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame
the poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because
they are cold and famishing.This poor girl spent her wages as follows:

    Six pounds of bread, second quality..0 8 1/2
    Four pails of water..0 2
    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5
    Coarse salt..0 0 3/4
    A bushel of charcoal..0 4
    A quart of dried vegetables..0 3
    Three quarts of potatoes..0 2
    Dips..0 3 1/4
    Thread and needles..0 2 1/2

To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
week at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story.There remained nine or ten pence a week
for clothes and lodging.By rare good fortune, her situation was in one
respect an exception to the lot of many others.Agricola, that he might
not wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the
housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a
small bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
shillings a year.But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the
porter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which
was twelve and sixpence.The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a
month left for her other expenses.But many workwomen, whose position is
less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a
piece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at
night patronize the "twopenny rope," one with another, in a wretched room
containing five or six beds, some of which are always engaged by men, as
male lodgers are by far the most abundant.Yes; and in spite of the
disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she
must submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have separate rooms
for females.To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor workwoman must
possess three or four shillings in ready money.But how save this sum,
out of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely
sufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less sufficient to
clothe her?The poor wretch must resign herself to this repugnant
cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes
weakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay
life," becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only means of improving
her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man made of money,"
who can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the
depravity of the lower orders!And yet, painful as the condition of the
working woman is, it is relatively fortunate.Should work fail her for
one day, two days, what then?Should sickness come--sickness almost
always occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary
attention, and good rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work
impossible; though not so dangerous as to procure the sufferer a bed in
an hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then?The mind
hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and
often of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again
this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts
whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
creatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly
enjoyed through Agricola's generosity, lived very miserably; and her
health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant
hardships.Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little
sacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she
earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service
which it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited
means of Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her
natural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and
humiliations.But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and
generous soul--a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that
this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been
brought up, and who had naturally the gift.This poor girl was the first
confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and
when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic
reverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong
natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would
be to her in her lonely and despised condition.One day, to Agricola's great surprise, who had just read some verses to
her, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to
him also a poetic composition.Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,
perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint
entrusted to a friendly hearer.From that day Agricola and she held
frequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but
with this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl's poetical
essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak
intellect.This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her
unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard
lot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding, but resigned; it was
especially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of
angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the
double burden of poverty and deformity.Yet she often expressed a sincere
free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she
admired beauty as she admired the sun.many were the verses of
hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine
face; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous
heart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits.The
young girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can
love, who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in
the depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation.She
did not seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so?Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola
explained the interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one
was surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830,
Agricola, after fighting intrepidly for the people's flag, was brought
bleeding home to his mother.Dagobert's son, deceived, like others, on
this point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect, this
love for him.Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
preparing her son's supper."Is it you, my poor love," said she; "I have not seen you since morning:
have you been ill?The young girl kissed Agricola's mother, and replied: "I was very busy
about some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have only
just finished it.I am going down to fetch some charcoal--do you want
anything while I'm out?""No, no, my child, thank you.It is half-past
eight, and Agricola is not come home."Then she added, after a sigh: "He
kills himself with work for me.Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl; my sight
is quite going.In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I cannot
see at all--not even to sew sacks.The idea of being a burden to my son
drives me distracted.""Oh, don't, ma'am, if Agricola heard you say that--"

"I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my
vexation.Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the
advantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy's, his good and worthy
master--instead of living in this dull garret, where it is scarcely light
at noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very little expense,
a good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a view of the
garden.not to mention that this place is so
far from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to it.""Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs.Baudoin," said
Mother Bunch; "besides, he knows how you cling to the house in which he
was born.M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola, in the
building put up for the workmen.""Yes, my child; but then I must give up church."But--be easy, I hear him," said the hunchback, blushing.A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs."At least, I'll not let him see that I have been crying," said the good
mother, drying her tears."This is the only moment of rest and ease from
toil he has--I must not make it sad to him."Our blacksmith poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of
age, was alert and robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and
aquiline nose, and an open, expressive countenance.His resemblance to
Dagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache which he
wore according to the fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his
chin.His cheeks, however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a
blue blouse, bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly
round his muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his
dress.The only thing which contrasted singularly with his working
habiliments was a handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he
held in his hand."Good-evening, mother," said he, as he came to kiss Frances immediately.Then, with a friendly nod, he added, "Good-evening, Mother Bunch.""You are very late, my child," said Frances, approaching the little stove
on which her son's simple meal was simmering; "I was getting very
anxious.""Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?"you won't excuse me for keeping the nice little supper
waiting that you get ready for me, for fear it should be spoilt, eh?"So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again."Have done, you naughty boy; you'll make me upset the pan.""That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully."I'll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I'm so
fond of."said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach."True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with
Mother Bunch; "but, talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages.""Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put
away the money, "what a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola."See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at
it, admire it, and especially smell it.You can't have a sweeter perfume;
a blending of vanilla and orange blossom.""Indeed, it does smell nice, child.said
Frances, admiringly; "where did you find it?"repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think
folks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue
Brise-Miche?"inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances's
curiosity.Well, I'll satisfy you, and explain why I
came home so late; for something else detained me.It has been an evening
of adventures, I promise you.I was hurrying home, when I heard a low,
gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just about
dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my
fist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its
paws.""Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands.Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that
did not bear the master's name, I looked beneath it, and saw a small
collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains.So I took a Lucifer
match from my 'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, 'FRISKY belongs
to Hon.Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No."Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I
came to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a
small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park.So,
looking up I saw 'No.7,' newly painted over a little door with a grated
slide.I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in observing me
through the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through),
the gate opened.And now, you'll not believe a word I have to say."said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her namesake of
elfish history.I am quite astounded, even now, at my
adventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.""Well, let us have it," said the worthy mother, so deeply interested that
she did not perceive her son's supper was beginning to burn."First," said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had excited, "a
young lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so beautifully and
gracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a beautiful
portrait of past times.Before I could say a word, she exclaimed, 'Ah!dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how happy Miss Adrienne will
be!Come, pray come in instantly; she would so regret not having an
opportunity to thank you in person!'And without giving me time to reply,
she beckoned me to follow her.Oh, dear mother, it is quite out of my
power to tell you, the magnificence I saw, as I passed through a small
saloon, partially lighted, and full of perfume!A door opened,--Oh, such a sight!I
was so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of gold and
light, crystal and flowers; and, amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady
of extreme beauty--ideal beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair
shining like gold!She had black eyes, ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as
snow.This is all I can recollect: for, as I said before, I was so
dazzled, I seemed to be looking through a veil.'Madame,' said the young
woman, whom I never should have taken for a lady's-maid, she was dressed
so elegantly, 'here is Frisky.This gentleman found him, and brought him
back.''Oh, sir,' said the young lady with the golden hair, in a sweet
silvery voice, 'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to
Frisky.'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank
me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to
me, though I must confess with some hesitation--'No doubt, sir, it gave
you some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some
valuable time--allow me--' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my
looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
at having wounded me, she said--'At least, sir, you will accept this
flower.'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she
understood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring
to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady's kind manner,
there was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall
and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the
red-haired young lady, 'He is here, Madame.'She immediately rose and
said to me, 'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am
indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all
occasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young
woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there
I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had
come out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on
seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done
in her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and
feeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and
generous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any
important case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,
towards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within
the reach of a work, girl's vision; but, making an involuntary comparison
of this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt
more cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and
gentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made
her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my
adventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now
for the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with
an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?'said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since
it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or
not."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,
containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected
gesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid
blush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this
handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do
you give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as
a pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to
think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this
flower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,
pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses
yesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
the flower against the side of it."Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,
"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
better for a little cooling to-night, won't it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's
head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is
late.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every
evening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a
good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since
I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better
seat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only
just dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never
prevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all
alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of
stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
day's toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,
during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast
without complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman
accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have
some more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of
luxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do
to-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem
very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not
satisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little
amusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you
did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said
Frances to her son.I don't propose the theatre; but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will
simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly
three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
us.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the
eyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
refusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck
his forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
punctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
mother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
might not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,
thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
of her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man
retorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
stoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola
left his mother's arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain
attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may
conceive the blacksmith's regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:
she is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with
a respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you
might have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I
regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do
you want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at
my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought
her proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young
person is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to
night; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
his moustache with pride."But that does not
astonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and
Dagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who
preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother
Bunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him
rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old
soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did
not light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night;" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced
towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep
with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will
share the young blacksmith's room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on
the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
post about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's
confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to
Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described
the most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A
flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
the roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so
nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be
seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who
had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks
were downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one
hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened
with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of
Agricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,
usually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion
by which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a
letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by
post in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the
housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some
trivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his
family.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
opened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low
voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But
what is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she
hastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the
light, and read what follows:

"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
to-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied
amazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyes:-"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared
libellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who
was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,
doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:

"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
trial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
whose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance
resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good
Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on
me.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the
time.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating
tone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and
listen to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two
months since my song was published.It is not in any way political;
indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very
neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the
verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness!If so, justice
would be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her
steps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to
me!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you
do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;
you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble
heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and
the wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your
wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than
you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these
times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
persons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And
then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite
insignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for
conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and
he was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the
letter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be
naturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,
and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them
without you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the
letter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error
though it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without
hearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,
bitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his
daily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my
mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.
Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,
that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their
persecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
added: "But no!After all, I had
rather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it
be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my
family will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen
to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep
so joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
democratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she
showed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a
generous heart.You must apply to her--"

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done
with this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "'Remember my name; and
in all circumstances address yourself to me?'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to
morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
support.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for
him.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
will have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what
could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you
understand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose
that you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety
for you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your
employment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,
Agricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is
noble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is
generous.The required surety will be
as nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be
the very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and
dejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the
young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is
true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any
other person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am
sure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far
above me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;
yes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that
which I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
heart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
youth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,
holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,
"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and
delicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over
into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally
devoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,
they sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the
world is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and
affection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to
hardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of
themselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
lady's house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I'll go down to watch at the
street-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you
of what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your
father," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,
is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your
present concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and
the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:

"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is
over; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet
him.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's
apartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest
its noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,
gayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my
dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not
seen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola's garret
being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite
of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the
conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
possessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she
loved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that
she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,
she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear
and cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's
garret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be
seen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
reverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of
Agricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,
suspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the
edge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had
dressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both
those of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I
wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
moustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;
have you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That's right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look
ye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good
for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old
carbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;
and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is
something good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for
the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this
is but the beginning!I am like the famished
wretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and
little that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to
be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,
I wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and
perplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed
that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
menaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good
to you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more
equitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in
his factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies
of Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what
affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;
who work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that
is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"
observed Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good
mother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a
sigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have
suffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well
in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You
shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in
beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold
father and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You
will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
are of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down
to say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes
to be regular at that: the good soul!and
during her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required
in a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.
Hardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must
be deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which
sustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put
off for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only
hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my
Agricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his
son's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now
that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of
business.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in
Paris?""I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some
important papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this
notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my
journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect
it."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
were two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as
thought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
while they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
become moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the
young men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at
length."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a
hundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping
for it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands
of Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a
hundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting
his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of
ineffable affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel
has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he
saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine
also."suddenly exclaimed
Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which
extended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the
young missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,
Dagobert said:

"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with
renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest
held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has
wounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the
missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken
down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon
which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and
agony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to
this upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands
have been pierced through!and Agricola became
grievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky
Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when
Providence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;
"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it
that they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be
implanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in
him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
and respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:
"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to
be about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took
with transport both of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as
glorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by
profession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,
with enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
resignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have
gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with
me?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes
of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every
one--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you
not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,
unarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by
artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,
alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await
death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,
without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness
issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and
this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe!can you still contend that you are not
as brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a
thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never
change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to
Dagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense
awaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I
will not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much
virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood
insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who
are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly
lawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their
vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
enfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
understand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"
and then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change
the conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:
be more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your
courage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the
spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling
heart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most
surprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by
night,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our
possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of
the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this
feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following
morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once
more to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm
became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my
horse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man
is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are
greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have
never abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
that the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my
request, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied
the missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived
by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I
awaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must
have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has
remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I
should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"

Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,
young and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the
distressed!'"asked Dagobert, singularly
interested."'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied," answered
the missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of
America--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,
where the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But
the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour
since broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have
been watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing
alarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure
you, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But
I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been
stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father
and me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother
has requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not
delay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should
depart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were
forgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to
yourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I'll come down."I'll come up
again to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,
to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his
garret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received
this letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:

"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon
with an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to
no other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General
Simon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address
was Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,
"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would
withdraw his father for about two days, during which time his
(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it
is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is
required on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall
be back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and
Gabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them
company.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not
possible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing
a sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again
into this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the
shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you
enrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of
the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is
already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock."This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
latter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him
to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him
solemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"
added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I
not?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will
you come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
accents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,
what could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon
us," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father
and a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I'll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest's
robe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,
that you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and
fearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A
FATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,
in Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing
than the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with
small squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre
effect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which
the fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was
surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
an arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front
overlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,
on this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,
formed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of
flowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de
Cardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,
lighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of
smaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
entire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic
clumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
the Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its
own, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them
a young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
breed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the
peristyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the
beautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth
year.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a
more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth
more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or
form smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,
Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,
with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with
rose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful
fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray
levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large
tuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a
hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,
surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and
flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,
reaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When
Georgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more
quickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful
ankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in
white silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish
satin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when
vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a
joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless
for the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had
introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was
not much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that
they trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and
petulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after
the happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon
the greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,
who advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
stopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in
advance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held
herself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up
of the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,
though of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy
consisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the
color of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was
pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;
he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs
sallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and
altogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a
"church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a
woman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was
dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay
and showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat
of the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in
her youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,
which were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and
austere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and
discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess
Saint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two
women present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even
to the animals which attended them.There were similar differences
between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When
the latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a
movement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the
young lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the
apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,
and even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the
cur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of
distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly
said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly
animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to
what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal
a smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It
regards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to
herself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken
your mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will
not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied
Georgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the
saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained
persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if
for ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest
coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having
been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even
unto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a
hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess's house, who has
too many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the
house.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,
and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter's
lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the
cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing
the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not
come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will
you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me
to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,
extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her
gait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o'clock in the
morning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my
story of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that
open's on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is
by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments
have not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her
niece's caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,
though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe
it!""Since you've gone so far, ma'am, I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by
your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"

"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor
Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has
passed.Re-enter at eight o'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own
eyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be
expected.All those to whom I am
going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
astonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or
fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of
Saint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,
the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss
de Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
in the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from
the sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of
their sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally
with the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,
alas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She
valued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the
delicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous
cluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
of SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady's character was extreme.Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
resolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish
that it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her
audacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well
as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and
blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose
piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who
entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either
placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met
in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she
resided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the
bath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne's dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker
who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,
or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
perfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived
for the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls
of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth
of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of
Adrienne's dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a
single large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of
ground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between
these two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with
furze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round
the ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet
damask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest
style, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended
over the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
decorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne's dressing
case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large
tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids
precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place
of a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the
farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
modesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet
of gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two
frosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting
of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles
of oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver
gilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich
divan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture
of this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the
sweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
before her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
attention and with a charming originality.We have already seen
Georgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing lady's maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
long golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
charming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
Venetian painters.Her slender waist curved
in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne's
women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so
pleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of
Hebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her
charming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The
physiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On
their features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing
and hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded
deference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the
zealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon
Adrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of
deference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from
the services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have
thought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her
person all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a
work of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they
were stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
window.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
than usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and
flexible as a bird's, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,
and all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the
comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots
of her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the
roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every
spot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,
could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now
they glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and
wit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep
a black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a
delightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those
of ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to
behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
like another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,
Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,
stood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her
small white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent
brightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves
of that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a
thousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all
directions.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays
from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's
forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they
adapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the
beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and
having upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied
herself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and
crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh
color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled
box, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling
hands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her
mistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe
the different operations of Adrienne's toilette with grave and reflective
attention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
a small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
and read aloud as follows:

"HONORED MADAME,

"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you
with respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,
with probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in
our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
of all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my
father, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and
their probity."She continued:

"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;
but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in
poverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted
from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin
came here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself
anew; "the secretary of Abbe d'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him
being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and
that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if
we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the
new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain
this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and
excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and
to relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to
acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much
as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill
it was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and
substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said
Adrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,
and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I
love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:

"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has
been our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like
honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,
honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who
are so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your
recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
a position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To
wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but
a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and
dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on
reading:

"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us
to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked
to think only of one's self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place
upon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were
conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still
remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,
and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He
is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he
appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a
little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
countrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of
an ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened
all my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of
the Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne's three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
interested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had
called him, continued to read Dupont's letter:

"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to
attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has
lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
greatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud
to proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by
the English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that
General Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his
service."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,
"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things
happen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in
truth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust
to me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only
necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of
countenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy
of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the
purchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian
vestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent
hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have
worn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful
hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is
not a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what
can either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome
young prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and
cashmere.Most assuredly I'll not miss this rare and unique opportunity
of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the
name--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is
this!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he
merits!"And then she read on:

"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give
him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer
a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so
unfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be
pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the
contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it
has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
sing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
recollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names
that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing
more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by
marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that
character.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are
not so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or
confound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid
European dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty
fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of
her women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The
young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials
for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I
await orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
all others:

"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,
with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,
sir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,
from the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and
correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will
choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all
things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you
will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere
shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
know so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another
quarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown
friend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is
necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will
add, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures
him to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you
will tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will
cause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he
finds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the
unknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,
modestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at
the opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though
this must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey
as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de
Babylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of
BABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Oriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to
be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
in this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is
because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
there is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly
resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient
days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to
my dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
princess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to
understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine
expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
generosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,
that I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress's
toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
order to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
happiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his
daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more
astonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so
sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one
another.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having
been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths
of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of
a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;
that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;
but that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent
by some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
surprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,
when I return to my mother after a day's toil, and often, even while
forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,
is, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass
of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest
claim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of
conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned
on very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will
become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to
regard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal
Simon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk
of being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety
for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for
the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor
will suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself
quite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in
the midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of
all, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"
said she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his
health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day
on which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly
at ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some
other means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for
the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever
be grateful."It is proper that those
who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who
have too little.Marshal Simon's daughters are members of my family, and
they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will
apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to
thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,
I shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
exclaiming:

"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said
Georgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,
as if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:
and now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and
are on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been
acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for
Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything
the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to
be voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But
in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and
escape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my
measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep
possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man
knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named
Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
importance.""That's my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a
trick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for
trick.added she, addressing herself to
Hebe."I answered, that I didn't know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my
aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is
rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
you will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come
in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
fears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves
you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget
them also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your
family.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
annoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will
come and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a
nobleman's left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,
"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of
concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all
searches.You will be very well
accommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the
place inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you
forget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you
have restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this
singular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are
entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother's, in
this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for
Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,
putting a paper into the duenna's hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o'clock.""But before nine o'clock she came home, after having passed the night out
of her house.Eight o'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do
not understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I
know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions.They don't distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
down all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew
the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I
have been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very
great mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are
free."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and
with tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who
placed me here.""In spite of one's self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so
confiding."But you are not here to sing her
praises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview
which she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of
what she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,
without Florine being able to hear her: "'They laugh most who laugh
last.'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would
tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I
advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.1518), under the heading,
"Thracum mores, etc.":

  "Uterque sexus epulantes focos ambiunt, herbarum quas habent
  semine ignibus superjecto.Cujus nidore perculsi pro laetitia
  habent imitari ebrietatem sensibus sauciatis."JARLTZBERG's reference to Herod.36. supplies nothing to the point:
Herod.2. mentions the use of bone pipes, [Greek: physeteras
osteinous], by the Scythians, _in milking_; but Herodotus (iv.describes the orgies of the Scythians, who produced intoxicating fumes
by strewing hemp-seed upon red-hot stones, as the leaves and seed of the
Hasisha al fokara, or hemp-plant, are smoked in the East at the present
day.(See De Sacy, _Chrestom.Compare also
Plutarch de Fluviis (_de Hebro_, fr.), who speaks of a plant
resembling Origanum, from which the Thracians procured a stupefying
vapour, by burning the stalks:

edition of Milton's _Works_, in 1809, p.158., mentions the rumour,
without expressing any opinion of its truth.I think he omits all
mention of it in his subsequent edition in 1826, and therefore hope he
has adopted the prevailing opinion that it is a contemptible libel.In a
note to the former edition is a reference to Kennett's _Register_, p.38., and to _"Private forms of Prayer fitted for the late sad times,"
&c._, 12mo., Lond., 1660, attributed to Dr.An anonymous
author, quoting the verbal assurance of "a certain active Whigg," would
be entitled to little credit in attacking the character of the living,
and ought surely to be scouted when assailing the memory of the dead.In
Lowndes' _Bib.Man._ it is stated that

  "This miserable trash has been attributed to the author of
  Hudibras."_Voltaire's Henriade_ (Vol.).--I have two translations of
this poem in English verse, in addition to that mentioned at p.330.,
viz., one in 4to., Anon., London, 1797; and one by Daniel French, 8vo.,
London, 1807.The former, which, as I collect from the preface, was
written by a lady and a foreigner, alludes to two previous translations,
one in blank verse (probably Lockman's), and the other in rhyme.).--Your correspondent C. H.
appears to give me too much credit for diligence, in having "searched"
after this document; for in truth I did nothing beyond writing to the
rector of the parish, the Rev.All that I can positively
say as to my letter, is, that it was intended to be courteous; that it
stated my reason for the inquiry; that it contained an apology for the
liberty taken in applying to a stranger; and that Mr.Sockett did not
honour me with any answer.I believe, however, that I asked whether the
register still existed; if so, what was its nature, and over what period
it extended; and whether it had been printed or described in any
antiquarian or topographical book.Perhaps some reader may have the means of giving information on these
points; and if he will do so through the medium of your periodical, he
will oblige both C. H. and myself.Or perhaps C. H. may be able to
inquire through some more private channel, in which case I should feel
myself greatly indebted to him if he would have the goodness to let me
know the result.).--The solution of J. H. M. to MR."Alternate layers of sliced pippins
and mutton steaks" might indeed make a pie, but not an apple-pie,
therefore this puzzling phrase must have had some other origin.An
ingenious friend of mine has suggested that it may perhaps be derived
from that expression which we meet with in one of the scenes of
_Hamlet_, "Cap a pied;" where it means perfectly appointed.The
transition from _cap a pied_, or "cap a pie," to _apple-pie_, has rather
a rugged appearance, orthographically, I admit; but the ear soon becomes
accustomed to it in pronunciation.ROBERT SNOW and several other correspondents have also
  suggested that the origin of the phrase "apple-pie order" is to
  be found in the once familiar "cap a pied."]_Durham Sword that killed the Dragon_ (Vol.).--For details
of the tradition, and an engraving of the sword, see Surtees' _History
of Durham_, vol.--Your correspondent F. E. M. will find
the word _Malentour_, or _Malaentour_, given in Edmondson's _Complete
Body of Heraldry_ as the motto of the family of Patten alias Wansfleet
(_sic_) of Newington, Middlesex: it is said to be borne on a scroll over
the crest, which is a Tower in flames.In the "Book of Mottoes" the motto ascribed to the name of Patten is
_Mal au Tour_, and the double meaning is suggested, "Misfortune to the
Tower," and "Unskilled in artifice."The arms that accompany it in Edmondson are nearly the same as those of
William Pattyn alias Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor
temp.VI.--the founder of Magdalen College, Oxford._The Bellman and his History_ (Vol.).--Since my
former communication on this subject I have been referred to the cut of
the Bellman and his _Dog_ in Collier's _Roxburghe Ballads_, p.59.,
taken from the first edition of Dekker's _Belman of London_, printed in
1608."_Geographers on Afric's Downs_" (Vol.).--Is your
correspondent A. S. correct in his quotation?In a poem of Swift's, "On
Poetry, a Rhapsody," are these lines:--

      "So geographers, in Afric maps
      With savage pictures fill their gaps,
      And o'er unhabitable downs
      Place elephants for want of towns."_Swift's Works, with Notes by Dr.Hawksworth_, 1767,
      vol."_Trepidation talk'd_" (Vol.).--The words attributed to
Milton are--

      "That crystalline sphere whose balance weighs
      The trepidation talk'd, and that first moved."Paterson's comment, quoted by your correspondent, is exquisite: he
evidently thinks there were two trepidations, one _talked_, the other
_first moved_.The _trepidation_ (not a tremulous, but a turning or oscillating motion)
is a well-known hypothesis added by the Arab astronomers to Ptolemy, in
explanation of the precession of the equinoxes.This precession they
imagined would continue retrograde for a long period, after which it
would be direct for another long period, then retrograde again, and so
on.They, or their European followers, I forget which, invented the
_crystal_ heaven, an apparatus outside of the _starry_ heaven (these
cast-off phrases of astronomy have entered into the service of poetry,
and the _empyreal_ heaven with them), to cause this slow turning, or
trepidation, in the starry heaven.Some used _two_ crystal heavens, and
I suspect that Paterson, having some confused idea of this, fancied he
found them both in Milton's text.I need not say that your correspondent
is quite right in referring the words _first moved_ to the _primum
mobile_.Again, _balance_ in Milton never _weighs_.Where he says of Satan's army (i.),

          "In even balance down they light
      On the firm brimstone,"

he appears to mean that they were in regular order, with a right wing to
balance the left wing.The direct motion of the crystal heaven,
following and compensating the retrograde one, is the "balance" which
"_was_ the trepidation _called_;" and this I suspect to be the true
reading.The past tense would be quite accurate, for all the Ptolemaists
of Milton's time had abandoned the _trepidation_.As the text stands it
is nonsense; even if Milton did _dictate_ it, we know that he never
_saw_ it; and there are several passages of which the obscurity may be
due to his having had to rely on others._Registry of Dissenting Baptisms in Churches_ (Vol.).--I
forward extracts from the Registers of the parish of Saint Benedict in
this town relating to the baptism of Dissenters.Hussey, mentioned
in several of the entries, was Joseph Hussey, minister of a Dissenting
congregation here from 1691 to 1720.His meeting-house on Hog Hill (now
St.Andrew's Hill) in this town was pillaged by a Jacobite mob, 29th
May, 1716.He died in London in 1726, and was the author of several
works, which are now very scarce.)William the Son of Richard Jardine and
  Elisabeth his Wife was baptiz'd in a Private Congregation by Mr.Hussey in ye name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost."Witnesses, Robert Wilson, Richard Jardine.Henery the Son of John and Sarah Shipp was baptized in a
  Private Congregation by Mr.Elisabeth the
  Daughter of Richard and Elisabeth Jardine was born ye twenty-first
  day of January and baptized the second day of February 1698/99 in
  a Private Congregation.Walter the Son of Richard and Elisabeth Jardine born July
  23 and said to be baptized in a Separate Congregation by Mr.Elisabeth Daughter of Richard Jardine and Elisabeth his
  wife born October 7. and said to be baptized at a Private
  Congregation Novemb.Miram the Son of Thomas Short and Mary his Wife
  said to be baptized at a Separate Congregation.Jane the Daughter
  of Richard Jardine and Elizabeth his Wife said to be baptized at a
  Separate Congregation Dec.John the Son of Alexander Jardine and Elisabeth his Wife
  said to be baptized at a Separate Congregation, Mar.Alexander the Son of Alexander Jardine and... his Wife was
  as 'tis said baptized in a Separate Congregation July 1705.John the Son of Alexander Jardine and Elisabeth his Wife
  said to be baptized at a Private Congregation Dec.Jardine was
  said to be baptized in Separate Congregation.John ye Son of Bryan and Sarah Ellis was said to
  have been baptized in Separate Congregation.ye Son of Alexander and Elisa Jardine was
    said to be baptiz'd in a Separate Congregation."I have no recollection of having met with similar entries in any other
Parish Register.).--I think that upon further
consideration C. J. A. will find his egg to be merely that of a
blackbird.While the eggs of some birds are so constant in their
markings that to see one is to know all, others--at the head of which we
may place the sparrow, the gull tribe, the thrush, and the
blackbird--are as remarkable for the curious variety of their markings,
and even of the shades of their colouring.And every schoolboy's
collection will show that these distinctions will occur in the same
nest.I also believe that there has been some mistake about the nest, for
though, like the thrush, the blackbird coats the interior of its nest
with mud, &c., it does not, like that bird, leave this coating exposed,
but adds another lining of soft dried grass.PH***., asks
"What is Champak?"He will find a full description of the plant in Sir
William Jones's "Botanical Observations on Select Indian Plants," vol.In speaking of it, he says:

  "The strong aromatic scent of the gold-coloured Champac is thought
  offensive to the bees, who are never seen on its blossoms; but
  their elegant appearance on the black hair of the Indian women is
  mentioned by Rumphius; and both facts have supplied the Sanscrit
  poets with elegant allusions."D. C.




MISCELLANEOUS.NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.The first volume issued to the members of the Camden Society in return
for the present year's subscription affords in more than one way
evidence of the utility of that Society.It is an account _of Moneys
received and paid for Secret Services of Charles II.and James II._, and
is edited by Mr.in the possession of William Selby
Lowndes, Esq.Of the value of the book as materials towards illustrating
the history of the period over which the payments extend, namely from
March 1679 to December 1688, there can be as little doubt, as there can
be that but for the Camden Society it never could have been published.As a publishing speculation it could not have tempted any bookseller;
even if its owner would have consented to its being so given to the
world: and yet that in the simple entries of payments to the Duchess of
Portsmouth, to "Mrs.Ellinor Gwynne," to "Titus Oates," to the
Pendrells, &c., will be found much to throw light upon many obscure
passages of this eventful period of our national history, it is probable
that future editions of Mr.Macaulay's brilliant narrative of it will
afford ample proof._The Antiquarian Etching Club_, which was instituted two or three years
since for the purpose of rescuing from oblivion, and preserving by means
of the graver, objects of antiquarian interest, has just issued the
first part of its publications for 1851.This contains twenty-one plates
of various degrees of merit, but all of great interest to the antiquary,
who looks rather for fidelity of representation than for artistic
effect.CATALOGUES RECEIVED.--G.High Holborn), Catalogue, Part

  ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENQUIRIES RELATING To Mesmerism.Part I. By the
  REV.S. R. MAITLAND, DD.Sometime Librarian to the
  late Archbishop of Canterbury, and Keeper of the MSS."One of the most valuable and interesting pamphlets we ever
    read."--_Morning Herald._

    "This publication, which promises to be the commencement of a
    larger work, will well repay serious perusal."--_Ir.Journ._

    "A small pamphlet in which he throws a startling light on the
    practices of modern Mesmerism."--_Nottingham Journal._

    "Dr.Maitland, we consider, has here brought Mesmerism to the
    'touchstone of truth,' to the test of the standard of right or
    wrong.We thank him for this first instalment of his inquiry, and
    hope that he will not long delay the remaining portions."--_London
    Medical Gazette._

    "The Enquiries are extremely curious, we should indeed say
    important.That relating to the Witch of Endor is one of the most
    successful we ever read.We cannot enter into particulars in this
    brief notice; but we would strongly recommend the pamphlet even to
    those who care nothing about Mesmerism, or _angry_ (for it has
    come to this at last) with the subject."--_Dublin Evening Post._

    "We recommend its general perusal as being really an endeavour, by
    one whose position gives him the best facilities, to ascertain the
    genuine character of Mesmerism, which is so much
    disputed."--_Woolmer's Exeter Gazette._

    "Dr.Maitland has bestowed a vast deal of attention on the subject
    for many years past, and the present pamphlet is in part the
    result of his thoughts and inquiries.There is a good deal in it
    which we should have been glad to quote... but we content
    ourselves with referring our readers to the pamphlet
    itself."--_Brit.Mag._

    which Mr.Foss has brought to light many points previously
    unknown, corrected many errors, and shown such ample knowledge of
    his subject as to conduct it successfully through all the
    intricacies of a difficult investigation; and such taste and
    judgment as will enable him to quit, when occasion requires, the
    dry details of a professional inquiry, and to impart to his work
    as he proceeds, the grace and dignity of a philosophical
    history."--_Gent.Mag._

  view of the History of English Architecture, from the Heptarchy to

    of Rickman are worthy of attention, coming from an author who has
    entered very deeply into the analysis of Gothic architecture, and
    who has, in his 'Architectural Parallels,' followed a method of
    demonstration which has the highest possible
    value."--_Architectural Quarterly Review._

    "The author of one of the noblest architectural works of modern
    times.His 'Architectural Parallels' are worthy of the best days
    of art, and show care and knowledge of no common kind.All his
    lesser works have been marked in their degree by the same careful
    and honest spirit.His attempt to discriminate our architecture
    into periods and assign to it a new nomenclature, is therefore
    entitled to considerable respect."--_Guardian._

      | INDEX TO THE SECOND VOLUME.MAY-DEC., 1850    | PG # 13571  |
      | INDEX TO THE THIRD VOLUME.The _nofre_, a kind of guitar, was almost identical in construction
with the Tamboura at the present day in use among several eastern
nations.It was evidently a great favourite with the ancient
Egyptians.A figure of it is found among their hieroglyphs, signifying
“good.” It occurs in representations of concerts dating earlier than
from B.C.The _nofre_ affords the best proof that the Egyptians
had made considerable progress in music at a very early age; since it
shows that they understood how to produce on a few strings, by means of
the finger-board, a greater number of notes than were obtainable even
on their harps.The instrument had two or four strings, was played with
a plectrum and appears to have been sometimes, if not always, provided
with frets.In the British museum is a fragment of a fresco obtained
from a tomb at Thebes, on which two female performers on the _nofre_
are represented.Small pipes of the Egyptians have been discovered, made of reed, with
three, four, five, or more finger-holes.There are some interesting
examples in the British museum; one of which has seven holes burnt in
at the side.Two straws were found with it of nearly the same length
as the pipe, which is about one foot long.In some other pipes pieces
of a kind of thick straw have also been found inserted into the tube,
obviously serving for a similar purpose as the _reed_ in our oboe or
clarionet.The _sêbi_, a single flute, was of considerable length, and the
performer appears to have been obliged to extend his arms almost at
full length in order to reach the furthest finger-hole.As _sêbi_
is also the name of the leg-bone (like the Latin _tibia_) it may be
supposed that the Egyptian flute was originally made of bone.Those,
however, which have been found are of wood or reed.A flute-concert is painted on one of the tombs in the pyramids of Gizeh
and dates, according to Lepsius, from an age earlier than B.C.Eight musicians (as seen in the woodcut) are performing on flutes.Three of them, one behind the other, are kneeling and holding their
flutes in exactly the same manner.Facing these are three others, in a
precisely similar position.A seventh is sitting on the ground to the
left of the six, with his back turned towards them, but also in the
act of blowing his flute, like the others.An eighth is standing at the
right side of the group with his face turned towards them, holding his
flute before him with both hands, as if he were going to put it to his
mouth, or had just left off playing.He is clothed, while the others
have only a narrow girdle round their loins.Perhaps he is the director
of this singular band, or the _solo_ performer who is waiting for the
termination of the _tutti_ before renewing his part of the performance.The division of the players into two sets, facing each other, suggests
the possibility that the instruments were classed somewhat like the
first and second violins, or the _flauto primo_ and _flauto secondo_ of
our orchestras.The occasional employment of the interval of the third,
or the fifth, as accompaniment to the melody, is not unusual even with
nations less advanced in music than were the ancient Egyptians.[Illustration]

The Double-Pipe, called _mam_, appears to have been a very popular
instrument, if we judge from the frequency of its occurrence in
the representations of musical performances.Furthermore, the
Egyptians had, as far as is known to us, two kinds of trumpets;
three kinds of tambourines, or little hand drums; three kinds of
drums, chiefly barrel-shaped; and various kinds of gongs, bells,
cymbals, and castanets.The trumpet appears to have been usually of
brass.A peculiar wind-instrument, somewhat the shape of a champagne
bottle and perhaps made of pottery or wood, occurs only once in the
representations transmitted to us.The Egyptian drum was from two to three feet in length, covered with
parchment at both ends and braced by cords.The performer carried it
before him, generally by means of a band over his shoulder, while he
was beating it with his hands on both ends.Of another kind of drum an
actual specimen has been found in the excavations made in the year 1823
at Thebes.It was 1½ feet high and 2 feet broad, and had cords for
bracing it.A piece of catgut encircled each end of the drum, being
wound round each cord, by means of which the cords could be tightened
or slackened at pleasure by pushing the two bands of catgut towards or
from each other.It was beaten with two drumsticks slightly bent.The
Egyptians had also straight drumsticks with a handle, and a knob at
the end.The third kind of
drum was almost identical with the _darabouka_ (or _darabukkeh_) of the
modern Egyptians.The Tambourine was either round, like that which is
at the present time in use in Europe as well as in the east; or it was
of an oblong square shape, slightly incurved on the four sides.The Sistrum consisted of a frame of bronze or brass into which three
or four metal bars were loosely inserted, so as to produce a jingling
noise when the instrument was shaken.The bars were often made in
the form of snakes, or they terminated in the head of a goose.Not
unfrequently a few metal rings were strung on the bars, to increase
the noise.The frame was sometimes ornamented with the figure of a cat.The largest sistra which have been found are about eighteen inches in
length, and the smallest about nine inches.The sistrum was principally
used by females in religious performances.Its Egyptian name was
_seshesh_.The Egyptian cymbals closely resembled our own in shape.There are two
pairs of them in the British museum.One pair was found in a coffin
enclosing the mummy of a sacred musician, and is deposited in the same
case with the mummy and coffin.Among the Egyptian antiquities in the
British museum are also several small bells of bronze.The largest is
2¼ inches in height, and the smallest three-quarters of an inch.Some of them have a hole at the side near the top wherein the clapper
was fastened.Our acquaintance with the Assyrian instruments has been derived almost
entirely from the famous bas-reliefs which have been excavated from the
mounds of Nimroud, Khorsabad, and Kouyunjik, situated near the river
Tigris in the vicinity of the town of Mosul in Asiatic Turkey.The Assyrian harp was about four feet high, and appears of larger size
than it actually was on account of the ornamental appendages which were
affixed to the lower part of its frame.It must have been but light in
weight, since we find it not unfrequently represented in the hands of
persons who are playing upon it while they are dancing.Like all the
Oriental harps, modern as well as ancient, it was not provided with a
front pillar.The upper portion of the frame contained the sound-holes,
somewhat in the shape of an hour-glass.Below them were the screws, or
tuning-pegs, arranged in regular order.The strings were perhaps made
of silk, like those which the Burmese use at the present time on their
harps; or they may have been of catgut, which was used by the ancient
Egyptians.The largest assemblage of Assyrian musicians which has been discovered
on any monument consists of eleven performers upon instruments, besides
a chorus of singers.The first musician--probably the leader of the
band, as he marches alone at the head of the procession--is playing
upon a harp.Behind him are two men; one with a dulcimer and the
other with a double-pipe: then follow two men with harps.Next come
six female musicians, four of whom are playing upon harps, while one
is blowing a double-pipe and another is beating a small hand-drum
covered only at the top.Close behind the instrumental performers are
the singers, consisting of a chorus of females and children.They are
clapping their hands in time with the music, and some of the musicians
are dancing to the measure.One of the female singers is holding her
hand to her throat in the same manner as the women in Syria, Arabia,
and Persia are in the habit of doing at the present day when producing,
on festive occasions, those peculiarly shrill sounds of rejoicing which
have been repeatedly noticed by travellers.The dulcimer is in too imperfect a state on the bas-relief to
familiarize us with its construction.The slab representing the
procession in which it occurs has been injured; the defect which
extended over a portion of the dulcimer has been repaired, and it
cannot be said that in repairing it much musical knowledge has been
evinced.The instrument of the Trigonon species was held horizontally, and was
twanged with a rather long plectrum slightly bent at the end at which
it was held by the performer.It is of frequent occurrence on the
bas-reliefs.A number of them appear to have been generally played
together.At any rate, we find almost invariably on the monuments two
together, evidently implying “more than one,” “a number.” The left hand
of the performer seems to have been occupied in checking the vibration
of the strings when its discontinuance was required.From the position
of the strings the performer could not have struck them as those of
the dulcimer are struck.If he did not twang them, he may have drawn
the plectrum across them.Indeed, for twanging, a short plectrum would
have been more practical, considering that the strings are placed
horizontally one above the other at regular distances.It is therefore
by no means improbable that we have here a rude prototype of the violin
bow.The Lyre occurs in three different forms, and is held horizontally
in playing, or at least nearly so.Its front bar was generally either
oblique or slightly curved.The strings were tied round the bar so as
to allow of their being pushed upwards or downwards.In the former case
the tension of the strings increases, and the notes become therefore
higher; on the other hand, if the strings are pushed lower down the
pitch of the notes must become deeper.The lyre was played with a small
plectrum as well as with the fingers.The Assyrian trumpet was very similar to the Egyptian.Furthermore, we
meet with three kinds of drums, of which one is especially noteworthy
on account of its odd shape, somewhat resembling a sugar-loaf; with
the tambourine; with two kinds of cymbals; and with bells, of which
a considerable number have been found in the mound of Nimroud.These
bells, which have greatly withstood the devastation of time, are but
small in size, the largest of them being only 3¼ inches in height
and 2½ inches in diameter.Most of them have a hole at the top, in
which probably the clapper was fastened.They are made of copper mixed
with 14 per cent.Instrumental music was used by the Assyrians and Babylonians in their
religious observances.This is obvious from the sculptures, and is to
some extent confirmed by the mode of worship paid by command of king
Nebuchadnezzar to the golden image: “Then an herald cried aloud, To
you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, that at what
time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden
image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.” The kings appear
to have maintained at their courts musical bands, whose office it
was to perform secular music at certain times of the day or on fixed
occasions.Of king Darius we are told that, when he had cast Daniel
into the den of lions, he “went to his palace, and passed the night
fasting, neither were instruments of musick brought before him;” from
which we may conclude that his band was in the habit of playing before
him in the evening.A similar custom prevailed also at the court of
Jerusalem, at least in the time of David and Solomon; both of whom
appear to have had their royal private bands, besides a large number of
singers and instrumental performers of sacred music who were engaged in
the Temple.As regards the musical instruments of the Hebrews, we are from biblical
records acquainted with the names of many of them; but representations
to be trusted are still wanting, and it is chiefly from an examination
of the ancient Egyptian and Assyrian instruments that we can conjecture
almost to a certainty their construction and capabilities.From various
indications, which it would be too circumstantial here to point out, we
believe the Hebrews to have possessed the following instruments:

THE HARP.There cannot be a doubt that the Hebrews possessed the
harp, seeing that it was a common instrument among the Egyptians
and Assyrians.But it is uncertain which of the Hebrew names of the
stringed instruments occurring in the Bible really designates the harp.Some writers on Hebrew music consider the _nebel_ to have
been a kind of dulcimer; others conjecture the same of the _psanterin_
mentioned in the book of Daniel,--a name which appears to be synonymous
with the _psalterion_ of the Greeks, and from which also the present
oriental dulcimer, _santir_, may have been derived.Some of the
instruments mentioned in the book of Daniel may have been synonymous
with some which occur in other parts of the Bible under Hebrew names;
the names given in Daniel being Chaldæan.The _asor_ was a ten-stringed
instrument played with a plectrum, and is supposed to have borne some
resemblance to the _nebel_.This instrument is represented on some Hebrew coins generally
ascribed to Judas Maccabæus, who lived in the second century before the
Christian era.There are several of them in the British museum; some
are of silver, and the others of copper.On three of them are lyres
with three strings, another has one with five, and another one with six
strings.The two sides of the frame appear to have been made of the
horns of animals, or they may have been of wood formed in imitation of
two horns which originally were used.Lyres thus constructed are still
found in Abyssinia.The Hebrew square-shaped lyre of the time of Simon
Maccabæus is probably identical with the _psalterion_.The _kinnor_,
the favourite instrument of king David, was most likely a lyre if not a
small triangular harp.The lyre was evidently an universally known and
favoured instrument among ancient eastern nations.Being more simple
in construction than most other stringed instruments it undoubtedly
preceded them in antiquity.The _kinnor_ is mentioned in the Bible as
the oldest stringed instrument, and as the invention of Jubal.Even
if the name of one particular stringed instrument is here used for
stringed instruments in general, which may possibly be the case, it
is only reasonable to suppose that the oldest and most universally
known stringed instrument would be mentioned as a representative of
the whole class rather than any other.Besides, the _kinnor_ was a
light and easily portable instrument; king David, according to the
Rabbinic records, used to suspend it during the night over his pillow.All its uses mentioned in the Bible are especially applicable to the
lyre.And the resemblance of the word _kinnor_ to _kithara_, _kissar_,
and similar names known to denote the lyre, also tends to confirm
the supposition that it refers to this instrument.It is, however,
not likely that the instruments of the Hebrews--indeed their music
altogether--should have remained entirely unchanged during a period
of many centuries.Some modifications were likely to occur even from
accidental causes; such, for instance, as the influence of neighbouring
nations when the Hebrews came into closer contact with them.Thus
may be explained why the accounts of the Hebrew instruments given by
Josephus, who lived in the first century of the Christian era, are not
in exact accordance with those in the Bible.The lyres at the time of
Simon Maccabæus may probably be different from those which were in use
about a thousand years earlier, or at the time of David and Solomon
when the art of music with the Hebrews was at its zenith.There appears to be a probability that a Hebrew lyre of the time of
Joseph (about 1700 B.C.)is represented on an ancient Egyptian painting
discovered in a tomb at Beni Hassan,--which is the name of certain
grottoes on the eastern bank of the Nile.Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his
“Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,” observes: “If, when we
become better acquainted with the interpretation of hieroglyphics, the
‘Strangers’ at Beni Hassan should prove to be the arrival of Jacob’s
family in Egypt, we may examine the Jewish lyre drawn by an Egyptian
artist.That this event took place about the period when the inmate
of the tomb lived is highly probable--at least, if I am correct in
considering Osirtasen I. to be the Pharaoh the patron of Joseph; and
it remains for us to decide whether the disagreement in the number
of persons here introduced--thirty-seven being written over them in
hieroglyphics--is a sufficient objection to their identity.It will
not be foreign to the present subject to introduce those figures which
are curious, if only considered as illustrative of ancient customs
at that early period, and which will be looked upon with unbounded
interest should they ever be found to refer to the Jews.The first
figure is an Egyptian scribe, who presents an account of their arrival
to a person seated, the owner of the tomb, and one of the principal
officers of the reigning Pharaoh.The next, also an Egyptian, ushers
them into his presence; and two advance bringing presents, the wild
goat or ibex and the gazelle, the productions of their country.Four
men, carrying bows and clubs, follow, leading an ass on which two
children are placed in panniers, accompanied by a boy and four women;
and, last of all, another ass laden, and two men--one holding a bow and
club, the other a lyre, which he plays with a plectrum.All the men
have beards, contrary to the custom of the Egyptians, but very general
in the East at that period, and noticed as a peculiarity of foreign
uncivilized nations throughout their sculptures.The men have sandals,
the women a sort of boot reaching to the ankle--both which were worn by
many Asiatic people.The lyre is rude, and differs in form from those
generally used in Egypt.” In the engraving the lyre-player, another
man, and some strange animals from this group, are represented.[Illustration]

THE TAMBOURA._Minnim_, _machalath_, and _nebel_ are usually supposed
to be the names of instruments of the lute or guitar kind._Minnim_,
however, appears more likely to imply stringed instruments in general
than any particular instrument._Chalil_ and _nekeb_ were the names of the Hebrew
pipes or flutes.Probably the _mishrokitha_ mentioned in Daniel.The
_mishrokitha_ is represented in the drawings of our histories of music
as a small organ, consisting of seven pipes placed in a box with a
mouthpiece for blowing.But the shape of the pipes and of the box as
well as the row of keys for the fingers exhibited in the representation
of the _mishrokitha_ have too much of the European type not to suggest
that they are probably a product of the imagination.Respecting the
illustrations of Hebrew instruments which usually accompany historical
treatises on music and commentaries on the Bible, it ought to be borne
in mind that most of them are merely the offspring of conjectures
founded on some obscure hints in the Bible, or vague accounts by the
Rabbins.THE SYRINX OR PANDEAN PIPE.Probably the _ugab_, which in the English
authorized version of the Bible is rendered “organ.”

THE BAGPIPE.The word _sumphonia_, which occurs in the book of
Daniel, is, by Forkel and others, supposed to denote a bagpipe.It
is remarkable that at the present day the bagpipe is called by the
Italian peasantry Zampogna.Another Hebrew instrument, the _magrepha_,
generally described as an organ, was more likely only a kind of
bagpipe.The _magrepha_ is not mentioned in the Bible but is described
in the Talmud.In tract Erachin it is recorded to have been a powerful
organ which stood in the temple at Jerusalem, and consisted of a case
or wind-chest, with ten holes, containing ten pipes.Each pipe was
capable of emitting ten different sounds, by means of finger-holes or
some similar contrivance: thus one hundred different sounds could be
produced on this instrument.Further, the _magrepha_ is said to have
been provided with two pairs of bellows and with ten keys, by means of
which it was played with the fingers.Its tone was, according to the
Rabbinic accounts, so loud that it could be heard at an incredibly long
distance from the temple.Authorities so widely differ that we must
leave it uncertain whether the much-lauded _magrepha_ was a bagpipe,
an organ, or a kettle-drum.Of the real nature of the Hebrew bagpipe
perhaps some idea may be formed from a syrinx with bellows, which has
been found represented on one of the ancient terra-cottas excavated in
Tarsus, Asia-minor, some years since, and here engraved.These remains
are believed to be about 2000 years old, judging from the figures upon
them, and from some coins struck about 200 years B.C.We have therefore before us, probably, the oldest
representation of a bagpipe hitherto discovered.[Illustration]

THE TRUMPET.Three kinds are mentioned in the Bible, viz.the _keren_,
the _shophar_, and the _chatzozerah_.The first two were more or less
curved and might properly be considered as horns.Most commentators are
of opinion that the _keren_--made of ram’s horn--was almost identical
with the _shophar_, the only difference being that the latter was more
curved than the former.The _shophar_ is especially remarkable as being
the only Hebrew musical instrument which has been preserved to the
present day in the religious services of the Jews.It is still blown in
the synagogue, as in time of old, at the Jewish new-year’s festival,
according to the command of Moses (Numb.The _chatzozerah_
was a straight trumpet, about two feet in length, and was sometimes
made of silver.Two of these straight trumpets are shown in the famous
triumphal procession after the fall of Jerusalem on the arch of Titus,
engraved on the next page.There can be no doubt that the Hebrews had several kinds of
drums.We know, however, only of the _toph_, which appears to have
been a tambourine or a small hand-drum like the Egyptian darabouka.In the English version of the Bible the word is rendered _timbrel_
or _tabret_.This instrument was especially used in processions on
occasions of rejoicing, and also frequently by females.We find it
in the hands of Miriam, when she was celebrating with the Israelitish
women in songs of joy the destruction of Pharaoh’s host; and in the
hands of Jephtha’s daughter, when she went out to welcome her father.There exists at the present day in the East a small hand-drum called
_doff_, _diff_, or _adufe_--a name which appears to be synonymous with
the Hebrew _toph_.[Illustration]

THE SISTRUM.Winer, Saalfchütz, and several other commentators are of
opinion that the _menaaneim_, mentioned in 2 Sam.In the English Bible the original is translated _cymbals_.The _tzeltzclim_, _metzilloth_, and _metzilthaim_, appear
to have been cymbals or similar metallic instruments of percussion,
differing in shape and sound.The little bells on the vestments of the high-priest were called
_phaamon_.Small golden bells were attached to the lower part of the
robes of the high-priest in his sacred ministrations.The Jews have, at
the present day, in their synagogues small bells fastened to the rolls
of the Law containing the Pentateuch: a kind of ornamentation which is
supposed to have been in use from time immemorial.Besides the names of Hebrew instruments already given there occur
several others in the Old Testament, upon the real meaning of which
much diversity of opinion prevails._Jobel_ is by some commentators
classed with the trumpets, but it is by others believed to designate a
loud and cheerful blast of the trumpet, used on particular occasions.If _Jobel_ (from which _jubilare_ is supposed to be derived) is
identical with the name _Jubal_, the inventor of musical instruments,
it would appear that the Hebrews appreciated pre-eminently the
exhilarating power of music._Shalisbim_ is supposed to denote a
triangle._Nechiloth_, _gittith_, and _machalath_, which occur in
the headings of some psalms, are also by commentators supposed to
be musical instruments._Nechiloth_ is said to have been a flute,
and _gittith_ and _machalath_ to have been stringed instruments, and
_machol_ a kind of flute.Again, others maintain that the words denote
peculiar modes of performance or certain favourite melodies to which
the psalms were directed to be sung, or chanted.According to the
records of the Rabbins, the Hebrews in the time of David and Solomon
possessed thirty-six different musical instruments.In the Bible only
about half that number are mentioned.Most nations of antiquity ascribed the invention of their musical
instruments to their gods, or to certain superhuman beings.The Hebrews
attributed it to man; Jubal is mentioned in Genesis as “the father of
all such as handle the harp and organ” (_i.e._, performers on stringed
instruments and wind instruments).As instruments of percussion are
almost invariably in use long before people are led to construct
stringed and wind instruments it might perhaps be surmised that Jubal
was not regarded as the inventor of all the Hebrew instruments, but
rather as the first professional cultivator of instrumental music.Many musical instruments of the ancient Greeks are known to us by name;
but respecting their exact construction and capabilities there still
prevails almost as much diversity of opinion as is the case with those
of the Hebrews.It is generally believed that the Greeks derived their musical system
from the Egyptians.Pythagoras and other philosophers are said to have
studied music in Egypt.It would, however, appear that the Egyptian
influence upon Greece, as far as regards this art, has been overrated.Not only have the more perfect Egyptian instruments--such as the
larger harps, the tamboura--never been much in favour with the Greeks,
but almost all the stringed instruments which the Greeks possessed
are stated to have been originally derived from Asia.Strabo says:
“Those who regard the whole of Asia, as far as India, as consecrated
to Bacchus, point to that country as the origin of a great portion of
the present music.One author speaks of ‘striking forcibly the Asiatic
kithara,’ another calls the pipes Berecynthian and Phrygian.Some of
the instruments also have foreign names, as Nabla, Sambuka, Barbiton,
Magadis, and many others.”

We know at present little more of these instruments than that they
were in use in Greece.Of the Magadis it is even not satisfactorily
ascertained whether it was a stringed or a wind instrument.The other
three are known to have been stringed instruments.But they cannot have
been anything like such universal favourites as the lyre, because this
instrument and perhaps the _trigonon_ are almost the only stringed
instruments represented in the Greek paintings on pottery and other
monumental records.If, as might perhaps be suggested, their taste for
beauty of form induced the Greeks to represent the elegant lyre in
preference to other stringed instruments, we might at least expect to
meet with the harp; an instrument which equals if it does not surpass
the lyre in elegance of form.[Illustration]

The representation of Polyhymnia with a harp, depicted on a splendid
Greek vase now in the Munich museum, may be noted as an exceptional
instance.This valuable relic dates from the time of Alexander the
great.The instrument resembles in construction as well as in shape
the Assyrian harp, and has thirteen strings.Polyhymnia is touching
them with both hands, using the right hand for the treble and the left
for the bass.She is seated, holding the instrument in her lap.Even
the little tuning-pegs, which in number are not in accordance with
the strings, are placed on the sound-board at the upper part of the
frame, exactly as on the Assyrian harp.If then we have here the Greek
harp, it was more likely an importation from Asia than from Egypt.In
short, as far as can be ascertained, the most complete of the Greek
instruments appear to be of Asiatic origin.Especially from the nations
who inhabited Asia-minor the Greeks are stated to have adopted several
of the most popular.Thus we may read of the short and shrill-sounding
pipes of the Carians; of the Phrygian pastoral flute, consisting of
several tubes united; of the three-stringed _kithara_ of the Lydians;
and so on.The Greeks called the harp _kinyra_, and this may be the reason why in
the English translation of the Bible the _kinnor_ of the Hebrews, the
favourite instrument of king David, is rendered _harp_.[Illustration]

The Greeks had lyres of various kinds, shown in the accompanying
woodcuts, more or less differing in construction, form, and size, and
distinguished by different names; such as _lyra, ithara_, _chelys_,
_phorminx_, etc._Lyra_ appears to have implied instruments of this
class in general, and also the lyre with a body oval at the base and
held upon the lap or in the arms of the performer; while the _kithara_
had a square base and was held against the breast.These distinctions
have, however, not been satisfactorily ascertained.The _chelys_ was a
small lyre with the body made of the shell of a tortoise, or of wood in
imitation of the tortoise.The _phorminx_ was a large lyre; and, like
the _kithara_, was used at an early period singly, for accompanying
recitations.It is recorded that the _kithara_ was employed for solo
performances as early as B.C.The design on the Grecian vase at Munich (already alluded to)
represents the nine muses, of whom three are given in the engraving,
viz., Polyhymnia with the harp, and Kalliope and Erato with lyres.It
will be observed that some of the lyres engraved in the woodcuts on
page 29 are provided with a bridge, while others are without it.The
largest were held probably on or between the knees, or were attached
to the left arm by means of a band, to enable the performer to use his
hands without impediment.The strings, made of catgut or sinew, were
more usually twanged with a _plektron_ than merely with the fingers.The _plektron_ was a short stem of ivory or metal pointed at both ends.A fragment of a Greek lyre which was found in a tomb near Athens is
deposited in the British museum.The two pieces constituting its frame
are of wood.Their length is about eighteen inches, and the length
of the cross-bar at the top is about nine inches.The instrument is
unhappily in a condition too dilapidated and imperfect to be of any
essential use to the musical inquirer.The _trigonon_ consisted originally of an angular frame, to which the
strings were affixed.In the course of time a third bar was added to
resist the tension of the strings, and its triangular frame resembled
in shape the Greek delta.Subsequently it was still further improved,
the upper bar of the frame being made slightly curved, whereby the
instrument obtained greater strength and more elegance of form.The _magadis_, also called _pektis_, had twenty strings which were
tuned in octaves, and therefore produced only ten tones.It appears
to have been some sort of dulcimer, but information respecting its
construction is still wanting.There appears to have been also a
kind of bagpipe in use called _magadis_, of which nothing certain is
known.Possibly, the same name may have been applied to two different
instruments.[Illustration]

The _barbiton_ was likewise a stringed instrument of this kind.The
_sambyke_ is traditionally said to have been invented by Ibykos, B.C.The _simmikon_ had thirty-five strings, and derived its name from
its inventor, Simos, who lived about B.C.It was perhaps a kind of
dulcimer.The _nabla_ had only two strings, and probably resembled the
_nebel_ of the Hebrews, of which but little is known with certainty.The _pandoura_ is supposed to have been a kind of lute with three
strings.Several of the instruments just noticed were used in Greece,
chiefly by musicians who had immigrated from Asia; they can therefore
hardly be considered as national musical instruments of the Greeks.The
_monochord_ had (as its name implies) only a single string, and was
used in teaching singing and the laws of acoustics.[Illustration]

The flute, _aulos_, of which there were many varieties, as shown in
the woodcut p.31, was a highly popular instrument, and differed in
construction from the flutes and pipes of the ancient Egyptians.Instead of being blown through a hole at the side near the top it was
held like a flageolet, and a vibrating reed was inserted into the
mouth-piece, so that it might be more properly described as a kind
of oboe or clarionet.The Greeks were accustomed to designate by the
name of _aulos_ all wind instruments of the flute and oboe kind, some
of which were constructed like the flageolet or like our antiquated
_flûte à bec_.The single flute was called _monaulos_, and the double
one _diaulos_.A _diaulos_, which was found in a tomb at Athens, is in
the British museum.The wood of which it is made seems to be cedar,
and the tubes are fifteen inches in length.Each tube has a separate
mouth-piece and six finger-holes, five of which are at the upper side
and one is underneath.The _syrinx_, or Pandean pipe, had from three to nine tubes, but seven
was the usual number.The straight trumpet, _salpinx_, and the curved
horn, _keras_, made of brass, were used exclusively in war.The small
hand-drum, called _tympanon_, resembled in shape our tambourine, but
was covered with parchment at the back as well as at the front.The
_kymbala_ were made of metal, and resembled our small cymbals.The
_krotala_ were almost identical with our castanets, and were made of
wood or metal.THE ETRUSCANS AND ROMANS.The Romans are recorded to have derived some of their most popular
instruments originally from the Etruscans; a people which at an early
period excelled all other Italian nations in the cultivation of the
arts as well as in social refinement, and which possessed musical
instruments similar to those of the Greeks.It must, however, be
remembered that many of the vases and other specimens of art which
have been found in Etruscan tombs, and on which delineations of lyres
and other instruments occur, are supposed to be productions of Greek
artists whose works were obtained from Greece by the Etruscans, or who
were induced to settle in Etruria.The flutes of the Etruscans were not unfrequently made of ivory;
those used in religious sacrifices were of box-wood, of a species of
the lotus, of ass’ bone, bronze and silver.A bronze flute, somewhat
resembling our flageolet, has been found in a tomb; likewise a huge
trumpet of bronze.An Etruscan _cornu_ (engraved) is deposited in the
British museum, and measures about four feet in length.[Illustration]

To the Etruscans is also attributed by some the invention of the
hydraulic organ.The Greeks possessed a somewhat similar contrivance
which they called _hydraulos_, _i.e._ water-flute, and which probably
was identical with the _organum hydraulicum_ of the Romans.The
instrument ought more properly to be regarded as a pneumatic organ,
for the sound was produced by the current of air through the pipes;
the water applied serving merely to give the necessary pressure to the
bellows and to regulate their action.The pipes were probably caused
to sound by means of stops, perhaps resembling those on our organ,
which were drawn out or pushed in.The construction was evidently but
a primitive contrivance, contained in a case which could be carried by
one or two persons and which was placed on a table.The highest degree
of perfection which the hydraulic organ obtained with the ancients is
perhaps shown in a representation on a coin of the emperor Nero, in
the British museum.Only ten pipes are given to it and there is no
indication of any key board, which would probably have been shown had
it existed.The man standing at the side and holding a laurel leaf in
his hand is surmised to represent a victor in the exhibitions of the
circus or the amphitheatre.The hydraulic organ probably was played on
such occasions; and the medal containing an impression of it may have
been bestowed upon the victor.[Illustration]

During the time of the republic, and especially subsequently under
the reign of the emperors, the Romans adopted many new instruments
from Greece, Egypt, and even from western Asia; without essentially
improving any of their importations.Their most favourite stringed instrument was the lyre, of which they
had various kinds, called, according to their form and arrangement
of strings, _lyra_, _cithara_, _chelys_, _testudo_, _fidis_ (or
_fides_), and _cornu_.The name _cornu_ was given to the lyre when the
sides of the frame terminated at the top in the shape of two horns.The _barbitos_ was a kind of lyre with a large body, which gave the
instrument somewhat the shape of the Welsh _crwth_.The _psalterium_
was a kind of lyre of an oblong square shape.Like most of the Roman
lyres, it was played with a rather large plectrum.The _trigonum_ was
the same as the Greek _trigonon_, and was probably originally derived
from Egypt.It is recorded that a certain musician of the name of
Alexander Alexandrinus was so admirable a performer upon it that when
exhibiting his skill in Rome he created the greatest _furore_.Less
common, and derived from Asia, were the _sambuca_ and _nablia_, the
exact construction of which is unknown.The flute, _tibia_, was originally made of the shin bone, and had a
mouth-hole and four finger-holes.Its shape was retained even when,
at a later period, it was constructed of other substances than bone.The _tibia gingrina_ consisted of a long and thin tube of reed with
a mouth-hole at the side of one end.The _tibia obliqua_ and _tibia
vasca_ were provided with mouth-pieces affixed at a right angle to the
tube; a contrivance somewhat similar to that on our bassoon.The _tibia
longa_ was especially used in religious worship.The _tibia curva_
was curved at its broadest end.The _tibia ligula_ appears to have
resembled our flageolet.The _calamus_ was nothing more than a simple
pipe cut off the kind of reed which the ancients used as a pen for
writing.The Romans had double flutes as well as single flutes.The double flute
consisted of two tubes united, either so as to have a mouth-piece
in common or to have each a separate mouth-piece.If the tubes were
exactly alike the double flute was called _Tibiæ pares_; if they were
different from each other, _Tibiæ impares_.Little plugs, or stoppers,
were inserted into the finger-holes to regulate the order of intervals.The _tibia_ was made in various shapes.The _tibia dextra_ was usually
constructed of the upper and thinner part of a reed; and the _tibia
sinistra_, of the lower and broader part.The performers used also the
_capistrum_,--a bandage round the cheeks identical with the _phorbeia_
of the Greeks.The British museum contains a mosaic figure of a Roman girl playing
the _tibia_, which is stated to have been disinterred in the year 1823
on the Via Appia.Here the _holmos_ or mouth-piece, somewhat resembling
the reed of our oboe, is distinctly shown.The finger-holes, probably
four, are not indicated, although they undoubtedly existed on the
instrument.[Illustration]

Furthermore, the Romans had two kinds of Pandean pipes, viz.the
_syrinx_ and the _fistula_.The bagpipe, _tibia utricularis_, is said
to have been a favourite instrument of the emperor Nero.[Illustration]

The _cornu_ was a large horn of bronze, curved.The performer held
it under his arm with the broad end upwards over his shoulder.It is
represented in the engraving, with the _tuba_ and the _lituus_.The _tuba_ was a straight trumpet.Both the _cornu_ and the _tuba_
were employed in war to convey signals.The same was the case with the
_buccina_,--originally perhaps a conch shell, and afterwards a simple
horn of an animal,--and the _lituus_, which was bent at the broad end
but otherwise straight.The _tympanum_ resembled the tambourine and was
beaten like the latter with the hands.Among the Roman instruments
of percussion the _scabillum_, which consisted of two plates combined
by means of a sort of hinge, deserves to be noticed; it was fastened
under the foot and trodden in time, to produce certain rhythmical
effects in musical performances.The _cymbalum_ consisted of two metal
plates similar to our cymbals.The _crotala_ and the _crusmata_ were
kinds of castanets, the former being oblong and of a larger size than
the latter.The Romans had also a _triangulum_, which resembled the
triangle occasionally used in our orchestra.The _sistrum_ they derived
from Egypt with the introduction of the worship of Isis.Metal bells,
arranged according to a regular order of intervals and placed in a
frame, were called _tintinnabula_.The _crepitaculum_ appears to have
been a somewhat similar contrivance on a hoop with a handle.Through the Greeks and Romans we have the first well-authenticated
proof of musical instruments having been introduced into Europe from
Asia.The Romans in their conquests undoubtedly made their musical
instruments known, to some extent, also in western Europe.But the
Greeks and Romans are not the only nations which introduced eastern
instruments into Europe.The Phœnicians at an early period colonized
Sardinia, and traces of them are still to be found on that island.Among these is a peculiarly constructed double-pipe, called _lionedda_
or _launedda_.Again, at a much later period the Arabs introduced
several of their instruments into Spain, from which country they became
known in France, Germany, and England.Also the crusaders, during the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, may have helped to familiarize the
western European nations with instruments of the east.CHAPTER V.


THE CHINESE.Allowing for any exaggeration as to chronology, natural to the lively
imagination of Asiatics, there is no reason to doubt that the Chinese
possessed long before our Christian era musical instruments to which
they attribute a fabulously high antiquity.There is an ancient
tradition, according to which they obtained their musical scale from
a miraculous bird, called foung-hoang, which appears to have been a
sort of phœnix.When Confucius, who lived about B.C.500, happened to
hear on a certain occasion some Chinese music, he became so greatly
enraptured that he could not take any food for three months afterwards.The sounds which produced this effect were those of Kouei, the Orpheus
of the Chinese, whose performance on the _king_--a kind of harmonicon
constructed of slabs of sonorous stone--would draw wild animals around
him and make them subservient to his will.As regards the invention of
musical instruments the Chinese have other traditions.In one of these
we are told that the origin of some of their most popular instruments
dates from the period when China was under the dominion of heavenly
spirits, called Ki.Another assigns the invention of several stringed
instruments to the great Fohi who was the founder of the empire and
who lived about B.C.3000, which was long after the dominion of the
Ki, or spirits.Again, another tradition holds that the most important
instruments and systematic arrangements of sounds are an invention of
Niuva, a supernatural female, who lived at the time of Fohi.[Illustration]

According to their records, the Chinese possessed their much-esteemed
_king_ 2200 years before our Christian era, and employed it for
accompanying songs of praise.During religious observances at the solemn moment when the _king_ was
sounded sticks of incense were burnt.It was likewise played before
the emperor early in the morning when he awoke.The Chinese have long
since constructed various kinds of the _king_, one of which is here
engraved, by using different species of stones.Their most famous stone
selected for this purpose is called _yu_.It is not only very sonorous
but also beautiful in appearance.The _yu_ is found in mountain streams
and crevices of rocks.The largest specimens found measure from two to
three feet in diameter, but of this size examples rarely occur.The
_yu_ is very hard and heavy.Some European mineralogists, to whom the
missionaries transmitted specimens for examination, pronounce it to be
a species of agate.It is found of different colours, and the Chinese
appear to have preferred in different centuries particular colours for
the _king_.The Chinese consider the _yu_ especially valuable for musical purposes,
because it always retains exactly the same pitch.All other musical
instruments, they say, are in this respect doubtful; but the tone of
the _yu_ is neither influenced by cold nor heat, nor by humidity, nor
dryness.The stones used for the _king_ have been cut from time to time in
various grotesque shapes.Some represent animals: as, for instance, a
bat with outstretched wings; or two fishes placed side by side: others
are in the shape of an ancient Chinese bell.The angular shape shown
in the engraving appears to be the oldest and is still retained in the
ornamented stones of the _pien-king_, which is a more modern instrument
than the _king_.The tones of the _pien-king_ are attuned according
to the Chinese intervals called _lu_, of which there are twelve in
the compass of an octave.The same is the case with the other Chinese
instruments of this class.The pitch of
the _soung-king_, for instance, is four intervals lower than that of
the _pien-king_.Sonorous stones have always been used by the Chinese also singly, as
rhythmical instruments.Such a single stone is called _tse-king_.Probably certain curious relics belonging to a temple in Peking,
erected for the worship of Confucius, serve a similar purpose.In one
of the outbuildings or the temple are ten sonorous stones, shaped like
drums, which are asserted to have been cut about three thousand years
ago.The primitive Chinese characters engraven upon them are nearly
obliterated.The ancient Chinese had several kinds of bells, frequently arranged in
sets so as to constitute a musical scale.The Chinese name for the bell
is _tchung_.At an early period they had a somewhat square-shaped bell
called _té-tchung_.Like other ancient Chinese bells it was made of
copper alloyed with tin, the proportion being one pound of tin to six
of copper.The _té-tchung_, which is also known by the name of _piao_,
was principally used to indicate the time and divisions in musical
performances.It had a fixed pitch of sound, and several of these bells
attuned to a certain order of intervals were not unfrequently ranged
in a regular succession, thus forming a musical instrument which was
called _pien-tchung_.The musical scale of the sixteen bells which
the _pien-tchung_ contained was the same as that of the _king_ before
mentioned.[Illustration]

The _hiuen-tchung_ was, according to popular tradition, included with
the antique instruments at the time of Confucius, and came into popular
use during the Han dynasty (from B.C.It was of
a peculiar oval shape and had nearly the same quaint ornamentation
as the _té-tchung_; this consisted of symbolical figures, in four
divisions, each containing nine mammals.Every figure had a deep meaning referring to the seasons and to the
mysteries of the Buddhist religion.The largest _hiuen-tchung_ was
about twenty inches in length; and, like the _té-tchung_, was sounded
by means of a small wooden mallet with an oval knob.None of the bells
of this description had a clapper.It would, however, appear that the
Chinese had at an early period some kind of bell provided with a wooden
tongue: this was used for military purposes as well as for calling the
people together when an imperial messenger promulgated his sovereign’s
commands.An expression of Confucius is recorded to the effect that
he wished to be “A wooden-tongued bell of Heaven,” _i.e._ a herald of
heaven to proclaim the divine purposes to the multitude.[Illustration]

The _fang-hiang_ was a kind of wood-harmonicon.It contained sixteen
wooden slabs of an oblong square shape, suspended in a wooden frame
elegantly decorated.The slabs were arranged in two tiers, one above
the other, and were all of equal length and breadth but differed in
thickness.The _tchoung-tou_ consisted of twelve slips of bamboo, and
was used for beating time and for rhythmical purposes.The slips being
banded together at one end could be expanded somewhat like a fan.The
Chinese state that they used the _tchoung-tou_ for writing upon before
they invented paper.The _ou_, of which we give a woodcut, likewise an ancient Chinese
instrument of percussion and still in use, is made of wood in the shape
of a crouching tiger.It is hollow, and along its back are about twenty
small pieces of metal, pointed, and in appearance not unlike the teeth
of a saw.The performer strikes them with a sort of plectrum resembling
a brush, or with a small stick called _tchen_.Occasionally the _ou_ is
made with pieces of metal shaped like reeds.[Illustration]

The ancient _ou_ was constructed with only six tones which were
attuned thus--_f_, _g_, _a_, _c_, _d_, _f_.The instrument appears
to have become deteriorated in the course of time; for, although
it has gradually acquired as many as twenty-seven pieces of metal,
it evidently serves at the present day more for the production of
rhythmical noise than for the execution of any melody.The modern _ou_
is made of a species of wood called _kieou_ or _tsieou_: and the tiger
rests generally on a hollow wooden pedestal about three feet six inches
long, which serves as a sound-board.[Illustration]

The _tchou_, likewise an instrument of percussion, was made of the
wood of a tree called _kieou-mou_, the stem of which resembles that of
the pine and whose foliage is much like that of the cypress.It was
constructed of boards about three-quarters of an inch in thickness.In
the middle of one of the sides was an aperture into which the hand was
passed for the purpose of holding the handle of a wooden hammer, the
end of which entered into a hole situated in the bottom of the _tchou_.The handle was kept in its place by means of a wooden pin, on which it
moved right and left when the instrument was struck with a hammer.The
Chinese ascribe to the _tchou_ a very high antiquity, as they almost
invariably do with any of their inventions when the date of its origin
is unknown to them.The _po-fou_ was a drum, about one foot four inches in length, and
seven inches in diameter.It had a parchment at each end, which was
prepared in a peculiar way by being boiled in water.The _po-fou_ used
to be partly filled with a preparation made from the husk of rice, in
order to mellow the sound.The Chinese name for the drum is _kou_.[Illustration]

The _kin-kou_ (engraved), a large drum fixed on a pedestal which raises
it above six feet from the ground, is embellished with symbolical
designs.A similar drum on which natural phenomena are depicted is
called _lei-kou_; and another of the kind, with figures of certain
birds and beasts which are regarded as symbols of long life, is called
_ling-kou_, and also _lou-kou_.The flutes, _ty_, _yo_, and _tché_ were generally made of bamboo.The
_koan-tsee_ was a Pandean pipe containing twelve tubes of bamboo.The _siao_, likewise a Pandean pipe, contained sixteen tubes.The
_pai-siao_ differed from the _siao_ inasmuch as the tubes were inserted
into an oddly-shaped case highly ornamented with grotesque designs and
silken appendages.[Illustration]

The Chinese are known to have constructed at an early period a curious
wind-instrument, called _hiuen_.It was made of baked clay and had five
finger-holes, three of which were placed on one side and two on the
opposite side, as in the cut.Its tones were in conformity with the
pentatonic scale.The reader unacquainted with the pentatonic scale may
ascertain its character by playing on the pianoforte the scale of C
major with the omission of _f_ and _b_ (the _fourth_ and _seventh_); or
by striking the black keys in regular succession from _f_-sharp to the
next _f_-sharp above or below.Another curious wind-instrument of high antiquity, the _cheng_,
(engraved, p.Formerly it had either 13, 19, or
24 tubes, placed in a calabash; and a long curved tube served as a
mouth-piece.In olden time it was called _yu_.The ancient stringed instruments, the _kin_ and _chê_, were of the
dulcimer kind: they are still in use, and specimens of them are in the
South Kensington museum.The Buddhists introduced from Thibet into China their god of music,
who is represented as a rather jovial-looking man with a moustache
and an imperial, playing the _pepa_, a kind of lute with four silken
strings.Perhaps some interesting information respecting the ancient
Chinese musical instruments may be gathered from the famous ruins of
the Buddhist temples _Ongcor-Wat_ and _Ongcor-Thôm_, in Cambodia.These splendid ruins are supposed to be above two thousand years old:
and, at any rate, the circumstance of their age not being known to the
Cambodians suggests a high antiquity.On the bas-reliefs with which the
temples were enriched are figured musical instruments, which European
travellers describe as “flutes, organs, trumpets, and drums, resembling
those of the Chinese.” Faithful sketches of these representations
might, very likely, afford valuable hints to the student of musical
history.[Illustration]

In the Brahmin mythology of the Hindus the god Nareda is the inventor
of the _vina_, the principal national instrument of Hindustan.Saraswati, the consort of Brahma, may be regarded as the Minerva of
the Hindus.She is the goddess of music as well as of speech; to her
is attributed the invention of the systematic arrangement of the
sounds into a musical scale.She is represented seated on a peacock
and playing on a stringed instrument of the lute kind.Brahma himself
we find depicted as a vigorous man with four handsome heads, beating
with his hands upon a small drum; and Vishnu, in his incarnation as
Krishna, is represented as a beautiful youth playing upon a flute.The
Hindus construct a peculiar kind of flute, which they consider as the
favourite instrument of Krishna.They have also the divinity Ganesa,
the god of Wisdom, who is represented as a man with the head of an
elephant, holding a _tamboura_ in his hands.It is a suggestive fact that we find among several nations in different
parts of the world an ancient tradition, according to which their most
popular stringed instrument was originally derived from the water.In Hindu mythology the god Nareda invented the _vina_--the principal
national instrument of Hindustan--which has also the name _cach’-hapi_,
signifying a tortoise (_testudo_).Moreover, _nara_ denotes in Sanskrit
water, and _narada_, or _nareda_, the giver of water.Like Nareda,
Nereus and his fifty daughters, the Nereides, were much renowned for
their musical accomplishments; and Hermes (it will be remembered) made
his lyre, the _chelys_, of a tortoise-shell.The Scandinavian god Odin,
the originator of magic songs, is mentioned as the ruler of the sea,
and as such he had the name of _Nikarr_.In the depth of the sea he
played the harp with his subordinate spirits, who occasionally came up
to the surface of the water to teach some favoured human being their
wonderful instrument.Wäinämöinen, the divine player on the Finnish
_kantele_ (according to the Kalewala, the old national epic of the
Finns) constructed his instrument of fish-bones.The frame he made out
of the bones of the pike; and the teeth of the pike he used for the
tuning-pegs.Jacob Grimm in his work on German mythology points out an old
tradition, preserved in Swedish and Scotch national ballads, of a
skilful harper who constructs his instrument out of the bones of a
young girl drowned by a wicked woman.Her fingers he uses for the
tuning screws, and her golden hair for the strings.The harper plays,
and his music kills the murderess.A similar story is told in the old
Icelandic national songs; and the same tradition has been preserved in
the Faroe islands, as well as in Norway and Denmark.May not the agreeable impression produced by the rhythmical flow of
the waves and the soothing murmur of running water have led various
nations, independently of each other, to the widespread conception that
they obtained their favourite instrument of music from the water?Or is
the notion traceable to a common source dating from a pre-historic age,
perhaps from the early period when the Aryan race is surmised to have
diffused its lore through various countries?Or did it originate in the
old belief that the world, with all its charms and delights, arose from
a chaos in which water constituted the predominant element?Howbeit, Nareda, the giver of water, was evidently also the ruler of
the clouds; and Odin had his throne in the skies.Indeed, many of the
musical water-spirits appear to have been originally considered as rain
deities.Their music may therefore be regarded as derived from the
clouds rather than from the sea.In short, the traditions respecting
spirits and water are not in contradiction to the opinion of the
ancient Hindus that music is of heavenly origin, but rather tend to
support it.The earliest musical instruments of the Hindus on record have, almost
all of them, remained in popular use until the present day scarcely
altered.Besides these, the Hindus possess several Arabic and Persian
instruments which are of comparatively modern date in Hindustan:
evidently having been introduced into that country scarcely a thousand
years ago, at the time of the Mahomedan irruption.There is a treatise
on music extant, written in Sanskrit, which contains a description of
the ancient instruments.Its title is _Sângita râthnakara_.If, as
may be hoped, it be translated by a Sanskrit scholar who is at the
same time a good musician, we shall probably be enabled to ascertain
more exactly which of the Hindu instruments of the present day are of
comparatively modern origin.The _vina_ is undoubtedly of high antiquity.It has seven wire strings,
and movable frets which are generally fastened with wax.Two hollowed
gourds, often tastefully ornamented, are affixed to it for the purpose
of increasing the sonorousness.There are several kinds of the _vina_
in different districts; but that represented in the illustration
is regarded as the oldest.The performer shown is Jeewan Shah, a
celebrated virtuoso on the _vina_, who lived about a hundred years ago.The Hindus divided their musical scale into several intervals smaller
than our modern semitones.They adopted twenty-two intervals called
_sruti_ in the compass of an octave, which may therefore be compared
to our chromatic intervals.As the frets of the _vina_ are movable the
performer can easily regulate them according to the scale, or mode,
which he requires for his music.[Illustration]

The harp, _chang_, has become almost obsolete.If some Hindu drawings
of it can be relied upon, it had at an early time a triangular frame
and was in construction as well as in shape and size almost identical
with the Assyrian harp.The Hindus claim to have invented the violin bow.They maintain that
the _ravanastron_, one of their old instruments played with the bow,
was invented about five thousand years ago by Ravanon, a mighty king
of Ceylon.However this may be there is a great probability that the
fiddle-bow originated in Hindustan; because Sanskrit scholars inform
us that there are names for it in works which cannot be less than
from 1500 to 2000 years old.The non-occurrence of any instrument
played with a bow on the monuments of the nations of antiquity is
by no means so sure a proof as has generally been supposed, that the
bow was unknown.The fiddle in its primitive condition must have been
a poor contrivance.It probably was despised by players who could
produce better tones with greater facility by twanging the strings
with their fingers, or with a plectrum.Thus it may have remained
through many centuries without experiencing any material improvement.It must also be borne in mind that the monuments transmitted to us
chiefly represent historical events, religious ceremonies, and royal
entertainments.On such occasions instruments of a certain kind only
were used, and these we find represented; while others, which may
have been even more common, never occur.In two thousand years’ time
people will possibly maintain that some highly perfected instrument
popular with them was entirely unknown to us, because it is at present
in so primitive a condition that no one hardly notices it.If the
_ravanastron_ was an importation of the Mahomedans it would most likely
bear some resemblance to the Arabian and Persian instruments, and it
would be found rather in the hands of the higher classes in the towns;
whereas it is principally met with among the lower order of people, in
isolated and mountainous districts.It is further remarkable that the
most simple kind of _ravanastron_ is almost identical with the Chinese
fiddle called _ur-heen_.This species has only two strings, and its
body consists of a small block of wood, hollowed out and covered with
the skin of a serpent.The _ur-heen_ has not been mentioned among the
most ancient instruments of the Chinese, since there is no evidence of
its having been known in China before the introduction of the Buddhist
religion into that country.From indications, which to point out would
lead too far here, it would appear that several instruments found
in China originated in Hindustan.They seem to have been gradually
diffused from Hindustan and Thibet, more or less altered in the course
of time, through the east as far as Japan.Another curious Hindu instrument, probably of very high antiquity,
is the _poongi_, also called _toumrie_ and _magoudi_.It consists
of a gourd or of the Cuddos nut, hollowed, into which two pipes are
inserted.The _poongi_ therefore somewhat resembles in appearance a
bagpipe.It is generally used by the _Sampuris_ or snake charmers,
who play upon it when they exhibit the antics of the cobra.The name
_magoudi_, given in certain districts to this instrument, rather
tends to corroborate the opinion of some musical historians that the
_magadis_ of the ancient Greeks was a sort of double-pipe, or bagpipe.Many instruments of Hindustan are known by different names in different
districts; and, besides, there are varieties of them.On the whole, the
Hindus possess about fifty instruments.To describe them properly would
fill a volume.Some, which are in the Kensington museum, will be found
noticed in the large catalogue of that collection.THE PERSIANS AND ARABS.Of the musical instruments of the ancient Persians, before the
Christian era, scarcely anything is known.It may be surmised that they
closely resembled those of the Assyrians, and probably also those of
the Hebrews.[Illustration]

The harp, _chang_, in olden time a favourite instrument of the
Persians, has gradually fallen into desuetude.The illustration of a
small harp given in the woodcut has been sketched from the celebrated
sculptures, perhaps of the sixth century, which exist on a stupendous
rock, called Tackt-i-Bostan, in the vicinity of the town of Kermanshah.These sculptures are said to have been executed during the lifetime
of the Persian monarch Khosroo Purviz.They form the ornaments of
two lofty arches, and consist of representations of field sports
and aquatic amusements.In one of the boats is seated a man in an
ornamental dress, with a halo round his head, who is receiving an
arrow from one of his attendants; while a female, who is sitting
near him, plays on a Trigonon.Towards the top of the bas-relief
is represented a stage, on which are performers on small straight
trumpets and little hand drums; six harpers; and four other musicians,
apparently females,--the first of whom plays a flute; the second,
a sort of pandean pipe; the third, an instrument which is too much
defaced to be recognizable; and the fourth, a bagpipe.Two harps of a
peculiar shape were copied by Sir Gore Ousely from Persian manuscripts
about four hundred years old resembling, in the principle on which they
are constructed, all other oriental harps.There existed evidently
various kinds of the _chang_.It may be remarked here that the
instrument _tschenk_ (or _chang_) in use at the present day in Persia,
is more like a dulcimer than a harp.The Arabs adopted the harp from
the Persians, and called it _junk_.An interesting representation of a
Turkish woman playing the harp (p.53) sketched from life by Melchior
Lorich in the seventeenth century, probably exhibits an old Persian
_chang_; for the Turks derived their music principally from Persia.Here we have an introduction into Europe of the oriental frame without
a front pillar.[Illustration]

The Persians appear to have adopted, at an early period, smaller
musical intervals than semitones.When the Arabs conquered Persia (A.D.641) the Persians had already attained a higher degree of civilisation
than their conquerors.The latter found in Persia the cultivation of
music considerably in advance of their own, and the musical instruments
superior also.They soon adopted the Persian instruments, and there
can be no doubt that the musical system exhibited by the earliest
Arab writers whose works on the theory of music have been preserved
was based upon an older system of the Persians.In these works the
octave is divided in seventeen _one-third-tones_--intervals which are
still made use of in the east.Some of the Arabian instruments are
constructed so as to enable the performer to produce the intervals
with exactness.The frets on the lute and tamboura, for instance, are
regulated with a view to this object.[Illustration]

The Arabs had to some extent become acquainted with many of the
Persian instruments before the time of their conquest of Persia.An
Arab musician of the name of Nadr Ben el-Hares Ben Kelde is recorded
as having been sent to the Persian king Khosroo Purviz, in the sixth
century, for the purpose of learning Persian singing and performing
on the lute.Through him, it is said, the lute was brought to Mekka.Saib Chatir, the son of a Persian, is spoken of as the first performer
on the lute in Medina, A.D.682; and of an Arab lutist, Ebn Soreidsch
from Mekka, A.D.683, it is especially mentioned that he played in the
Persian style; evidently the superior one.The lute, _el-oud_, had
before the tenth century only four strings, or four pairs producing
four tones, each tone having two strings tuned in unison.About the
tenth century a string for a fifth tone was added.The strings were
made of silk neatly twisted.The neck of the instrument was provided
with frets of string, which were carefully regulated according to
the system of seventeen intervals in the compass of an octave before
mentioned.Other favourite stringed instruments were the _tamboura_,
a kind of lute with a long neck, and the _kanoon_, a kind of dulcimer
strung with lamb’s gut strings (generally three in unison for each
tone) and played upon with two little plectra which the performer had
fastened to his fingers.The _kanoon_ is likewise still in use in
countries inhabited by Mahomedans.The engraving, taken from a Persian
painting at Teheran, represents an old Persian _santir_, the prototype
of our dulcimer, mounted with wire strings and played upon with two
slightly curved sticks.[Illustration]

Al-Farabi, one of the earliest Arabian musical theorists known, who
lived in the beginning of the tenth century, does not allude to the
fiddle-bow.This is noteworthy inasmuch as it seems in some measure
to support the opinion maintained by some historians that the bow
originated in England or Wales.Unfortunately we possess no exact
descriptions of the Persian and Arabian instruments between the tenth
and fourteenth centuries, otherwise we should probably have earlier
accounts of some instrument of the violin kind in Persia.Ash-shakandi,
who lived in Spain about A.D.1200, mentions the _rebab_, which may
have been in use for centuries without having been thought worthy of
notice on account of its rudeness.Persian writers of the fourteenth
century speak of two instruments of the violin class, viz., the _rebab_
and the _kemangeh_.As regards the _kemangeh_, the Arabs themselves
assert that they obtained it from Persia, and their statement appears
all the more worthy of belief from the fact that both names, _rebab_
and _kemangeh_, are originally Persian.We engrave the _rebab_ from an
example at South Kensington.[Illustration]

The _nay_, a flute, and the _surnay_, a species of oboe, are still
popular in the east.The Arabs must have been indefatigable constructors of musical
instruments.Kiesewetter gives a list of above two hundred names of
Arabian instruments, and this does not include many known to us through
Spanish historians.A careful investigation of the musical instruments
of the Arabs during their sojourn in Spain is particularly interesting
to the student of mediæval music, inasmuch as it reveals the eastern
origin of many instruments which are generally regarded as European
inventions.Introduced into Spain by the Saracens and the Moors they
were gradually diffused towards northern Europe.The English, for
instance, adopted not only the Moorish dance (morrice dance) but also
the _kuitra_ (gittern), the _el-oud_ (lute), the _rebab_ (rebec), the
_nakkarah_ (naker), and several others.In an old Cornish sacred drama,
supposed to date from the fourteenth century, we have in an enumeration
of musical instruments the _nakrys_, designating “kettle-drums.” It
must be remembered that the Cornish language, which has now become
obsolete, was nearly akin to the Welsh.Indeed, names of musical
instruments derived from the Moors in Spain occur in almost every
European language.Not a few fanciful stories are traditionally preserved among the Arabs
testifying to the wonderful effects they ascribed to the power of their
instrumental performances.Al-Farabi had
acquired his proficiency in Spain, in one of the schools at Cordova
which flourished as early as towards the end of the ninth century: and
his reputation became so great that ultimately it extended to Asia.The mighty caliph of Bagdad himself desired to hear the celebrated
musician, and sent messengers to Spain with instructions to offer rich
presents to him and to convey him to the court.But Al-Farabi feared
that if he went he should be retained in Asia, and should never again
see the home to which he felt deeply attached.At last he resolved
to disguise himself, and ventured to undertake the journey which
promised him a rich harvest.Dressed in a mean costume, he made his
appearance at the court just at the time when the caliph was being
entertained with his daily concert.Al-Farabi, unknown to everyone, was
permitted to exhibit his skill on the lute.Scarcer had he commenced
his performance in a certain musical mode when he set all his audience
laughing aloud, notwithstanding the efforts of the courtiers to
suppress so unbecoming an exhibition of mirth in the royal presence.In
truth, even the caliph himself was compelled to burst out into a fit
of laughter.Presently the performer changed to another mode, and the
effect was that immediately all his hearers began to sigh, and soon
tears of sadness replaced the previous tears of mirth.Again he played
in another mode, which excited his audience to such a rage that they
would have fought each other if he, seeing the danger, had not directly
gone over to an appeasing mode.After this wonderful exhibition of his
skill Al-Farabi concluded in a mode which had the effect of making
his listeners fall into a profound sleep, during which he took his
departure.It will be seen that this incident is almost identical with one
recorded as having happened about twelve hundred years earlier at the
court of Alexander the great, and which forms the subject of Dryden’s
“Alexander’s Feast.” The distinguished flutist Timotheus successively
aroused and subdued different passions by changing the musical modes
during his performance, exactly in the same way as did Al-Farabi.If the preserved antiquities of the American Indians, dating from a
period anterior to our discovery of the western hemisphere, possess
an extraordinary interest because they afford trustworthy evidence
of the degree of progress which the aborigines had attained in the
cultivation of the arts and in their social condition before they came
in contact with Europeans, it must be admitted that the ancient musical
instruments of the American Indians are also worthy of examination.Several of them are constructed in a manner which, in some degree,
reveals the characteristics of the musical system prevalent among the
people who used the instruments.And although most of these interesting
relics, which have been obtained from tombs and other hiding-places,
may not be of great antiquity, it has been satisfactorily ascertained
that they are genuine contrivances of the Indians before they were
influenced by European civilization.Some account of these relics is therefore likely to prove of interest
also to the ethnologist, especially as several facts may perhaps be
found of assistance in elucidating the still unsolved problem as to the
probable original connection of the American with Asiatic races.Among the instruments of the Aztecs in Mexico and of the Peruvians
none have been found so frequently, and have been preserved in their
former condition so unaltered, as pipes and flutes.They are generally
made of pottery or of bone, substances which are unsuitable for the
construction of most other instruments, but which are remarkably
well qualified to withstand the decaying influence of time.There
is, therefore, no reason to conclude from the frequent occurrence of
such instruments that they were more common than other kinds of which
specimens have rarely been discovered.[Illustration]

The Mexicans possessed a small whistle formed of baked clay, a
considerable number of which have been found.Some specimens (of which
we give engravings) are singularly grotesque in shape, representing
caricatures of the human face and figure, birds, beasts, and flowers.Some were provided at the top with a finger-hole which, when closed,
altered the pitch of the sound, so that two different tones were
producible on the instrument.Others had a little ball of baked clay
lying loose inside the air-chamber.When the instrument was blown the
current of air set the ball in a vibrating motion, thereby causing a
shrill and whirring sound.A similar contrivance is sometimes made
use of by Englishmen for conveying signals.The Mexican whistle most
likely served principally the same purpose, but it may possibly have
been used also in musical entertainments.In the Russian horn band
each musician is restricted to a single tone; and similar combinations
of performers--only, of course, much more rude--have been witnessed by
travellers among some tribes in Africa and America.[Illustration]

Rather more complete than the above specimens are some of the whistles
and small pipes which have been found in graves of the Indians of
Chiriqui in central America.The pipe or whistle which is represented
in the accompanying engraving appears, to judge from the somewhat
obscure description transmitted to us, to possess about half a dozen
tones.It is of pottery, painted in red and black on a cream-
ground, and in length about five inches.Among the instruments of this
kind from central America the most complete have four finger-holes.By means of three the following four sounds (including the sound
which is produced when none of the holes are closed) can be emitted:
[Illustration] the fourth finger-hole, when closed, has the effect of
lowering the pitch a semitone.By a particular process two or three
lower notes are obtainable.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The pipe of the Aztecs, which is called by the Mexican Spaniards
_pito_, somewhat resembled our flageolet: the material was a reddish
pottery, and it was provided with four finger-holes.Although among
about half a dozen specimens which the writer has examined some are
considerably larger than others they all have, singularly enough, the
same pitch of sound.The smallest is about six inches in length, and
the largest about nine inches.Several _pitos_ have been found in a
remarkably well-preserved condition.They are easy to blow, and their
order of intervals is in conformity with the pentatonic scale, thus:
[Illustration] The usual shape of the _pito_ is that here represented;
showing the upper side of one pipe, and a side view of another.A
specimen of a less common shape, also engraved, is in the British
museum.Indications suggestive of the popular estimation in which the
flute (or perhaps, more strictly speaking, the pipe) was held by the
Aztecs are not wanting.It was played in religious observances and
we find it referred to allegorically in orations delivered on solemn
occasions.For instance, at the religious festival which was held in
honour of Tezcatlepoca--a divinity depicted as a handsome youth, and
considered second only to the supreme being--a young man was sacrificed
who, in preparation for the ceremony, had been instructed in the art of
playing the flute.Twenty days before his death four young girls, named
after the principal goddesses, were given to him as companions; and
when the hour arrived in which he was to be sacrificed he observed the
established symbolical rite of breaking a flute on each of the steps,
as he ascended the temple.Again, at the public ceremonies which took place on the accession of
a prince to the throne the new monarch addressed a prayer to the god,
in which occurred the following allegorical expression:--“I am thy
flute; reveal to me thy will; breathe into me thy breath like into a
flute, as thou hast done to my predecessors on the throne.As thou
hast opened their eyes, their ears, and their mouth to utter what is
good, so likewise do to me.I resign myself entirely to thy guidance.”
Similar sentences occur in the orations addressed to the monarch.In
reading them one can hardly fail to be reminded of Hamlet’s reflections
addressed to Guildenstern, when the servile courtier expresses his
inability to “govern the ventages” of the pipe and to make the
instrument “discourse most eloquent music,” which the prince bids him
to do.M. de Castelnau in his “Expédition dans l’Amérique” gives among the
illustrations of objects discovered in ancient Peruvian tombs a flute
made of a human bone.It has four finger-holes at its upper surface
and appears to have been blown into at one end.Two bone-flutes, in
appearance similar to the engraving given by M. de Castelnau, which
have been disinterred at Truxillo are deposited in the British museum.They are about six inches in length, and each is provided with five
finger-holes.One of these has all the holes at its upper side, and one
of the holes is considerably smaller than the rest.The specimen which
we engrave (p.64) is ornamented with some simple designs in black.The other has four holes at its upper side and one underneath, the
latter being placed near to the end at which the instrument evidently
was blown.In the aperture of this end some remains of a hardened
paste, or resinous substance, are still preserved.This substance
probably was inserted for the purpose of narrowing the end of the
tube, in order to facilitate the producing of the sounds.The same
contrivance is still resorted to in the construction of the bone-flutes
by some Indian tribes in Guiana.The bones of slain enemies appear
to have been considered especially appropriate for such flutes.The
Araucanians, having killed a prisoner, made flutes of his bones, and
danced and “thundered out their dreadful war-songs, accompanied by the
mournful sounds of these horrid instruments.” Alonso de Ovalle says
of the Indians in Chili: “Their flutes, which they play upon in their
dances, are made of the bones of the Spaniards and other enemies whom
they have overcome in war.This they do by way of triumph and glory for
their victory.They make them likewise of bones of animals; but the
warriors dance only to the flutes made of their enemies.” The Mexicans
and Peruvians obviously possessed a great variety of pipes and flutes,
some of which are still in use among certain Indian tribes.Those which
were found in the famous ruins at Palenque are deposited in the museum
in Mexico.They are:--The _cuyvi_, a pipe on which only five tones
were producible; the _huayllaca_, a sort of flageolet; the _pincullu_,
a flute; and the _chayna_, which is described as “a flute whose
lugubrious and melancholy tones filled the heart with indescribable
sadness, and brought involuntary tears into the eyes.” It was perhaps a
kind of oboe.[Illustration]

The Peruvians had the syrinx, which they called _huayra-puhura_.Some
clue to the proper meaning of this name may perhaps be gathered from
the word _huayra_, which signifies “air.” The _huayra-puhura_ was made
of cane, and also of stone.Sometimes an embroidery of needle-work was
attached to it as an ornament.One specimen which has been disinterred
is adorned with twelve figures precisely resembling Maltese crosses.The cross is a figure which may readily be supposed to suggest itself
very naturally; and it is therefore not so surprising, as it may appear
at a first glance, that the American Indians used it not unfrequently
in designs and sculptures before they came in contact with Christians.[Illustration]

The British museum possesses a _huayra-puhura_ consisting of fourteen
reed pipes of a brownish colour, tied together in two rows by means
of thread, so as to form a double set of seven reeds.Both sets are
almost exactly of the same dimensions and are placed side by side.The
shortest of these reeds measure three inches, and the longest six and
a half.In one set they are open at the bottom, and in the other they
are closed.The reader is probably
aware that the closing of a pipe at the end raises its pitch an octave.Thus, in our organ, the so-called stopped diapason, a set of closed
pipes, requires tubes of only half the length of those which constitute
the open diapason, although both these stops produce tones in the same
pitch; the only difference between them being the quality of sound,
which in the former is less bright than in the latter.The tones yielded by the _huayra-puhura_ in question are as follows:
[Illustration] The highest octave is indistinct, owing to some injury
done to the shortest tubes; but sufficient evidence remains to show
that the intervals were purposely arranged according to the pentatonic
scale.This interesting relic was brought to light from a tomb at Arica.[Illustration]

Another _huayra-puhura_, likewise still yielding sounds, was discovered
placed over a corpse in a Peruvian tomb, and was procured by the French
general, Paroissien.This instrument is made of a greenish stone which
is a species of talc, and contains eight pipes.In the Berlin museum
may be seen a good plaster cast taken from this curious relic.The
height is 5⅜ inches, and its width 6¼ inches.Four of the tubes
have small lateral finger-holes which, when closed, lower the pitch a
semitone.These holes are on the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh
pipe, as shown in the engraving.When the holes are open, the tones
are: [Illustration] and when they are closed: [Illustration] The other
tubes have unalterable tones.The following notation exhibits all the
tones producible on the instrument:

[Illustration]

The musician is likely to speculate what could have induced the
Peruvians to adopt so strange a series of intervals: it seems rather
arbitrary than premeditated.[Illustration]

If (and this seems not to be improbable) the Peruvians considered those
tones which are produced by closing the lateral holes as additional
intervals only, a variety of scales or kinds of _modes_ may have been
contrived by the admission of one or other of these tones among the
essential ones.If we may conjecture from some remarks of Garcilasso
de la Vega, and other historians, the Peruvians appear to have used
different orders of intervals for different kinds of tunes, in a way
similar to what we find to be the case with certain Asiatic nations.We
are told for instance “Each poem, or song, had its appropriate tune,
and they could not put two different songs to one tune; and this was
why the enamoured gallant, making music at night on his flute, with the
tune which belonged to it, told the lady and all the world the joy or
sorrow of his soul, the favour or ill-will which he possessed; so that
it might be said that he spoke by the flute.” Thus also the Hindus have
certain tunes for certain seasons and fixed occasions, and likewise a
number of different modes or scales used for particular kinds of songs.Trumpets are often mentioned by writers who have recorded the manners
and customs of the Indians at the time of the discovery of America.There are, however, scarcely any illustrations to be relied on of these
instruments transmitted to us.The Conch was frequently used as a
trumpet for conveying signals in war.[Illustration]

The engraving represents a kind of trumpet made of wood, and nearly
seven feet in length, which Gumilla found among the Indians in the
vicinity of the Orinoco.It somewhat resembles the _juruparis_, a
mysterious instrument of the Indians on the Rio Haupés, a tributary
of the Rio <DW64>, south America.The _juruparis_ is regarded as an
object of great veneration.So
stringent is this law that any woman obtaining a sight of it is put to
death--usually by poison.No youths are allowed to see it until they
have been subjected to a series of initiatory fastings and scourgings.The _juruparis_ is usually kept hidden in the bed of some stream, deep
in the forest; and no one dares to drink out of that sanctified stream,
or to bathe in its water.At feasts the _juruparis_ is brought out
during the night, and is blown outside the houses of entertainment.The inner portion of the instrument consists of a tube made of slips
of the Paxiaba palm (_Triartea exorrhiza_).When the Indians are about
to use the instrument they nearly close the upper end of the tube
with clay, and also tie above the oblong square hole (shown in the
engraving) a portion of the leaf of the Uaruma, one of the arrow-root
family.Round the tube are wrapped long strips of the tough bark of the
Jébaru (_Parivoa grandiflora_).This covering descends in folds below
the tube.The length of the instrument is from four to five feet.The
illustration, which exhibits the _juruparis_ with its cover and without
it, has been taken from a specimen in the museum at Kew gardens.The
mysteries connected with this trumpet are evidently founded on an old
tradition from prehistoric Indian ancestors._Jurupari_ means “demon”;
and with several Indian tribes on the Amazon customs and ceremonies
still prevail in honour of Jurupari.The Caroados, an Indian tribe in Brazil, have a war trumpet which
closely resembles the _juruparis_.With this people it is the custom
for the chief to give on his war trumpet the signal for battle, and to
continue blowing as long as he wishes the battle to last.The trumpet
is made of wood, and its sound is described by travellers as very deep
but rather pleasant.The sound is easily produced, and its continuance
does not require much exertion; but a peculiar vibration of the lips
is necessary which requires practice.Another trumpet, the _turé_, is
common with many Indian tribes on the Amazon who use it chiefly in war.It is made of a long and thick bamboo, and there is a split reed in the
mouthpiece.It therefore partakes rather of the character of an oboe
or clarinet.The _turé_ is
especially used by the sentinels of predatory hordes, who, mounted on a
lofty tree, give the signal of attack to their comrades.Again, the aborigines in Mexico had a curious contrivance of this kind,
the _acocotl_, now more usually called _clarin_.The former word is
its old Indian name, and the latter appears to have been first given
to the instrument by the Spaniards.The _acocotl_ consists of a very
thin tube from eight to ten feet in length, and generally not quite
straight but with some irregular curves.This tube, which is often not
thicker than a couple of inches in diameter, terminates at one end in
a sort of bell, and has at the other end a small mouthpiece resembling
in shape that of a clarinet.The tube is made of the dry stalk of a
plant which is common in Mexico, and which likewise the Indians call
_acocotl_.The most singular characteristic of the instrument is that
the performer does not blow into it, but inhales the air through it; or
rather, he produces the sound by sucking the mouthpiece.It is said to
require strong lungs to perform on the _acocotl_ effectively according
to Indian notions of taste.[Illustration]

The _botuto_, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the river
Orinoco (of which we engrave two examples), was evidently an ancient
Indian contrivance, but appears to have fallen almost into oblivion
during the last two centuries.It was made of baked clay and was
commonly from three to four feet long: but some trumpets of this kind
were of enormous size.The _botuto_ with two bellies was usually made
thicker than that with three bellies and emitted a deeper sound, which
is described as having been really terrific.These trumpets were used
on occasions of mourning and funeral dances.Alexander von Humboldt saw
the _botuto_ among some Indian tribes near the river Orinoco.Besides those which have been noticed, other antique wind instruments
of the Indians are mentioned by historians; but the descriptions given
of them are too superficial to convey a distinct notion as to their
form and purport.Several of these barbarous contrivances scarcely
deserve to be classed with musical instruments.This may, for instance,
be said of certain musical jars or earthen vessels producing sounds,
which the Peruvians constructed for their amusement.These vessels
were made double; and the sounds imitated the cries of animals or
birds.A similar contrivance of the Indians in Chili, preserved in
the museum at Santiago, is described by the traveller S. S. Hill as
follows:--“It consists of two earthen vessels in the form of our
india-rubber bottles, but somewhat larger, with a flat tube from four
to six inches in length, uniting their necks near the top and slightly
curved upwards, and with a small hole on the upper side one third of
the length of the tube from one side of the necks.To produce the
sounds the bottles were filled with water and suspended to the bough
of a tree, or to a beam, by a string attached to the middle of the
curved tube, and then swung backwards and forwards in such a manner as
to cause each end to be alternately the highest and lowest, so that
the water might pass backwards and forwards from one bottle to the
other through the tube between them.By this means soothing sounds were
produced which, it is said, were employed to lull to repose the drowsy
chiefs who usually slept away the hottest hours of the day.In the
meantime, as the bottles were porous, the water within them diminished
by evaporation, and the sound died gradually away.”

[Illustration]

As regards instruments of percussion, a kind of drum deserves special
notice on account of the ingenuity evinced in its construction.The
Mexicans called it _teponaztli_.They generally made it of a single
block of very hard wood, somewhat oblong square in shape, which they
hollowed, leaving at each end a solid piece about three or four inches
in thickness, and at its upper side a kind of sound-board about a
quarter of an inch in thickness.In this sound-board, if it may be
called so, they made three incisions; namely, two running parallel some
distance lengthwise of the drum, and a third running across from one
of these to the other just in the centre.By this means they obtained
two vibrating tongues of wood which, when beaten with a stick, produced
sounds as clearly defined as are those of our kettle drums.By making
one of the tongues thinner than the other they ensured two different
sounds, the pitch of which they were enabled to regulate by shaving
off more or less of the wood.The bottom of the drum they cut almost
entirely open.The traveller, M. Nebel, was told by archæologists in
Mexico that these instruments always contained the interval of a third,
but on examining several specimens which he saw in museums he found
some in which the two sounds stood towards each other in the relation
of a fourth; while in others they constituted a fifth, in others a
sixth, and in some even an octave.This is noteworthy in so far as it
points to a conformity with our diatonic series of intervals, excepting
the seventh.The _teponaztli_ (engraved above) was generally carved with various
fanciful and ingenious designs.It was beaten with two drumsticks
covered at the end with an elastic gum, called _ule_, which was
obtained from the milky juice extracted from the ule-tree.Some of
these drums were small enough to be carried on a string or strap
suspended round the neck of the player; others, again, measured
upwards of five feet in length, and their sound was so powerful that
it could be heard at a distance of three miles.In some rare instances
a specimen of the _teponaztli_ is still preserved by the Indians in
Mexico, especially among tribes who have been comparatively but little
affected by intercourse with their European aggressors.Herr Heller saw
such an instrument in the hands of the Indians of Huatusco--a village
near Mirador in the Tierra templada, or temperate region, occupying
the <DW72>s of the Cordilleras.Its sound is described as so very loud
as to be distinctly audible at an incredibly great distance.This
circumstance, which has been noticed by several travellers, may perhaps
be owing in some measure to the condition of the atmosphere in Mexico.[Illustration]

Instruments of percussion constructed on a principle more or less
similar to the _teponaztli_ were in use in several other parts of
America, as well as in Mexico.Oviedo gives a drawing of a drum from
San Domingo which, as it shows distinctly both the upper and under
side of the instrument, is here inserted.The largest kind of Mexican _teponaztli_ appears to have been
generally of a cylindrical shape.Clavigero gives a drawing of
such an instrument.Drums, also, constructed of skin or parchment
in combination with wood were not unknown to the Indians.Of this
description was, for instance, the _huehuetl_ of the Aztecs in Mexico,
which consisted, according to Clavigero, of a wooden cylinder somewhat
above three feet in height, curiously carved and painted and covered
at the top with carefully prepared deer-skin.And, what appears the
most remarkable, the parchment (we are told) could be tightened or
slackened by means of cords in nearly the same way as with our own
drum.The _huehuetl_ was not beaten with drumsticks but merely struck
with the fingers, and much dexterity was required to strike it in the
proper manner.Oviedo states that the Indians in Cuba had drums which
were stretched with human skin.And Bernal Diaz relates that when he
was with Cortés in Mexico they ascended together the _Teocalli_ (“House
of God”), a large temple in which human sacrifices were offered by
the aborigines; and there the Spanish visitors saw a large drum which
was made, Diaz tells us, with skins of great serpents.This “hellish
instrument,” as he calls it, produced, when struck, a doleful sound
which was so loud that it could be heard at a distance of two leagues.The name of the Peruvian drum was _huanca_: they had also an instrument
of percussion, called _chhilchiles_, which appears to have been a sort
of tambourine.The rattle was likewise popular with the Indians before the discovery
of America.The Mexicans called it _ajacaxtli_.In construction it was
similar to the rattle at the present day commonly used by the Indians.It was oval or round in shape, and appears to have been usually made
of a gourd into which holes were pierced, and to which a wooden handle
was affixed.A number of little pebbles were enclosed in the hollowed
gourd.The little balls in the
_ajacaxtli_ of pottery, enclosed as they are, may at a first glance
appear a puzzle.Probably, when the rattle was being formed they were
attached to the inside as slightly as possible; and after the clay had
been baked they were detached by means of an implement passed through
the holes.[Illustration]

The Tezcucans (or Acolhuans) belonged to the same race as the Aztecs,
whom they greatly surpassed in knowledge and social refinement.Nezahualcoyotl, a wise monarch of the Tezcucans, abhorred human
sacrifices, and erected a large temple which he dedicated to “The
unknown god, the cause of causes.” This edifice had a tower nine
stories high, on the top of which were placed a number of musical
instruments of various kinds which were used to summon the worshippers
to prayer.Respecting these instruments especial mention is made
of a sonorous metal which was struck with a mallet.This is stated
in a historical essay written by Ixtlilxochitl, a native of Mexico
and of royal descent, who lived in the beginning of the seventeenth
century, and who may be supposed to have been familiar with the musical
practices of his countrymen.But whether the sonorous metal alluded to
was a gong or a bell is not clear from the vague record transmitted to
us.That the bell was known to the Peruvians appears to be no longer
doubtful, since a small copper specimen has been found in one of the
old Peruvian tombs.This interesting relic is now deposited in the
museum at Lima.M. de Castelnau has published a drawing of it, which
is here reproduced.The Peruvians called their bells _chanrares_; it
remains questionable whether this name did not designate rather the
so-called horse bells, which were certainly known to the Mexicans
who called them _yotl_.It is noteworthy that these _yotl_ are found
figured in the picture-writings representing the various objects which
the Aztecs used to pay as tribute to their sovereigns.The collection
of Mexican antiquities in the British museum contains a cluster of
yotl-bells.Being nearly round, they closely resemble the _Schellen_
which the Germans are in the habit of affixing to their horses,
particularly in the winter when they are driving their noiseless
sledges.[Illustration]

Again, in south America sonorous stones are not unknown, and were used
in olden time for musical purposes.The traveller G. T. Vigne saw
among the Indian antiquities preserved in the town of Cuzco, in Peru,
“a musical instrument of green sonorous stone, about a foot long, and
an inch and a half wide, flat-sided, pointed at both ends, and arched
at the back, where it was about a quarter of an inch thick, whence it
diminished to an edge, like the blade of a knife.... In the middle of
the back was a small hole, through which a piece of string was passed;
and when suspended and struck by any hard substance a singularly
musical note was produced.” Humboldt mentions the Amazon-stone, which
on being struck by any hard substance yields a metallic sound.It was
formerly cut by the American Indians into very thin plates, perforated
in the centre and suspended by a string.This kind of stone is not, as might be conjectured from its
name, found exclusively near the Amazon.The name was given to it as
well as to the river by the first European visitors to America, in
allusion to the female warriors respecting whom strange stories are
told.The natives pretending, according to an ancient tradition, that
the stone came from the country of “Women without husbands,” or “Women
living alone.”

As regards the ancient stringed instruments of the American Indians
our information is indeed but scanty.Clavigero says that the Mexicans
were entirely unacquainted with stringed instruments: a statement
the correctness of which is questionable, considering the stage of
civilization to which these people had attained.At any rate, we
generally find one or other kind of such instruments with nations
whose intellectual progress and social condition are decidedly
inferior.The Aztecs had many claims to the character of a civilized
community and (as before said) the Tezcucans were even more advanced
in the cultivation of the arts and sciences than the Aztecs.“The
best histories,” Prescott observes, “the best poems, the best code
of laws, the purest dialect, were all allowed to be Tezcucan.The
Aztecs rivalled their neighbours in splendour of living, and even
in the magnificence of their structures.They displayed a pomp and
ostentatious pageantry, truly Asiatic.” Unfortunately historians
are sometimes not sufficiently discerning in their communications
respecting musical questions.J. Ranking, in describing the grandeur
of the establishment maintained by Montezuma, says that during the
repasts of this monarch “there was music of fiddle, flute, snail-shell,
a kettle-drum, and other strange instruments.” But as this writer does
not indicate the source whence he drew his information respecting
Montezuma’s orchestra including the fiddle, the assertion deserves
scarcely a passing notice.The Peruvians possessed a stringed instrument, called _tinya_, which
was provided with five or seven strings.To conjecture from the
unsatisfactory account of it transmitted to us, the _tinya_ appears to
have been a kind of guitar.Considering the fragility of the materials
of which such instruments are generally constructed, it is perhaps
not surprising that we do not meet with any specimens of them in the
museums of American antiquities.A few remarks will not be out of place here referring to the musical
performances of the ancient Indians; since an acquaintance with the
nature of the performances is likely to afford additional assistance
in appreciating the characteristics of the instruments.In Peru, where
the military system was carefully organised, each division of the army
had its trumpeters, called _cqueppacamayo_, and its drummers, called
_huancarcamayo_.When the Inca returned with his troops victorious from
battle his first act was to repair to the temple of the Sun in order
to offer up thanksgiving; and after the conclusion of this ceremony
the people celebrated the event with festivities, of which music and
dancing constituted a principal part.Musical performances appear to
have been considered indispensable on occasions of public celebrations;
and frequent mention is made of them by historians who have described
the festivals annually observed by the Peruvians.About the month of October the Peruvians celebrated a solemn feast in
honour of the dead, at which ceremony they executed lugubrious songs
and plaintive instrumental music.Compositions of a similar character
were performed on occasion of the decease of a monarch.As soon as it
was made known to the people that their Inca had been “called home to
the mansions of his father the sun” they prepared to celebrate his
obsequies with becoming solemnity.Prescott, in his graphic description
of these observances, says: “At stated intervals, for a year, the
people assembled to renew the expressions of their sorrow; processions
were made displaying the banner of the departed monarch; bards and
minstrels were appointed to chronicle his achievements, and their songs
continued to be rehearsed at high festivals in the presence of the
reigning monarch,--thus stimulating the living by the glorious example
of the dead.” The Peruvians had also particular agricultural songs,
which they were in the habit of singing while engaged in tilling the
lands of the Inca; a duty which devolved upon the whole nation.The
subject of these songs, or rather hymns, referred especially to the
noble deeds and glorious achievements of the Inca and his dynasty.While thus singing, the labourers regulated their work to the rhythm
of the music, thereby ensuring a pleasant excitement and a stimulant in
their occupation, like soldiers regulating their steps to the music of
the military band.These hymns pleased the Spanish invaders so greatly
that they not only adopted several of them but also composed some in a
similar form and style.This appears, however, to have been the case
rather with the poetry than with the music.The name of the Peruvian elegiac songs was _haravi_.Some tunes of
these songs, pronounced to be genuine specimens, have been published
in recent works; but their genuineness is questionable.At all events
they must have been much tampered with, as they exhibit exactly the
form of the Spanish _bolero_.Even allowing that the melodies of
these compositions have been derived from Peruvian _harivaris_, it is
impossible to determine with any degree of certainty how much in them
has been retained of the original tunes, and how much has been supplied
besides the harmony, which is entirely an addition of the European
arranger.The Peruvians had minstrels, called _haravecs_ (_i.e._,
“inventors”), whose occupation it was to compose and to recite the
_haravis_.The Mexicans possessed a class of songs which served as a record
of historical events.Furthermore they had war-songs, love-songs,
and other secular vocal compositions, as well as sacred chants, in
the practice of which boys were instructed by the priests in order
that they might assist in the musical performances of the temple.It appertained to the office of the priests to burn incense, and
to perform music in the temple at stated times of the day.The
commencement of the religious observances which took place regularly
at sunrise, at mid-day, at sunset, and at midnight, was announced by
signals blown on trumpets and pipes.Persons of high position retained
in their service professional musicians whose duty it was to compose
ballads, and to perform vocal music with instrumental accompaniment.The nobles themselves, and occasionally even the monarch, not
unfrequently delighted in composing ballads and odes.Especially to be noticed is the institution termed “Council of music,”
which the wise monarch Nezahualcoyotl founded in Tezcuco.This
institution was not intended exclusively for promoting the cultivation
of music; its aim comprised the advancement of various arts, and of
sciences such as history, astronomy, &c. In fact, it was an academy
for general education.Probably no better evidence could be cited
testifying to the remarkable intellectual attainments of the Mexican
Indians before the discovery of America than this council of music.Although in some respects it appears to have resembled the board of
music of the Chinese, it was planned on a more enlightened and more
comprehensive principle.The Chinese “board of music,” called _Yo
Poo_, is an office connected with the _Lé Poo_ or “board of rites,”
established by the imperial government at Peking.The principal object
of the board of rites is to regulate the ceremonies on occasions
of sacrifices offered to the gods; of festivals and certain court
solemnities; of military reviews; of presentations, congratulations,
marriages, deaths, burials,--in short, concerning almost every possible
event in social and public life.The reader is probably aware that in one of the various hypotheses
which have been advanced respecting the Asiatic origin of the American
Indians China is assigned to them as their ancient home.Some
historians suppose them to be emigrants from Mongolia, Thibet, or
Hindustan; others maintain that they are the offspring of Phœnician
colonists who settled in central America.Even more curious are the
arguments of certain inquirers who have no doubt whatever that the
ancestors of the American Indians were the lost ten tribes of Israel,
of whom since about the time of the Babylonian captivity history is
silent.Whatever may be thought as to which particular one of these
speculations hits the truth, they certainly have all proved useful
in so far as they have made ethnologists more exactly acquainted with
the habits and predilections of the American aborigines than would
otherwise have been the case.For, as the advocates of each hypothesis
have carefully collected and adduced every evidence they were able
to obtain tending to support their views, the result is that (so to
say) no stone has been left unturned.Nevertheless, any such hints as
suggest themselves from an examination of musical instruments have
hitherto remained unheeded.It may therefore perhaps interest the
reader to have his attention drawn to a few suggestive similarities
occurring between instruments of the American Indians and of certain
nations inhabiting the eastern hemisphere.We have seen that the Mexican pipe and the Peruvian syrinx were
purposely constructed so as to produce the intervals of the pentatonic
scale only.There are some additional indications of this scale having
been at one time in use with the American Indians.For instance, the
music of the Peruvian dance _cachua_ is described as having been very
similar to some Scotch national dances; and the most conspicuous
characteristics of the Scotch tunes are occasioned by the frequently
exclusive employment of intervals appertaining to the pentatonic scale.We find precisely the same series of intervals adopted on certain
Chinese instruments, and evidences are not wanting of the pentatonic
scale having been popular among various races in Asia at a remote
period.The series of intervals appertaining to the Chiriqui pipe,
mentioned page 61, consisted of a semitone and two whole tones, like
the _tetrachord_ of the ancient Greeks.In the Peruvian _huayra-puhura_ made of talc some of the pipes possess
lateral holes.This contrivance, which is rather unusual, occurs on the
Chinese _cheng_.The _chayna_, mentioned page 64, seems to have been
provided with a reed, like the oboe: and in Hindustan we find a species
of oboe called _shehna_.The _turé_ of the Indian tribes on the Amazon,
mentioned page 69, reminds us of the trumpets _tooree_, or _tootooree_,
of the Hindus.The name appears to have been known also to the Arabs;
but there is no indication whatever of its having been transmitted to
the peninsula by the Moors, and afterwards to south America by the
Portuguese and Spaniards.The wooden tongues in the drum _teponaztli_ may be considered as a
contrivance exclusively of the ancient American Indians.Nevertheless
a construction nearly akin to it may be observed in certain drums of
the Tonga and Feejee islanders, and of the natives of some islands
in Torres strait.Likewise some <DW64> tribes in western and central
Africa have certain instruments of percussion which are constructed on
a principle somewhat reminding us of the _teponaztli_.The method of
bracing the drum by means of cords, as exhibited in the _huehueil_ of
the Mexican Indians, is evidently of very high antiquity in the east.Rattles, pandean pipes made of reed, and conch trumpets, are found
almost all over the world, wherever the materials of which they are
constructed are easily obtainable.Still, it may be noteworthy that
the Mexicans employed the conch trumpet in their religious observances
apparently in much the same way as it is used in the Buddhist worship
of the Thibetans and Kalmuks.As regards the sonorous metal in the great temple at Tezcuco some
inquirers are sure that it was a gong: but it must be borne in mind
that these inquirers detect everywhere traces proving an invasion of
the Mongols, which they maintain to have happened about six hundred
years ago.Had they been acquainted with the little Peruvian bell
(engraved on page 75) they would have had more tangible musical
evidence in support of their theory than the supposed gong; for this
bell certainly bears a suggestive resemblance to the little hand-bell
which the Buddhists use in their religious ceremonies.The Peruvians interpolated certain songs, especially those which they
were in the habit of singing while cultivating the fields, with the
word _hailli_ which signified “Triumph.” As the subject of these
compositions was principally the glorification of the Inca, the burden
_hailli_ is perhaps all the more likely to remind Europeans of the
Hebrew _hallelujah_.Moreover, Adair, who lived among the Indians of
north America during a period of about forty years, speaks of some
other words which he found used as burdens in hymns sung on solemn
occasions, and which appeared to him to correspond with certain Hebrew
words of a sacred import.As regards the musical accomplishments of the Indian tribes at the
present day they are far below the standard which we have found among
their ancestors.A period of three hundred years of oppression has
evidently had the effect of subduing the melodious expressions of
happiness and contentedness which in former times appear to have
been quite as prevalent with the Indians as they generally are with
independent and flourishing nations.The innate talent for music
evinced by those of the North American Indians who were converted to
Christianity soon after the emigration of the puritans to New England
is very favourably commented on by some old writers.In the year 1661
John Elliot published a translation of the psalms into Indian verse.The singing of these metrical psalms by the Indian converts in their
places of worship appears to have been actually superior to the sacred
vocal performances of their Christian brethren from Europe; for we find
it described by several witnesses as “excellent” and “most ravishing.”

In other parts of America the catholic priests from Spain did not
neglect to turn to account the susceptibility of the Indians for
music.Thus, in central America the Dominicans composed as early as in
the middle of the sixteenth century a sacred poem in the Guatemalian
dialect containing a narrative of the most important events recorded
in the Bible.This production they sang to the natives, and to enhance
the effect they accompanied the singing with musical instruments.The
alluring music soon captivated the heart of a powerful cazique, who
was thus induced to adopt the doctrines embodied in the composition,
and to diffuse them among his subjects who likewise delighted in the
performances.In Peru a similar experiment, resorted to by the priests
who accompanied Pizarro’s expedition, proved equally successful.They
dramatized certain scenes in the life of Christ and represented them
with music, which so greatly fascinated the Indians that many of them
readily embraced the new faith.Nor are these entertainments dispensed
with even at the present day by the Indian Christians, especially
in the village churches of the Sierra in Peru; and as several
religious ceremonies have been retained by these people from their
heathen forefathers, it may be conjectured that their sacred musical
performances also retain much of their ancient heathen character.Most of the musical instruments found among the American Indians at
the present day are evidently genuine old Indian contrivances as they
existed long before the discovery of America.Take, for example, the
peculiarly shaped rattles, drums, flutes, and whistles of the North
American Indians, of which some specimens in the Kensington museum are
described in the large catalogue.A few African instruments, introduced
by the <DW64> slaves, are now occasionally found in the hands of the
Indians, and have been by some travellers erroneously described as
genuine Indian inventions.This is the case with the African _marimba_,
which has become rather popular with the natives of Guatemala in
central America: but such adaptations are very easily discernible.EUROPEAN NATIONS DURING THE MIDDLE AGES.Many representations of musical instruments of the middle ages have
been preserved in manuscripts, as well as in sculptures and paintings
forming ornamental portions of churches and other buildings.Valuable
facts and hints are obtainable from these evidences, provided they
are judiciously selected and carefully examined.The subject is,
however, so large that only a few observations on the most interesting
instruments can be offered here.Unfortunately there still prevails
much uncertainty respecting several of the earliest representations
as to the precise century from which they date, and there is reason
to believe that in some instances the archæological zeal of musical
investigators has assigned a higher antiquity to such discoveries than
can be satisfactorily proved.It appears certain that the most ancient European instruments known to
us were in form and construction more like the Asiatic than was the
case with later ones.Before a nation has attained to a rather high
degree of civilisation its progress in the cultivation of music, as an
art, is very slow indeed.The instruments found at the present day in
Asia are scarcely superior to those which were in use among oriental
nations about three thousand years ago.It is, therefore, perhaps
not surprising that no material improvement is perceptible in the
construction of the instruments of European countries during the lapse
of nearly a thousand years.True, evidences to be relied on referring
to the first five or six centuries of the Christian era are but scanty;
although indications are not wanting which may help the reflecting
musician.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

There are some early monuments of Christian art dating from the fourth
century in which the lyre is represented.In one of them Christ is
depicted as Apollo touching the lyre.This instrument occurs at an
early period in western Europe as used in popular pastimes.In an
Anglo-saxon manuscript of the ninth century in the British museum
(Cleopatra C.are the figures of two gleemen, one playing the
lyre and the other a double-pipe.M. de Coussemaker has published in
the “Annales Archéologiques” the figure of a crowned personage playing
the lyre, which he found in a manuscript of the ninth or tenth century
in the library at Angers.The player twangs the strings with his
fingers, while the Anglo-saxon gleeman before mentioned uses a plectrum._Cithara_ was a name applied to several stringed instruments greatly
varying in form, power of sound, and compass.The illustration
represents a cithara from a manuscript of the ninth century, formerly
in the library of the great monastery of St.When in the year 1768 the monastery was destroyed by fire, this
valuable book perished in the flames; fortunately the celebrated abbot
Gerbert possessed tracings of the illustrations, which were saved from
destruction.He published them, in the year 1774, in his work “De cantu
et musica sacra.” Several illustrations in the following pages, it
will be seen, have been derived from this interesting source.As the
older works on music were generally written in Latin we do not learn
from them the popular names of the instruments; the writers merely
adopted such Latin names as they thought the most appropriate.Thus,
for instance, a very simple stringed instrument of a triangular shape,
and a somewhat similar one of a square shape were designated by the
name of _psalterium_; and we further give a woodcut of the square kind
(p.86), and of a _cithara_ (above) from the same manuscript.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

This last instrument is evidently an improvement upon the triangular
psalterium, because it has a sort of small sound-board at the top.Scarcely better, with regard to acoustics, appears to have been the
instrument designated as _nablum_, which we engrave (p.87) from a
manuscript of the ninth century at Angers.[Illustration]

A small psalterium with strings placed over a sound-board was
apparently the prototype of the _citole_; a kind of dulcimer which was
played with the fingers.The names were not only often vaguely applied
by the mediæval writers but they changed also in almost every century.The psalterium, or psalterion (Italian _salterio_, English _psaltery_),
of the fourteenth century and later had the trapezium shape of the
dulcimer.[Illustration]

The Anglo-saxons frequently accompanied their vocal effusions with a
harp, more or less triangular in shape,--an instrument which may be
considered rather as constituting the transition of the lyre into the
harp.The representation of king David playing the harp is from an
Anglo-saxon manuscript of the beginning of the eleventh century, in
the British museum.The harp was especially popular in central and
northern Europe, and was the favourite instrument of the German and
Celtic bards and of the Scandinavian skalds.In the next illustration
from the manuscript of the monastery of St.Blasius twelve strings
and two sound holes are given to it.A harp similar in form and size,
but without the front pillar, was known to the ancient Egyptians.Perhaps the addition was also non-existent in the earliest specimens
appertaining to European nations; and a sculptured figure of a small
harp constructed like the ancient eastern harp has been discovered in
the old church of Ullard in the county of Kilkenny.Of this curious
relic, which is said to date from a period anterior to the year 800, a
fac-simile taken from Bunting’s “Ancient Music of Ireland” is given (p.As Bunting was the first who drew attention to this sculpture his
account of it may interest the reader.“The drawing” he says “is taken
from one of the ornamental compartments of a sculptured cross, at the
old church of Ullard.From the style of the workmanship, as well as
from the worn condition of the cross, it seems older than the similar
monument at Monasterboice which is known to have been set up before the
year 830.The sculpture is rude; the circular rim which binds the arms
of the cross together is not pierced in the quadrants, and many of the
figures originally in relievo are now wholly abraded.It is difficult
to determine whether the number of strings represented is six or seven;
but, as has been already remarked, accuracy in this respect cannot be
expected either in sculptures or in many picturesque drawings.” The
Finns had a harp (_harpu_, _kantele_) with a similar frame, devoid of
a front pillar, still in use until the commencement of the present
century.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

One of the most interesting stringed instruments of the middle ages
is the _rotta_ (German, _rotte_; English, _rote_).It was sounded by
twanging the strings, and also by the application of the bow.The first
method was, of course, the elder one.There can hardly be a doubt
that when the bow came into use it was applied to certain popular
instruments which previously had been treated like the _cithara_ or
the _psalterium_.The Hindus at the present day use their _suroda_
sometimes as a lute and sometimes as a fiddle.In some measure we
do the same with the violin by playing occasionally _pizzicato_.The
_rotta_ (shown p.Blasius is called in
Gerbert’s work _cithara teutonica_, while the harp is called _cithara
anglica_; from which it would appear that the former was regarded as
pre-eminently a German instrument.Possibly its name may have been
originally _chrotta_ and the continental nations may have adopted it
from the Celtic races of the British isles, dropping the guttural
sound.This hypothesis is, however, one of those which have been
advanced by some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

We engrave also another representation of David playing on the
_rotta_, from a psalter of the seventh century in the British museum
(Cott.According to tradition, this psalter is one of
the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St.The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand of the musician
(see p.22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the time of Joseph.In
the _rotta_ the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized.An
illumination of king David playing the _rotta_ forms the frontispiece
of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved in the cathedral
library of Durham; and which is musically interesting inasmuch as
it represents a _rotta_ of an oblong square shape like that just
noticed and resembling the Welsh _crwth_.It has only five strings
which the performer twangs with his fingers.Again, a very interesting
representation (which we engrave) of the Psalmist with a kind of
_rotta_ occurs in a manuscript of the tenth century, in the British
museum (Vitellius F.The manuscript has been much injured by
a fire in the year 1731, but Professor Westwood has succeeded, with
great care, and with the aid of a magnifying glass, in making out
the lines of the figure.As it has been ascertained that the psalter
is written in the Irish semi-uncial character it is highly probable
that the kind of _rotta_ represents the Irish _cionar cruit_, which
was played by twanging the strings and also by the application of a
bow.Unfortunately we possess no well-authenticated representation
of the Welsh _crwth_ of an early period; otherwise we should in all
probability find it played with the fingers, or with a plectrum.Venantius Fortunatus, an Italian who lived in the second half of the
sixth century, mentions in a poem the “Chrotta Britanna.” He does
not, however, allude to the bow, and there is no reason to suppose
that it existed in England.Howbeit, the Welsh _crwth_ (Anglo-saxon,
_crudh_; English, _crowd_) is only known as a species of fiddle closely
resembling the _rotta_, but having a finger-board in the middle of the
open frame and being strung with only a few strings; while the _rotta_
had sometimes above twenty strings.As it may interest the reader to
examine the form of the modern _crwth_ we give a woodcut of it.Edward
Jones, in his “Musical and poetical relicks of the Welsh bards,”
records that the Welsh had before this kind of _crwth_ a three-stringed
one called “Crwth Trithant,” which was, he says, “a sort of violin, or
more properly a rebeck.” The three-stringed _crwth_ was chiefly used by
the inferior class of bards; and was probably the Moorish fiddle which
is still the favourite instrument of the itinerant bards of the Bretons
in France, who call it _rébek_.The Bretons, it will be remembered, are
close kinsmen of the Welsh.[Illustration]

A player on the _crwth_ or _crowd_ (a crowder) from a bas-relief on the
under part of the seats of the choir in Worcester cathedral (engraved
p.95) dates from the twelfth or thirteenth century; and we give (p.96) a copy of an illumination from a manuscript in the Bibliothèque
royale at Paris of the eleventh century.The player wears a crown on
his head; and in the original some musicians placed at his side are
performing on the psalterium and other instruments.These last are
figured with uncovered heads; whence M. de Coussemaker concludes that
the _crout_ was considered by the artist who drew the figures as the
noblest instrument.It was probably identical with the _rotta_ of the
same century on the continent.[Illustration]

An interesting drawing of an Anglo-saxon fiddle--or _fithele_, as it
was called--is given in a manuscript of the eleventh century in the
British museum (Cotton, Tiberius, c.The instrument is of a pear
shape, with four strings, and the bridge is not indicated.A German
fiddle of the ninth century, called _lyra_, copied by Gerbert from the
manuscript of St.These are shown in the
woodcuts (p.Other records of the employment of the fiddle-bow
in Germany in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are not wanting.For instance, in the famous ‘Nibelungenlied’ Volker is described as
wielding the fiddle-bow not less dexterously than the sword.And in
‘Chronicon picturatum Brunswicense’ of the year 1203, the following
miraculous sign is recorded as having occurred in the village of
Ossemer: “On Wednesday in Whitsun-week, while the parson was fiddling
to his peasants who were dancing, there came a flash of lightning
and struck the parson’s arm which held the fiddle-bow, and killed
twenty-four people on the spot.”

[Illustration]

Among the oldest representations of performers on instruments of the
violin kind found in England those deserve to be noticed which are
painted on the interior of the roof of Peterborough cathedral.They
are said to date from the twelfth century.One of these figures is
particularly interesting on account of the surprising resemblance which
his instrument bears to our present violin.Not only the incurvations
on the sides of the body but also the two sound-holes are nearly
identical in shape with those made at the present day.Respecting the
reliance to be placed on such evidence, it is necessary to state that
the roof, originally constructed between the years 1177 and 1194, was
thoroughly repaired in the year 1835.Although we find it asserted that
“the greatest care was taken to retain every part, or to restore it
to its original state, so that the figures, even where retouched, are
in effect the same as when first painted,” it nevertheless remains a
debatable question whether the restorers have not admitted some slight
alterations, and have thereby somewhat modernised the appearance of
the instruments.A slight touch with the brush at the sound-holes, the
screws, or the curvatures, would suffice to produce modifications which
might to the artist appear as being only a renovation of the original
representation, but which to the musical investigator greatly impair
the value of the evidence.Sculptures are, therefore, more to be
relied upon in evidence than frescoes.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.The construction of the _organistrum_ requires but little explanation.A glance at the finger-board reveals at once that the different
tones were obtained by raising the keys placed on the neck under the
strings, and that the keys were raised by means of the handles at
the side of the neck.Of the two bridges shown on the body, the one
situated nearest the middle was formed by a wheel in the inside, which
projected through the sound-board.The wheel which slightly touched
the strings vibrated them by friction when turned by the handle at
the end.The order of intervals was _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _a_,
_b-flat_, _b-natural_, _c_, and were obtainable on the highest string.There is reason to suppose that the other two strings were generally
tuned a fifth and an octave below the highest.The _organistrum_ may
be regarded as the predecessor of the hurdy-gurdy, and was a rather
cumbrous contrivance.Two persons seem to have been required to sound
it, one to turn the handle and the other to manage the keys.Thus it is
generally represented in mediæval concerts.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _monochord_ (p.100) was mounted with a single string stretched
over two bridges which were fixed on an oblong box.The string could be
tightened or slackened by means of a turning screw inserted into one
end of the box.The intervals of the scale were marked on the side, and
were regulated by a sort of movable bridge placed beneath the string
when required.As might be expected, the _monochord_ was chiefly used
by theorists; for any musical performance it was but little suitable.About a thousand years ago when this monochord was in use the musical
scale was diatonic, with the exception of the interval of the seventh,
which was chromatic inasmuch as both _b-flat_ and _b-natural_ formed
part of the scale.The notation on the preceding page exhibits the
compass as well as the order of intervals adhered to about the tenth
century.This ought to be borne in mind in examining the representations of
musical instruments transmitted to us from that period.As regards the wind instruments popular during the middle ages, some
were of quaint form as well as of rude construction.The _chorus_, or _choron_, had either one or two tubes, as in the
woodcut page 101.There were several varieties of this instrument;
sometimes it was constructed with a bladder into which the tube is
inserted; this kind of _chorus_ resembled the bagpipe; another kind
resembled the _poongi_ of the Hindus, mentioned page 51.The name
_chorus_ was also applied to certain stringed instruments.One of
these had much the form of the _cithara_, page 86.It appears however,
probable that _chorus_ or _choron_ originally designated a horn
(Hebrew, _Keren_; Greek, _Keras_; Latin, _cornu_).[Illustration]

The flutes of the middle ages were blown at the end, like the
flageolet.Of the _syrinx_ there are extant some illustrations of the
ninth and tenth centuries, which exhibit the instrument with a number
of tubes tied together, just like the Pandean pipe still in use.In one
specimen engraved (page 102) from a manuscript of the eleventh century
the tubes were inserted into a bowl-shaped box.This is probably the
_frestele_, _fretel_, or _fretiau_, which in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries was in favour with the French ménétriers.Some large Anglo-saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript of the
eighth century in the British museum.The largest kind of trumpet was
placed on a stand when blown.Of the _oliphant_, or hunting horn, some
fine specimens are in the South Kensington collection.The _sackbut_
(of which we give a woodcut) probably made of metal, could be drawn
out to alter the pitch of sound.The sackbut of the ninth century had,
however, a very different shape to that in use about three centuries
ago, and much more resembled the present _trombone_.The name _sackbut_
is supposed to be a corruption of _sambuca_.The French, about the
fifteenth century, called it _sacqueboute_ and _saquebutte_.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The most important wind instrument--in fact, the king of all the
musical instruments--is the organ.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _pneumatic organ_ is sculptured on an obelisk which was erected
in Constantinople under Theodosius the great, towards the end of the
fourth century.The bellows were pressed by men standing on them:
see page 103.This interesting monument also exhibits performers on
the double flute.The _hydraulic organ_, which is recorded to have
been already known about two hundred years before the Christian era,
was according to some statements occasionally employed in churches
during the earlier centuries of the middle ages.Probably it was more
frequently heard in secular entertainments for which it was more
suitable; and at the beginning of the fourteenth century appears to
have been entirely supplanted by the pneumatic organ.The earliest
organs had only about a dozen pipes.The largest, which were made
about nine hundred years ago, had only three octaves, in which the
chromatic intervals did not occur.Some progress in the construction
of the organ is exhibited in an illustration (engraved p.104) dating
from the twelfth century, in a psalter of Eadwine, in the library of
Trinity college, Cambridge.The instrument has ten pipes, or perhaps
fourteen, as four of them appear to be double pipes.It required four
men exerting all their power to produce the necessary wind, and two men
to play the instrument.Moreover, both players seem also to be busily
engaged in directing the blowers about the proper supply of wind.It must be admitted that since the twelfth
century some progress has been made, at all events, in the construction
of the organ.[Illustration]

The pedal is generally believed to have been invented by Bernhard, a
German, who lived in Venice about the year 1470.There are, however,
indications extant pointing to an earlier date of its invention.Perhaps Bernhard was the first who, by adopting a more practicable
construction, made the pedal more generally known.On the earliest
organs the keys of the finger-board were of enormous size, compared
with those of the present day; so that a finger-board with only nine
keys had a breadth of from four to five feet.The organist struck the
keys down with his fist, as is done in playing the _carillon_ still in
use on the continent, of which presently some account will be given.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Of the little portable organ, known as the _regal_ or _regals_,
often tastefully shaped and embellished, some interesting sculptured
representations are still extant in the old ecclesiastical edifices
of England and Scotland.There is, for instance, in Beverley minster
a figure of a man playing on a single regal, or a regal provided
with only one set of pipes; and in Melrose abbey the figure of an
angel holding in his arms a double regal, the pipes of which are in
two sets.The regal generally had keys like those of the organ but
smaller.A painting in the national Gallery, by Melozzo da Forli
who lived in the fifteenth century, contains a regal which has keys
of a peculiar shape, rather resembling the pistons of certain brass
instruments.To avoid misapprehension, it is necessary to mention that the name
_regal_ (or _regals_, _rigols_) was also applied to an instrument
of percussion with sonorous slabs of wood.This contrivance was, in
short, a kind of harmonica, resembling in shape as well as in the
principle of its construction the little glass harmonica, a mere toy,
in which slips of glass are arranged according to our musical scale.In England it appears to have been still known in the beginning of the
eighteenth century.Grassineau describes the “Rigols” as “a kind of
musical instrument consisting of several sticks bound together, only
separated by beads.It makes a tolerable harmony, being well struck
with a ball at the end of a stick.” In the earlier centuries of the
middle ages there appear to have been some instruments of percussion in
favour, to which Grassineau’s expression “a tolerable harmony” would
scarcely have been applicable.Drums, of course, were known; and their
rhythmical noise must have been soft music, compared with the shrill
sounds of the _cymbalum_; a contrivance consisting of a number of metal
plates suspended on cords, so that they could be clashed together
simultaneously; or with the clangour of the _cymbalum_ constructed
with bells instead of plates; or with the piercing noise of the
_bunibulum_, or _bombulom_; an instrument which consisted of an angular
frame to which were loosely attached metal plates of various shapes
and sizes.The lower part of the frame constituted the handle: and to
produce the noise it evidently was shaken somewhat like the sistrum of
the ancient Egyptians.[Illustration]

The _triangle_ nearly resembled the instrument of this name in use
at the present day; it was more elegant in shape and had some metal
ornamentation in the middle.The _tintinnabulum_ consisted of a number of bells arranged in regular
order and suspended in a frame.[Illustration]




CHAPTER IX.Respecting the orchestras, or musical bands, represented on monuments
of the middle ages, there can hardly be a doubt that the artists who
sculptured them were not unfrequently led by their imagination rather
than by an adherence to actual fact.It is, however, not likely that
they introduced into such representations instruments that were never
admitted in the orchestras, and which would have appeared inappropriate
to the contemporaries of the artists.An examination of one or two
of the orchestras may therefore find a place here, especially as
they throw some additional light upon the characteristics of the
instrumental music of mediæval time.A very interesting group of music performers dating, it is said, from
the end of the eleventh century is preserved in a bas-relief which
formerly ornamented the abbey of St.Georges de Boscherville and which
is now removed to the museum of Rouen.The orchestra comprises twelve
performers, most of whom wear a crown.The first of them plays upon
a viol, which he holds between his knees as the violoncello is held.His instrument is scarcely as large as the smallest viola da gamba.By
his side are a royal lady and her attendant, the former playing on an
_organistrum_ of which the latter is turning the wheel.Next to these
is represented a performer on a _syrinx_ of the kind shown in the
engraving p.112; and next to him a performer on a stringed instrument
resembling a lute, which, however, is too much dilapidated to be
recognisable.Then we have a musician with a small stringed instrument
resembling the _nablum_, p.The next musician, also represented as
a royal personage, plays on a small species of harp.Then follows a
crowned musician playing the viol which he holds in almost precisely
the same manner as the violin is held.Again, another, likewise
crowned, plays upon a harp, using with the right hand a plectrum
and with the left hand merely his fingers.The last two performers,
apparently a gentleman and a gentlewoman, are engaged in striking the
_tintinnabulum_,--a set of bells in a frame.[Illustration]

In this group of crowned minstrels the sculptor has introduced a
tumbler standing on his head, perhaps the vocalist of the company, as
he has no instrument to play upon.Possibly the sculptor desired to
symbolise the hilarious effects which music is capable of producing, as
well as its elevating influence upon the devotional feelings.[Illustration]

The two positions in which we find the viol held is worthy of notice,
inasmuch as it refers the inquirer further back than might be expected
for the origin of our peculiar method of holding the violin, and the
violoncello, in playing.There were several kinds of the viol in use
differing in size and in compass of sound.The most common number of
strings was five, and it was tuned in various ways.One kind had a
string tuned to the note [Illustration] running at the side of the
finger-board instead of over it; this string was, therefore, only
capable of producing a single tone.The four other strings were tuned
thus: [Illustration] Two other species, on which all the strings
were placed over the finger-board, were tuned: [Illustration] and:
[Illustration] The woodcut above represents a very beautiful _vielle_;
French, of about 1550, with monograms of Henry II.The contrivance of placing a string or two at the side of the
finger-board is evidently very old, and was also gradually adopted on
other instruments of the violin class of a somewhat later period than
that of the _vielle_; for instance, on the _lira di braccio_ of the
Italians.It was likewise adopted on the lute, to obtain a fuller power
in the bass; and hence arose the _theorbo_, the _archlute_, and other
varieties of the old lute.[Illustration:

  A. REID.ORCHESTRA, TWELFTH CENTURY, AT SANTIAGO.]A grand assemblage of musical performers is represented on the
Portico della gloria of the famous pilgrimage church of Santiago da
Compostella, in Spain.This triple portal, which is stated by an
inscription on the lintel to have been executed in the year 1188,
consists of a large semicircular arch with a smaller arch on either
side.The central arch is filled by a tympanum, round which are
twenty-four life-sized seated figures, in high relief, representing the
twenty-four elders seen by St.John in the Apocalypse, each with an
instrument of music.These instruments are carefully represented and
are of great interest as showing those in use in Spain at about the
twelfth century.A cast of this sculpture is in the Kensington museum.In examining the group of musicians on this sculpture the reader will
probably recognise several instruments in their hands, which are
identical with those already described in the preceding pages.The
_organistrum_, played by two persons, is placed in the centre of the
group, perhaps owing to its being the largest of the instruments rather
than that it was distinguished by any superiority in sound or musical
effect.Besides the small harp seen in the hands of the eighth and
nineteenth musicians (in form nearly identical with the Anglo-saxon
harp) we find a small triangular harp, without a front-pillar, held on
the lap by the fifth and eighteenth musicians.The _salterio_ on the
lap of the tenth and seventeenth musicians resembles the dulcimer, but
seems to be played with the fingers instead of with hammers.The most
interesting instrument in this orchestra is the _vihuela_, or Spanish
viol, of the twelfth century.The first, second, third, sixth, seventh,
ninth, twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth
musicians are depicted with a _vihuela_ which bears a close resemblance
to the _rebec_.The instrument is represented with three strings,
although in one or two instances five tuning-pegs are indicated.A
large species of _vihuela_ is given to the eleventh, fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth musicians.This instrument differs from the
_rebec_ in as far as its body is broader and has incurvations at the
sides.Also the sound-holes are different in form and position.The bow
does not occur with any of these viols.But, as will be observed, the
musicians are not represented in the act of playing; they are tuning
and preparing for the performance, and the second of them is adjusting
the bridge of his instrument.[Illustration: FRONT OF THE MINSTRELS’ GALLERY, EXETER CATHEDRAL.The minstrels’ gallery of Exeter cathedral dates from the fourteenth
century.The front is divided into twelve niches, each of which
contains a winged figure or an angel playing on an instrument of music.There is a cast also of this famous sculpture at South Kensington.The
instruments are so much dilapidated that some of them cannot be clearly
recognized; but, as far as may be ascertained, they appear to be as
follows:--1.The _clarion_, a small
trumpet having a shrill sound.The _gittern_, a
small guitar strung with catgut.The _timbrel_;
resembling our present tambourine, with a double row of gingles._Cymbals._ Most of these instruments have been already noticed in the
preceding pages.The _shalm_, or _shawm_, was a pipe with a reed in
the mouth-hole.The _wait_ was an English wind instrument of the same
construction.If it differed in any respect from the _shalm_, the
difference consisted probably in the size only.The _wait_ obtained its
name from being used principally by watchmen, or _waights_, to proclaim
the time of night.Such were the poor ancestors of our fine oboe and
clarinet.CHAPTER X.


POST-MEDIÆVAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.Attention must now be drawn to some instruments which originated during
the middle ages, but which attained their highest popularity at a
somewhat later period.[Illustration]

Among the best known of these was the _virginal_, of which we give an
engraving from a specimen of the time of Elizabeth at South Kensington.Another was the _lute_, which about three hundred years ago was almost
as popular as is at the present day the pianoforte.Originally it had
eight thin catgut strings arranged in four pairs, each pair being tuned
in unison; so that its open strings produced four tones; but in the
course of time more strings were added.Until the sixteenth century
twelve was the largest number or, rather, six pairs.Eleven appear
for some centuries to have been the most usual number of strings:
these produced six tones, since they were arranged in five pairs and a
single string.The latter, called the _chanterelle_, was the highest.According to Thomas Mace, the English lute in common use during the
seventeenth century had twenty-four strings, arranged in twelve pairs,
of which six pairs ran over the finger-board and the other six by
the side of it.This lute was therefore, more properly speaking, a
theorbo.The neck of the lute, and also of the theorbo, had frets
consisting of catgut strings tightly fastened round it at the proper
distances required for ensuring a chromatic succession of intervals.The illustration on the next page represents a lute-player of the
sixteenth century.The frets are not indicated in the old engraving
from which the illustration has been taken.The order of tones adopted
for the open strings varied in different centuries and countries:
and this was also the case with the notation of lute music.The most
common practice was to write the music on six lines, the upper line
representing the first string; the second line, the second string, &c.,
and to mark with letters on the lines the frets at which the fingers
ought to be placed--_a_ indicating the open string, _b_ the first fret,
_c_ the second fret, and so on.The lute was made of various sizes according to the purpose for
which it was intended in performance.The treble-lute was of the
smallest dimensions, and the bass-lute of the largest.The _theorbo_,
or double-necked lute which appears to have come into use during
the sixteenth century, had in addition to the strings situated over
the finger-board a number of others running at the left side of
the finger-board which could not be shortened by the fingers, and
which produced the bass tones.The largest kinds of theorbo were the
_archlute_ and the _chitarrone_.It is unnecessary to enter here into a detailed description of some
other instruments which have been popular during the last three
centuries, for the museum at Kensington contains specimens of many
of them of which an account is given in the large catalogue of that
collection.It must suffice to refer the reader to the illustrations
there of the cither, virginal, spinet, clavichord, harpsichord, and
other antiquated instruments much esteemed by our forefathers.Students who examine these old relics will probably wish to know
something about their quality of tone.Might
they still be made effective in our present state of the art?” are
questions which naturally occur to the musical inquirer having such
instruments brought before him.A few words bearing on these questions
may therefore not be out of place here.[Illustration]

It is generally and justly admitted that in no other branch of the art
of music has greater progress been made since the last century than
in the construction of musical instruments.Nevertheless, there are
people who think that we have also lost something here which might
with advantage be restored.Our various instruments by being more and
more perfected are becoming too much alike in quality of sound, or in
that character of tone which the French call _timbre_, and the Germans
_Klangfarbe_, and which professor Tyndall in his lectures on sound has
translated _clang-tint_.Every musical composer knows how much more
suitable one _clang-tint_ is for the expression of a certain emotion
than another.Our old instruments, imperfect though they were in many
respects, possessed this variety of _clang-tint_ to a high degree.Neither were they on this account less capable of expression than the
modern ones.That no improvement has been made during the last two
centuries in instruments of the violin class is a well-known fact.As
to lutes and cithers the collection at Kensington contains specimens
so rich and mellow in tone as to cause musicians to regret that these
instruments have entirely fallen into oblivion.As regards beauty of appearance our earlier instruments were certainly
superior to the modern.Indeed, we have now scarcely a musical
instrument which can be called beautiful.The old lutes, spinets,
viols, dulcimers, &c., are not only elegant in shape but are also often
tastefully ornamented with carvings, designs in marquetry, and painting.[Illustration]

The player on the _viola da gamba_, shown in the next engraving, is
a reduced copy of an illustration in “The Division Violist,” London,
1659.It shows exactly how the frets were regulated, and how the bow
was held.The most popular instruments played with a bow, at that time,
were the _treble-viol_, the _tenor-viol_, and the _bass-viol_.It was
usual for viol players to have “a chest of viols,” a case containing
four or more viols, of different sizes.Thus, Thomas Mace in his
directions for the use of the viol, “Musick’s Monument” 1676, remarks,
“Your best provision, and most complete, will be a good chest of viols,
six in number, viz., two basses, two tenors, and two trebles, all truly
and proportionably suited.” The violist, to be properly furnished with
his requirements, had therefore to supply himself with a larger stock
of instruments than the violinist of the present day.[Illustration]

That there was, in the time of Shakespeare, a musical instrument
called _recorder_ is undoubtedly known to most readers from the stage
direction in Hamlet: _Re-enter players with recorders_.But not many
are likely to have ever seen a recorder, as it has now become very
scarce: we therefore give an illustration of this old instrument, which
is copied from “The Genteel Companion; Being exact Directions for the
Recorder: etc.” London, 1683.The _bagpipe_ appears to have been from time immemorial a special
favourite instrument with the Celtic races; but it was perhaps quite as
much admired by the Slavonic nations.In Poland, and in the Ukraine,
it used to be made of the whole skin of the goat in which the shape
of the animal, whenever the bagpipe was expanded with air, appeared
fully retained, exhibiting even the head with the horns; hence the
bagpipe was called _kosa_, which signifies a goat.120
represents a Scotch bagpipe of the last century.The bagpipe is of high antiquity in Ireland, and is alluded to in Irish
poetry and prose said to date from the tenth century.A pig gravely
engaged in playing the bagpipe is represented in an illuminated Irish
manuscript, of the year 1300: and we give p.121 a copy of a woodcut
from “The Image of Ireland,” a book printed in London in 1581.[Illustration]

The _bell_ has always been so much in popular favour in England that
some account of it must not be omitted.Paul Hentzner a German, who
visited England in the year 1598, records in his journal: “The people
are vastly fond of great noises that fill the ear, such as the firing
of cannon, drums, and the ringing of bells; so that in London it is
common for a number of them that have got a glass in their heads to go
up into some belfry, and ring the bells for hours together for the sake
of exercise.” This may be exaggeration,--not unusual with travellers.It is, however, a fact that bell-ringing has been a favourite amusement
with Englishmen for centuries.The way in which church bells are suspended and fastened, so as to
permit of their being made to vibrate in the most effective manner
without damaging by their vibration the building in which they are
placed, is in some countries very peculiar.The Italian _campanile_, or
tower of bells, is not unfrequently separated from the church itself.In Servia the church bells are often hung in a frame-work of timber
built near the west end of the church.In Zante and other islands of
Greece the belfry is usually separate from the church.The reason
assigned by the Greeks for having adopted this plan is that in case
of an earthquake the bells are likely to fall and, were they placed
in a tower, would destroy the roof of the church and might cause the
destruction of the whole building.Also in Russia a special edifice
for the bells is generally separate from the church.In the Russian
villages the bells are not unfrequently hung in the branches of an
oak-tree near the church.In Iceland the bell is usually placed in the
lych-gate leading to the graveyard.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The idea of forming of a number of bells a musical instrument such
as the _carillon_ is said by some to have suggested itself first to
the English and Dutch; but what we have seen in Asiatic countries
sufficiently refutes this.Moreover, not only the Romans employed
variously arranged and attuned bells, but also among the Etruscan
antiquities an instrument has been discovered which is constructed of
a number of bronze vessels placed in a row on a metal rod.Numerous
bells, varying in size and tone, have also been found in Etruscan
tombs.Among the later contrivances of this kind in European countries
the sets of bells suspended in a wooden frame, which we find in
mediæval illuminations, deserve notice.In the British museum is a
manuscript of the fourteenth century in which king David is depicted
holding in each hand a hammer with which he strikes upon bells of
different dimensions, suspended on a wooden stand.It may be supposed that the device of playing tunes by means of bells
merely swung by the hand is also of ancient date.In Lancashire each
of the ringers manages two bells, holding one in either hand.Thus, an
assemblage of seven ringers insures fourteen different tones; and as
each ringer may change his two notes by substituting two other bells if
required, even compositions with various modulations, and of a somewhat
intricate character, may be executed,--provided the ringers are good
timeists; for each has, of course, to take care to fall in with his
note, just as a member of the Russian horn band contributes his single
note whenever it occurs.Peal-ringing is another pastime of the kind which may be regarded as
pre-eminently national to England.The bells constituting a peal are
frequently of the number of eight, attuned to the diatonic scale.Also
peals of ten bells, and even of twelve, are occasionally formed.A
peculiar feature of peal-ringing is that the bells, which are provided
with clappers, are generally swung so forcibly as to raise the mouth
completely upwards.The largest peal, and one of the finest, is at
Exeter cathedral: another celebrated one is that of St.Margaret’s,
Leicester, which consists of ten bells.Peal-ringing is of an early
date in England; Egelric, abbot of Croyland, is recorded to have cast
about the year 960 a set of six bells.The _carillon_ (engraved on the opposite page) is especially popular
in the Netherlands and Belgium, but is also found in Germany, Italy,
and some other European countries.It is generally placed in the church
tower and also sometimes in other public edifices.The statement
repeated by several writers that the first carillon was invented in
the year 1481 in the town of Alost is not to be trusted, for the town
of Bruges claims to have possessed similar chimes in the year 1300.There are two kinds of carillons in use on the continent, viz.: clock
chimes, which are moved by machinery, like a self-acting barrel-organ;
and such as are provided with a set of keys, by means of which the
tunes are played by a musician.The carillon in the ‘Parochial-Kirche’
at Berlin, which is one of the finest in Germany, contains thirty-seven
bells; and is provided with a key-board for the hands and with a pedal,
which together place at the disposal of the performer a compass of
rather more than three octaves.The keys of the manual are metal rods
somewhat above a foot in length; and are pressed down with the palms of
the hand.The keys of the pedal are of wood; the instrument requires
not only great dexterity but also a considerable physical power.It
is astonishing how rapidly passages can be executed upon it by the
player, who is generally the organist of the church in which he acts as
_carilloneur_.When engaged in the last-named capacity he usually wears
leathern gloves to protect his fingers, as they are otherwise apt to
become ill fit for the more delicate treatment of the organ.The want of a contrivance in the _carillon_ for stopping the vibration
has the effect of making rapid passages, if heard near, sound as a
confused noise; only at some distance are they tolerable.It must be
remembered that the _carillon_ is intended especially to be heard from
a distance.Successions of tones which form a consonant chord, and
which have some duration, are evidently the most suitable for this
instrument.Indeed, every musical instrument possesses certain characteristics
which render it especially suitable for the production of some
particular effects.The invention of a new instrument of music has,
therefore, not unfrequently led to the adoption of new effects in
compositions.Take the pianoforte, which was invented in the beginning
of the eighteenth century, and which has now obtained so great a
popularity: its characteristics inspired our great composers to the
invention of effects, or expressions, which cannot be properly rendered
on any other instrument, however superior in some respects it may be to
the pianoforte.Thus also the improvements which have been made during
the present century in the construction of our brass instruments, and
the invention of several new brass instruments, have evidently been
not without influence upon the conceptions displayed in our modern
orchestral works.Imperfect though this essay may be it will probably have convinced
the reader that a reference to the history of the music of different
nations elucidates many facts illustrative of our own musical
instruments, which to the unprepared observer must appear misty and
impenetrable.In truth, it is with this study as with any other
scientific pursuit.The unassisted eye sees only faint nebulæ where
with the aid of the telescope bright stars are revealed.Al-Farabi, a great performer on the lute, 57

Transcriber's note:

Inconsistent punctuation and capitalization are as in the original.Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the
drama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and
enlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but
too seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former
ship-mates, and the old, old, stale "good things,"--these are more
fashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such
conversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they
grew.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and
perfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of
their time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I
fear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which
I prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if
the medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take
away the "combat," and leave the "ant"--ant-officers, as they do the
work of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their
combatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory
shaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it
may seem.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless
a true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to
prefer the army to the navy."Mere dandies," the reader may say, "whom
this grievance would affect;" but there is many a good man a dandy, and
no one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal
appearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his
face by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--
ornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as
the blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,
points out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even
the Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What
would the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?Didn't
the Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming
moustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance
to the smallest and most effeminate?Does it not even beget a certain
amount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor
make of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony
Trollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed
moustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to
call on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and
English ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--
admitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands
are the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in
favour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose
the best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy
should keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,
smooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable
to wear the moustache in good society.Those were the days of
cabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are
past and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge
under the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative
peace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the
cutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,
used, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell
in with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the
commander gave the order, "All hands to shave," never was such a
hurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to
be lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his
face with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,
to borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had
despatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both
stewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body
with their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with
which he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he
meant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating
knife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,
with bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--"Why,
sir," replied the bo'swain's mate, "the cockroaches have been and gone
and eaten all our razors, they has, sir."Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,
with our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on
every face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on
strike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that
trod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the
moustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy
took no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do
penance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any
other place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical
officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the
_young_ surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings.It
is only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use
the cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly.In some
ships, however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning.Again, it is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of
the first or second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the
most part the victims.I do not believe I shall ever forget the first exhibition of this sort I
attended on board my own ship; not that the spectacle was in any way
more revolting than scores I have since witnessed, but because the sight
was new to me.I remember it wanted fully twenty minutes of seven in the morning, when
my servant aroused me."A flaying match, you know, sir," said Jones.My heart gave an anxious "thud" against my ribs, as if I myself were to
form the "ram for the sacrifice."I hurried through with my bath, and,
dressing myself as if for a holiday, in cocked hat, sword, and undress
coat, I went on deck.All the
minutiae of the scene I remember as though it were but yesterday,
morning was cool and clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, seabirds
floating high in air, and the waters of the bay reflecting the line of
the sky and the lofty mountain-sides, forming a picture almost dreamlike
in its quietness and serenity.The men were standing about in groups,
dressed in their whitest of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of
black silk neckerchiefs.By-and-bye the culprit was led aft by a file
of marines, and I went below with him to make the preliminary
examination, in order to report whether or not he might be fit for the
punishment.He was as good a specimen of the British marine as one could wish to
look upon, hardy, bold, and wiry.His crime had been smuggling spirits
on board."Needn't examine me, Doctor," said he; "I ain't afeard of their four
dozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast
though; hum-m!"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he
bent down his eyes."What," said I, "have you anything the matter with your chest?""Nay, Doctor, nay; its my feelins they'll hurt.I've a little girl at
home that loves me, and--bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face
again no-how."No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery
had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath
the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of
an old seventy-four.I pitied the brave fellow, and--very wrong of me it was, but I could not
help it--filled out and offered him a large glass of rum.sir," he said, with a wistful eye on the ruby liquid, "don't tempt
me, sir.I can bear the bit o' flaying athout that: I wouldn't have my
messmates smell Dutch courage on my breath, sir; thankee all the same,
Doctor."All hands had already assembled, the men and boys on one side, and the
officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.A grating had been
lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck beside it.The
culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt fastened
around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then firmly
tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a
little basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now
prepared.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the
punishment.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not
use it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a
half long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the
thongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness
of a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the
first blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly
and determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,
and as unflinchingly received.Then, "One dozen, sir, please," he reported, saluting the commander."Continue the punishment," was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to
purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the
suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a
comrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still.""Her said her would, and I hope her will," answered the brother
despondently."Her's very seldom out; us can't get on at all without
she."This, and several more long and voluble speeches given in broad
Cornish, with the true Cornish confusion of pronouns, and with an air
of piteous perplexity--nay, abject helplessness, the usual helplessness
of man without woman--proved too much for our risible nerves.We
maintained a decorous gravity till we had driven away, and then fell
into shouts of laughter--the innocent laughter of happy-minded people
over the smallest joke or the mildest species of fun."Never mind, ladies, you'll get your tea all right.If Mary said she'd
be back at six, back she'll be.And you'll find a capital tea waiting
for you; there isn't a more comfortable inn in all Cornwall."Which, we afterwards found, was saying a great deal.Mullion Cove is a good mile from Mullion village, and as we jolted over
the rough road I was remorseful over both carriage and horse."Not at all, ma'am, he's used to it.Often and often he comes here with
pic-nic parties, all the way from Falmouth.I'll put him in at the
farm, and be down with you at the Cove directly.You'll find the rocks
pretty bad walking, but there's a cave which you ought to see.There was no resisting the way the kindly young Cornishman thus
identified himself with our interests, and gave himself all sorts
of extra trouble on our account.And when after a steep and not too
savoury descent--the cove being used as a fish cellar--we found
ourselves on the beach, shut in by those grand rocks of serpentine,
with Mullion Island lying ahead about a quarter of a mile off, we felt
we had not come here for nothing.The great feature of Mullion Cove is its sea-caves, of which there are
two, one on the beach, the other round the point, and only accessible
at low water.Now, we saw the tide was rising fast."They'll have to wade; I told them they would have to wade!"cried an
anxious voice behind me; and "I was ware," as ancient chroniclers say,
of the presence of another "old hen," the same whom we had noticed
conducting her brood of chickens, or ducklings--they seemed more like
the latter now--to bathe on Kennack Sands."Yes, they have been away more than half an hour, all my children
except this one"--a small boy who looked as if he wished he had gone
too."They would go, though I warned them they would have to wade.And
there they are, just going into the cave.One, two, three, four, five,
six," counting the black specks that were seen moving on, or rather in,
the water."Oh dear, they've _all_ gone in![Illustration: MULLION COVE, CORNWALL.]Nevertheless, in the midst of her distress, the benevolent lady stopped
to give me a helping hand into the near cave, a long, dark passage,
with light at either end.My girls had already safely threaded it and
come triumphantly out at the other side.But what with the darkness and
the uncertain footing over what felt like beds of damp seaweed, with
occasional stones, through which one had to grope every inch of one's
way, my heart rather misgave me, until I was cheered by the apparition
of the faithful Charles."Don't go back, ma'am, you'll be so sorry afterwards.I'll strike a
light and help you.Slow and steady, you'll come to no harm.And it's
beautiful when you get out at the other end."The most exquisite little nook; where you could have
imagined a mermaid came daily to comb her hair; one can easily believe
in mermaids or anything else in Cornwall.What a charming dressing-room
she would have, shut in on three sides by those great walls of
serpentine, and in front the glittering sea, rolling in upon a floor of
the loveliest silver sand.But the only mermaid there was an artist's wife, standing beside her
husband's easel, at which he was painting away so earnestly that he
scarcely noticed us.Very picturesque he looked, and she too, in her
rough serge dress, with her pretty bare feet and ankles, the shoes and
stockings lying in a corner as if they had not been worn for hours.they were quite unnecessary on those soft sands,
and their owner stood and talked with me as composedly as if it were
the height of the fashion to go barefoot.And far more than anything
concerning herself, she seemed interested in my evident interest in the
picture, which promised to be a remarkably good one, and which, if I
see it on the R. A. walls next year will furnish my only clue to the
identity of the couple, or theirs to mine.But the tide was fast advancing; they began to take down the easel, and
I remembered that the narrow winding cave was our only way out from
this rock-inclosed fairy paradise to the prosaic beach."Look, they are wading ashore up to the knees!And we shall have to
wade too if we don't make haste back."So cried the perplexed mother of the six too-adventurous ducklings.But mine, more considerate, answered me from the rocks where they were
scrambling, and helped me back through the cave into safe quarters,
where we stood watching the waders with mingled excitement and--envy?I can still recall the delicious sensation of paddling across the
smooth sea-sand, and of walking up the bed of a Highland burn.the change twixt Now and Then," I sat calmly on a stone, dry-shod; as
was best.Still, is it not a benign law of nature, that the things we
are no longer able to do, we almost cease to wish to do?Perhaps even
the last cessation of all things will come naturally at the end, as
naturally as we turn round and go to sleep at night?I am proud to think how high and steep was
the cliff we re-ascended, all three of us, and from which we stood
and looked at sky and sea.Such a sea and such a sky: amber clear, so
that one could trace the whole line of coast--Mount's Bay, with St.Michael's Mount dotted in the midst of it, and even the Land's End,
beyond which the sun, round and red, was just touching the top of the
waves.We should have liked to watch him drop below them--that splendid
sea-sunset of which one never tires, but we had some distance to walk,
and we began to rejoice in the prospect of Mary Mundy's tea."I'll go on ahead and have the carriage ready," said the ever
thoughtful Charles."You can't miss your way, ladies.Just follow the
hedges"--that tempting aerial promenade, to which we were now getting
accustomed, becoming veritable Blondins in petticoats--"then cross the
cornfield; and take to the hedges again.You'll be at the farm-yard
directly."Not quite--for we lingered, tempted by the abundance of corn-flowers,
of which we gathered, not handfuls but armfuls.When we reached
it, what a picture of an English farm-yard it was!With a regular
old-fashioned English milk-maid--such as Izaak Walton would have loved
to describe--sitting amidst her shining pails, her cows standing round
her, meekly waiting their turn.Sleek, calm creatures they were,
Juno-eyed and soft-skinned--of that peculiar shade of grey which I
have seen only in Cornwall.And, being rather a connoisseur in cows,
I have often amused myself to notice how the kine of each country
have their own predominant colour, which seems to harmonise with its
special landscape.The curious yellow tint of Highland cattle, the red,
white, or brown of those of the midland counties, and the delicate
grey of Cornish cows, alike suit the scene around them, and belong to
it as completely as the dainty little Swiss herds do to their Alpine
pastures, or the large, mild, cream- oxen to the Campagna at
Rome.But we had to tear ourselves away from this Arcadia, for in the midst
of the farm-yard appeared the carriage and Charles.So we jolted
back--it seemed as if Cornish carriages and horses could go anywhere
and over everything--to the Old Inn and Mary Mundy.She _had_ come home, and everything was right.As we soon found,
everything and everybody was accustomed to be put to rights by Miss
Mary Mundy.She stood at the door to greet us--a bright, brown-faced little
woman with the reddest of cheeks and the blackest of eyes; I have no
hesitation in painting her portrait here, as she is, so to speak,
public property, known and respected far and wide.[Illustration: A CRABBER'S HOLE, GERRAN'S BAY.]"Delighted to see you, ladies; delighted to see any friends of the
Professor's; and I hope you enjoyed the Cove, and that you're all
hungry, and will find your tea to your liking.It's the best we can do;
we're very homely folk here, but we try to make people comfortable,"
and so on and so on, a regular stream of chatty conversation, given in
the strongest Cornish, with the kindliest of Cornish hearts, as she
ushered us into a neat little parlour at the back of the inn.There lay spread, not one of your dainty afternoon teas, with two or
three wafery slices of bread and butter, but a regular substantial
meal.Cheerful candles--of course in serpentine candlesticks--were
already lit, and showed us the bright teapot full of that welcome drink
to weary travellers, hot, strong and harmless; the gigantic home-baked
loaf, which it seemed sacrilegious to have turned into toast; the rich,
yellow butter--I am sure those lovely cows had something to do with
it, and also with the cream, so thick that the spoon could almost have
stood upright in it.Besides, there was a quantity of that delicious
clotted cream, which here accompanies every meal and of which I had
vainly tried to get the receipt, but was answered with polite scorn,
"Oh, ma'am, it would be of no use to _you_: Cornish cream can only be
made from Cornish cows!"Whether this remarkable fact in natural history be true or not, let me
record the perfection of Mary Mundy's cream, which, together with her
jam and her marmalade, was a refection worthy of the gods.She pressed us again and again to "have some more," and her charge for
our magnificent meal was as small as her gratitude was great for the
slight addition we made to it."No, I'll not say no, ma'am, it'll come in handy; us has got a young
niece to bring up--my brother and me--please'm.Yes, I'm glad you came,
and I hope you'll come again, please'm.And if you see the Professor,
you'll tell him he's not forgotten, please'm."This garniture of "please'm" at the end of every sentence reminded
us of the Venetian "probbedirla," _per ubbedirla_, with which our
gondolier Giovanna used to amuse us, often dragging it in in the oddest
way."Yes, the Signora will get a beautiful day, probbedirla," or "My
wife has just lost her baby, probbedirla."Mary Mundy's "please'm"
often came in with equal incongruity, and her voluble tongue ran on
nineteen to the dozen; but her talk was so shrewd and her looks so
pleasant--once, no doubt, actually pretty, and still comely enough for
a middle-aged woman--that we departed, fully agreeing with her admiring
Professor that

  "The brightest thing on Cornish land
  Is the face of Miss Mary Mundy."Recrossing Pradenack down in the dim light of a newly-risen moon,
everything looked so solitary and ghostly that we started to see moving
from behind a furz-bush, a mysterious figure, which crossed the road
slowly, and stood waiting for us.Was it man or ghost, or--

Only a donkey!It might have been Tregeagle
himself--Tregeagle, the grim mad-demon of Cornish tradition, once a
dishonest steward, who sold his soul to the devil, and is doomed to
keep on emptying Dozmare Pool, near St.Neots (the same mere wherein
Excalibur was thrown), with a limpet-shell; and to spend his nights in
other secluded places balancing interminable accounts, which are always
just sixpence wrong.I fear some of us, weak in arithmetic, had a secret
sympathy for him!But we never met him--nor anything worse than that
spectral donkey, looming large and placid against the level horizon.Soon, "the stars came out by twos and threes,"--promising a fine night
and finer morning, during which, while we were comfortably asleep,
our good horse and man would be driving across this lonely region to
Falmouth, in time to take the good people to church on Sunday morning."And we'll do it, too--don't you be anxious about us, ladies," insisted
Charles."I'll feed him well, and groom him well.I likes to take care
of a good horse, and you'll see, he'll take no harm.I'll be back when
you want me, at the week's end, or perhaps before then, with some party
or other--we're always coming to the Lizard--and I'll just look in and
see how you're getting on, and how you liked Kynance.We thanked our kindly charioteer, bade him and his horse good-bye,
wished him a pleasant journey through the moonlight, which was every
minute growing more beautiful, then went indoors to supper--no!supper
would have been an insult to Mary Mundy's tea--to bed.DAY THE FOURTH


Sunday, September 4th--and we had started on September 1st; was it
possible we had only been travelling four days?We had seen so much, taken in so many
new interests--nay, made several new friends.Already we began to plan
another meeting with John Curgenven, who we found was a relation of
our landlady, or of our bright-faced serving maiden, Esther--I forget
which.But everybody seemed connected with everybody at the Lizard,
and everybody took a friendly interest in everybody.The arrival of
new lodgers in the "genteel" parlour which we had not appreciated
was important information, and we were glad to hear that Charles had
started about four in the morning quite cheery.And what a morning it was!--a typical Sabbath, a day of rest, a day
to rejoice in.Strolling round the garden at eight o'clock, while the
dew still lay thick on the grass, and glittered like diamonds on the
autumnal spider-webs, even the flowers seemed to know it was Sunday,
the mignonette bed to smell sweeter, the marigolds--yes!aesthetic
fashion is right in its love for marigolds--burnt in a perfect blaze
of golden colour and aromatic scent.The air was so mild that we could
imagine summer was still with us: and the great wide circle of sea
gleamed in the sunshine as if there never had been, never could be,
such a thing as cloud or storm.Having ascertained that there was no service nearer than Grade, some
miles off, until the afternoon, we "went to church" on the cliffs, in
Pistol Meadow, beside the green mounds where the two hundred drowned
sailors sleep in peace.[Illustration: STEAM SEINE BOATS GOING OUT.]Absolutely solitary: not a living creature,
not even a sheep came near me the whole morning:--and in the silence
I could hear almost every word said by my young folks, searching for
sea-treasures among the rocks and little pools far below.Westwards
towards Kynance, and eastwards towards Landewednack--the church we were
to go to in the afternoon--the cliff path was smooth and green, the
short grass full of those curious dainty flowers, some of which were
new to our eager eyes.At other times the road was so precipitous that
we did not wonder at those carefully white-washed stones every few
yards, which are the sole guide to the coastguard men of dark nights.Even in daylight, if the wind were high, or the footing slippery with
rain, the cliff-walk from the Lizard to Kynance would be no joke to
uninitiated feet.Now, all was so still that the wind never once fluttered the letter I
was writing, and so warm that we were glad to escape the white glare of
the wall of the Lizard Lights and sit in a cool hollow, watching sky
and ocean, with now and then a sea-bird floating lazily between, a dark
speck on the perpetual blue."If it will only keep like this all week!"And, as we sat, we planned
out each day, so as to miss nothing, and lose nothing--either of time
or strength: doing enough, but never too much--as is often the fatal
mistake of tourists.And then, following the grand law of travelling,
to have one's "meals reg'lar"--we went indoors and dined.Afterwards in
honour of the day

        "that comes between
  The Saturday and Monday,"

we dressed ourselves in all our best--very humble best it was!--to join
the good people going to church at Landewednack.This, which in ancient Cornish means "the white-roofed church of St.Wednack"--hagiologists must decide who that individual was!--is the
name of the parish to which the comparatively modern Lizard Town
belongs.The church is in a very picturesque corner, close to the sea,
though both it and the rectory are protected by a sudden dip in the
ground, so that you see neither till you are close upon them.A fine
Norman doorway, a curious hagioscope, and other points, interesting to
archaeologists--also the neatest and prettiest of churchyards--make
note-worthy this, the most southerly church in England.A fine old
building, not spoiled though "restored."The modern open pews, and a
modern memorial pulpit of serpentine, jarred less than might have been
expected with the carefully-preserved remains of the past.In Landewednack church is said to have been preached the last sermon in
Cornish.Since, the ancient tongue has completely
died out, and the people of King Arthur's country have become wholly
English.Still, they are not the English of the midland and northern districts,
but of a very different type and race.I have heard it said that a
seaboard population, accustomed to wrestle with the dangers of the
coast, to move about from place to place, see foreign countries, and
carry on its business in the deep waters, is always more capable, more
intelligent, as a whole, than an inland people, whether agricultural
or manufacturing.It may be so: but certainly the aborigines of
Lizard Town, who could easily be distinguished from the visitors--of
whom there was yet a tolerable sprinkling--made a very interesting
congregation; orderly, respectable, reverent; simple in dress and
manner, yet many of them, both the men and women, exceedingly
picturesque.That is, the old men and the old women: the younger ones
aped modern fashion even here, in this out-of-the-way corner, and
consequently did not look half so well as their seniors.I must name one more member of the congregation--a large black dog,
who walked in and settled himself in the pew behind, where he behaved
during half the service in an exemplary manner, worthy of the Highland
shepherds' dogs, who always come to church with their masters, and
conduct themselves with equal decorum.There is always a certain pathos in going in to worship in a strange
church, with a strange congregation, of whom you are as ignorant as
they of you.In the intervals of kneeling with them as "miserable
sinners," one finds oneself speculating upon them, their possible
faults and virtues, joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, watching the
unknown faces, and trying to read thereon the records of a common
humanity.A silent homily, better perhaps than most sermons.Not that there was aught to complain of in the sermon, and the singing
was especially good.Many a London choir might have taken a lesson from
this village church at the far end of Cornwall.When service was over,
we lingered in the pretty and carefully tended churchyard, where the
evening light fell softly upon many curious gravestones, of seafaring
men, and a few of wrecked sailors--only a few, since it is but within
a generation that bodies washed ashore from the deep were allowed to
be buried in consecrated ground; most of them, like the two hundred in
Pistol Meadow, being interred as near as convenient to where they were
found, without any burial rites.Still, in all the churchyards along
this coast are graves with a story.A little corner railed off has an
old and sad one.There lie buried the victims of the plague, which in
1645 devastated the village.No one since has ever ventured to disturb
their resting-place.Very green and peaceful the churchyard looked: the beautiful day was
dying, beautiful to the last.We stood and watched the congregation
melt slowly away, disappearing down the lane, and then, attracted by
the sound of music, we re-entered the church.There we sat and listened
for another half-hour to the practising of an anthem ready for the
harvest festival, which had been announced for the following Tuesday;
exceedingly well done too, the rector's voice leading it all, with an
energy and enthusiasm that at once accounted for the capital condition
of the choir.was our earnest sigh as we walked
home; and anxious not to lose a minute of it, we gave ourselves the
briefest rest, and turned out again, I to watch the sunset from the
cliffs, while the others descended once more to their beloved sea-pools."Such anemones, such sea-weed!Besides,
sunsets are all alike," added the youthful, practical, and slightly
unpoetical mind.Every one has a mysterious charm of its
own--just like that in every new human face.I have seen hundreds of
sunsets in my time, and those I shall see are narrowing down now, but
I think to the end of my life I shall always feel a day incomplete of
which I did not see the sunset.The usual place where the sun dropped into the
sea, just beyond the point of the Land's End, was all a golden mist.I hastened west, climbing one intervening cliff after the other,
anxious not to miss the clear sight of him as he set his glowing
feet, or rather his great round disc, on the sea.At last I found a
"comfortable" stone, sheltered from the wind, which blew tolerably
fresh, and utterly solitary (as I thought), the intense silence
being such that one could almost hear the cropping of three placid
sheep--evidently well accustomed to sunsets, and thinking them of
little consequence.There I sat until the last red spark had gone out, quenched in the
Atlantic waters, and from behind the vanished sun sprung a gleam of
absolutely green light, "like a firework out of a rocket," the young
people said; such as I had never seen before, though we saw it once
afterwards.Nature's fireworks they were; and I could see even the two
little black figures moving along the rocks below stand still to watch
them.I watched too, with that sort of lonely delight--the one shadow
upon it being that it is so lonely--with which all one's life one is
accustomed to watch beautiful and vanishing things.Then seeing how
fast the colours were fading and the sky darkening, I rose; but just
took a step or two farther to look over the edge of my stone into the
next dip of the cliff, and there I saw--

[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS--EVENING.]Nothing else would have
sat so long and so silently, for I had been within three yards of them
all the time, and had never discovered them, nor they me.They sat, quite absorbed in
one another, hand in hand, looking quietly seaward, their faces bathed
in the rosy sunset--which to them was a sunrise, the sort of sun which
never rises twice in a life-time.Evidently they did not see me, in fact I just
peered over the rock's edge and drew back again; any slight sound they
probably attributed to the harmless sheep.Well, it was but an equally
harmless old woman, who did not laugh at them, as some might have done,
but smiled and wished them well, as she left them to their sunset, and
turned to face the darkening east, where the sun would rise to-morrow.The moon was rising there now, and it was a picture to behold.Indeed,
all these Cornish days seemed so full of moonrises and sunsets--and
sunrises too--that it was really inconvenient.Going to bed seemed
almost a sin--as on this night, when, opening our parlour door, which
looked right on to the garden, we saw the whole world lying in a flood
of moonlight peace, the marigolds and carnations leaning cheek to
cheek, as motionless as the two young lovers on the cliff.must long ago have had their dream broken, for five minutes afterwards
I had met a most respectable fat couple from Lizard Town taking their
Sunday evening stroll, in all their Sunday best, along those very
cliffs.But perhaps, the good folks had once
been lovers too.How the stars
shone, without a mist or a cloud; how the Lizard Lights gleamed, even
in spite of the moonlight, and how clear showed the black outline of
Kynance Cove, from which came through the silence a dull murmur of
waves!It was, as we declared, a sin and a shame to go to bed at all
though we had been out the whole day, and hoped to be out the whole of
to-morrow.Still, human nature could not keep awake for ever.We passed
from the poetical to the practical, and decided to lay us down and
sleep.But, in the middle of the night I woke, rose, and looked out of the
window.Sea and sky were one blackness, literally as "black as
ink," and melting into one another so that both were undistinguishable.As for the moon and stars--heaven knows where they had gone to, for
they seemed utterly blotted out.The only light visible was the ghostly
gleam of those two great eyes, the Lizard Lights, stretching far out
into the intense darkness.I never saw such darkness--unbroken even by
the white crest of a wave.And the stillness was like the stillness of
death, with a heavy weight in the air which made me involuntarily go
to sleep again, though with an awed impression of "something going to
happen."And sure enough in another hour something did happen.I started awake,
feeling as if a volley of artillery had been poured in at my window.It was the wildest deluge of rain, beating against the panes, and with
it came a wind that howled and shrieked round the house as if all the
demons in Cornwall, Tregeagle himself included, were let loose at once.Now we understood what a Lizard storm could be.I have seen
Mediterranean storms, sweeping across the Campagna like armed
battalions of avenging angels, pouring out their vials of wrath--rain,
hail, thunder, and lightning--unceasingly for two whole days.I have
been in Highland storms, so furious that one had to sit down in the
middle of the road with one's plaid over one's head, till the worst of
their rage was spent.But I never saw or heard anything more awful than
this Lizard storm, to which I lay and listened till the day began to
dawn.Then the wind lulled a little, but the rain still fell in torrents,
and the sky and sea were as black as ever.The weather had evidently
broken for good--that is, for evil.the harvest, and the harvest
festival!And alas--of minor importance, but still some, to us at
least--alas for our holiday in Cornwall!It was with a heavy heart that, feeling there was not the slightest use
in getting up, I turned round and took another sleep.DAY THE FIFTH


"Hope for the best, and be prepared for the worst," had been the motto
of our journey.So when we rose to one of the wettest mornings that
ever came out of the sky, there was a certain satisfaction in being
prepared for it."We must have a fire, that is certain," was our first decision.This
entailed the abolition of our beautiful decorations--our sea-holly
and ferns; also some anxious looks from our handmaiden.Apparently no
fire, had been lit in this rather despised room for many months--years
perhaps--and the chimney rather resented being used.A few agonised
down-puffs greatly interfered with the comfort of the breakfast table,
and an insane attempt to open the windows made matters worse.Which was most preferable--to be stifled or deluged?We were just
considering the question, when the chimney took a new and kinder
thought, or the wind took a turn--it seemed to blow alternately from
every quarter, and then from all quarters at once--the smoke went up
straight, the room grew warm and bright, with the cosy peace of the
first fire of the season.Existence became once more endurable, nay,
pleasant."We shall survive, spite of the rain!"And we began to laugh over our
lost day which we had meant to begin by bathing in Housel Cove; truly,
just to stand outside the door would give an admirable douche bath in
three minutes."But how nice it is to be inside, with a roof over our
heads, and no necessity for travelling.Fancy the unfortunate tourists
who have fixed on to-day for visiting the Lizard!"(Charles had told us
that Monday was a favourite day for excursions.)"Fancy anybody being
obliged to go out such weather as this!"And in our deep pity for our fellow-creatures we forgot to pity
ourselves.Nor was there much pity needed; we had provided against emergencies,
with a good store of needlework and knitting, anything that would
pack in small compass, also a stock of unquestionably "light"
literature--paper-covered, double-columned, sixpenny volumes, inclosing
an amount of enjoyment which those only can understand who are true
lovers of Walter Scott.We had enough of him to last for a week of wet
days.And we had a one-volume Tennyson, all complete, and a "Morte
d'Arthur"--Sir Thomas Malory's.On this literary provender we felt that
as yet we should not starve.Also, some little fingers having a trifling turn for art, brought out
triumphantly a colour-box, pencils, and pictures.And the wall-paper
being one of the very ugliest that ever eye beheld, we sought and
obtained permission to adorn it with these, our _chefs-d'[oe]uvre_,
pasted at regular intervals.Where we hope they still remain, for the
edification of succeeding lodgers.We read the "Idylls of the King" all through, finishing with "The
Passing of Arthur," where the "bold Sir Bedivere" threw Excalibur into
the mere--which is supposed to be Dozmare Pool.Here King Arthur's
faithful lover was so melted--for the hundredth time--by the pathos
of the story, and by many old associations, that the younger and
more practical minds grew scornful, and declared that probably King
Arthur had never existed at all--or if he had, was nothing but a rough
barbarian, unlike even the hero of Sir Thomas Malory, and far more
unlike the noble modern gentleman of Tennyson's verse.Maybe: and yet,
seeing that

  "'Tis better to have loved and lost
  Than never to have loved at all,"

may it not be better to have believed in an impossible ideal man, than
to accept contentedly a low ideal, and worship blindly the worldly, the
mean, or the base?This topic furnished matter for so much hot argument, that, besides
doing a quantity of needlework, we succeeded in making our one wet day
by no means the least amusing of our seventeen days in Cornwall.[Illustration: HAULING IN THE LINES.]Hour after hour we watched the rain--an even down-pour.In the midst
of it we heard a rumour that Charles had been seen about the town, and
soon after he appeared at the door, hat in hand, soaked but smiling,
to inquire for and sympathise with his ladies.Yes, he _had_ brought a
party to the Lizard that day!--unfortunate souls (or bodies), for there
could not have been a dry thread left on them!We gathered closer round
our cosy fire; ate our simple dinner with keen enjoyment, and agreed
that after all we had much to be thankful for.In the afternoon the storm abated a little, and we thought we would
seize the chance of doing some shopping, if there was a shop in Lizard
Town.So we walked--I ought rather to say waded, for the road was
literally swimming--meeting not one living creature, except a family of
young ducks, who, I need scarcely say, were enjoying supreme felicity."Yes, ladies, this is the sort of weather we have pretty well all
winter.Very little frost or snow, but rain and storm, and plenty of
it.Also fogs; I've heard there's nothing anywhere like the fogs at the
Lizard."So said the woman at the post-office, which, except the serpentine
shops, seemed to be the one emporium of commerce in the place.There we
could get all we wanted, and a good deal that we were very thankful we
did not want, of eatables, drinkables, and wearables.Also ornaments,
china vases, &c., of a kind that would have driven frantic any person
of aesthetic tastes.Among them an active young Cornishman of about a
year old was meandering aimlessly, or with aims equally destructive
to himself and the community.He all but succeeded in bringing down a
row of plates upon his devoted head, and then tied himself up, one fat
finger after another, in a ball of twine, upon which he began to howl
violently."He's a regular little trial," said the young mother proudly."He's
only sixteen months old, and yet he's up to all sorts of mischief.I
don't know what in the world I shall do with he, presently."Not naughty, only active," suggested another maternal spirit, and
pleaded that the young jackanapes should be found something to do that
was not mischief, but yet would occupy his energies, and fill his mind.At which, the bright bold face looked up as if he had understood it
all--an absolutely fearless face, brimming with fun, and shrewdness
too.The "regular little trial" may grow into a valuable
member of society--fisherman, sailor, coastguardman--daring and doing
heroic deeds; perhaps saving many a life on nights such as last night,
which had taught us what Cornish coast-life was all winter through.The storm was now gradually abating; the wind had lulled entirely, the
rain had ceased, and by sunset a broad yellow streak all along the west
implied that it might possibly be a fine day to-morrow.But the lane was almost a river still, and the slippery altitudes of
the "hedges" were anything but desirable.As the only possible place
for a walk I ventured into a field where two or three cows cropped
their supper of damp grass round one of those green hillocks seen in
every Cornish pasture field--a manure heap planted with cabbages, which
grow there with a luxuriance that turns ugliness into positive beauty.Very dreary everything was--the soaking grass, the leaden sky, the
angry-looking sea, over which a rainy moon was just beginning to throw
a faint glimmer; while shorewards one could just trace the outline of
Lizard Point and the wheat-field behind it.Yesterday those fields had
looked so sunshiny and fair, but to-night they were all dull and grey,
with rows of black dots indicating the soppy, sodden harvest sheaves.Which reminded me that to-morrow was the harvest festival at
Landewednack, when all the world and his wife was invited by shilling
tickets to have tea in the rectory garden, and afterwards to assist at
the evening thanksgiving service in the church.some poor farmer might well exclaim,
especially on such a day as this.Some harvest festivals must
occasionally seem a bitter mockery.Indeed, I doubt if the next
generation will not be wise in taking our "Prayers for Rain,"
"Prayers for Fair Weather," clean out of the liturgy.Such conceited
intermeddling with the government of the world sounds to some
ridiculous, to others actually profane."Snow and hail, mists and
vapours, wind and storm, fulfilling His Word."And it must be
fulfilled, no matter at what cost to individuals or to nations.The
laws of the universe must be carried out, even though the mystery
of sorrow, like the still greater mystery of evil, remains for ever
unexplained."Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"How marvellously beautiful He can make this
world!until we can hardly imagine anything more beautiful in the world
everlasting.Ay, even after such a day as to-day, when the world seems
hardly worth living in, yet we live on, live to wake up unto such a
to-morrow--

But I must wait to speak of it in another page.DAY THE SIXTH


And a day absolutely divine!Not a cloud upon the sky, not a ripple
upon the water, or it appeared so in the distance.Nearer, no doubt,
there would have been that heavy ground-swell which is so long in
subsiding, in fact is scarcely ever absent on this coast.The land,
like the sea, was all one smile; the pasture fields shone in brilliant
green, the cornfields gleaming yellow--at once a beauty and a
thanksgiving.It was the very perfection of an autumn morning.We would not lose
an hour of it, but directly after breakfast started leisurely to
find Housel Cove and try our first experiment of bathing in the wide
Atlantic.Not a rood of land lay between us and
America.Yet the illimitable ocean "where the great ships go down,"
rolled in to our feet in baby ripples, disporting itself harmlessly,
and tempting my two little mermaids to swim out to the utmost limit
that prudence allowed.And how delightful it was to run back barefoot
across the soft sand to the beautiful dressing-room of serpentine
rock, where one could sit and watch the glittering sea, untroubled by
any company save the gulls and cormorants.What a contrast to other
bathing places--genteel Eastbourne and Brighton, or vulgar Margate and
Ramsgate, where, nevertheless, the good folks look equally happy.Shall we stamp ourselves
as persons of little mind, easily satisfied, if I confess that we
spent the whole morning in Housel Cove without band or promenade,
without even a Christy Minstrel or a Punch and Judy, our sole amusement
being the vain attempt to catch a tiny fish, the Robinson Crusoe of
a small pool in the rock above high-water mark, where by some ill
chance he found himself.But he looked extremely contented with his
sea hermitage, and evaded so cleverly all our efforts to get hold of
him, that after a while we left him to his solitude--where possibly he
resides still.[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY DAY.]How delicious it is for hard-worked people to do nothing, absolutely
nothing!Of course only for a little while--a few days, a few hours.The love of work and the necessity for it soon revive.But just for
those few harmless hours to let the world and its duties and cares
alike slip by, to be absolutely idle, to fold one's hands and look
at the sea and the sky, thinking of nothing at all, except perhaps
to count and watch for every ninth wave--said to be the biggest
always--and wonder how big it will be, and whether it will reach that
stone with the little colony of limpets and two red anemones beside
them, or stop short at the rock where we sit placidly dangling our
feet, waiting, Canute-like, for the supreme moment when the will of
humanity sinks conquered by the immutable powers of nature.Then,
greatest crisis of all, the sea will attack that magnificent castle and
moat, which we grown-up babies have constructed with such pride.Well,
have we not all built our sand-castles and seen them swept away?happy
if by no unkinder force than the remorseless wave of Time, which will
soon flow over us all.But how foolish is moralising--making my narrative halt like that horse
whom we amused ourselves with half the afternoon.He was tied by the
leg, poor beast, the fore leg fastened to the hind one, as seemed to be
the ordinary Cornish fashion with all animals--horses, cows, and sheep.It certainly saves a deal of trouble, preventing them from climbing the
"hedges" which form the sole boundary of property, but it makes the
creatures go limping about in rather a melancholy fashion.However,
as it is their normal condition, probably they communicate it to one
another, and each generation accepts its lot.He was a handsome animal, who came and peered at
the sketch which one of us was doing, after the solemn fashion of
quadrupedal connoisseurship, and kept us company all the afternoon.We
sat in a row on the top of the "hedge," enjoying the golden afternoon,
and scarcely believing it possible that yesterday had been yesterday.Of the wild storm and deluge of rain there was not a single trace;
everything looked as lovely as if it had been, and was going to be,
summer all the year.We were so contented, and were making such progress in our sketch and
distant view of Kynance over the now dry and smiling cornfield, that we
had nigh forgotten the duties of civilisation, until some one brought
the news that all the household was apparently dressing itself in its
very best, to attend the rectory tea.We determined to do the same,
though small were our possibilities of toilette."Nobody knows us, and we know
nobody."A position rather rare to those who "dwell among their own people,"
who take a kindly interest in everybody, and believe with a pardonable
credulity that everybody takes a kindly interest in them.But human nature is the same all the world over.And here we saw it in
its pleasantest phase; rich and poor meeting together, not for charity,
but courtesy--a courtesy that was given with a kindliness and accepted
with a quiet independence which seemed characteristic of these Cornish
folk.Among the little crowd, gentle and simple, we, of course, did not know
a single soul.Nevertheless, delivering up our tickets to the gardener
at the gate, we entered, and wandered at ease through the pretty
garden, gorgeous with asters, marigolds, carnations, and all sorts of
rich- and rich-scented autumn flowers; where the hydrangeas
grew in enormous bushes, and the fuchsias had stems as thick and solid
as trees.In front of the open hall door was a gravel sweep where were ranged
two long tea-tables filled with the humbler but respectable class of
parishioners, chiefly elderly people, and some very old.The Lizard is
a place noted for longevity, as is proved by the register books, where
several deaths at over a hundred may be found recorded, and one--he was
the rector of Landewednack in 1683--is said to have died at the age of
120 years.The present rector is no such Methuselah.He moved actively to and fro
among his people, and so did his wife, whom we should have recognised
by her omnipresent kindliness, even if she had not come and welcomed
us strangers--easily singled out as strangers, where all the rest were
friends.Besides the poor and the aged, there was a goodly number of guests
who were neither the one nor the other, playing energetically at
lawn-tennis behind the house, on a "lawn" composed of sea-sand.All
seemed determined to amuse themselves and everybody else, and all did
their very best--including the band.I would fain pass it over in silence (would it
had returned the compliment!); but truth is truth, and may benefit
rather than harm.The calm composure with which those half-dozen
wind-instruments sat in a row, playing determinedly flat, bass coming
in with a tremendous boom here and there, entirely at his own volition,
without regard to time or tune, was the most awful thing I ever heard
in music!Agony, pure and simple, was the only sensation it produced.When they struck up, we just ran away till the tune was ended--what
tune, familiar or unfamiliar, it was impossible to say.Between us
three, all blessed, or cursed, with musical ears, there existed such
difference of opinion on this head, that decision became vain.And
when at last, as the hour of service approached, little groups began
strolling towards the church, the musicians began a final "God save the
Queen," barely recognisable, a feeling of thankfulness was the only
sensation left.[Illustration: THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER--A CORNISH STUDY.]Now, let me not be hard upon these village Orpheuses.They did their
best, and for a working man to study music in any form is a good and
desirable thing.But whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing
well.The great bane of provincial life is that people have so few
opportunities of finding out when they do _not_ do things well, and so
little ambition to learn to do them better.If these few severe remarks
should spur on that anonymous band to try and emulate the Philharmonic
or the Crystal Palace orchestra, it will be all the better for the
little community at the Lizard.A crowded congregation--not a
seat vacant--listened to the excellent chanting, hymns, and a harvest
anthem, most accurately and correctly sung.The organist too--it was
a pleasure to watch that young man's face and see with what interest
and enthusiasm he entered into it all.Besides the rector, there were
several other clergymen, one of whom, an old man, read the prayers
with an intonation and expression which I have rarely heard equalled,
and another preached what would have been called anywhere a thoroughly
good sermon.All the statelier guests at the Rectory tea--probably
county families (one stout lady had the dignity of a duchess at
least)--"assisted" at this evening service, and behind them was a
throng of humbler folk, among whom we recognised our sole friend here,
John Curgenven.We had passed him at the church door, and he had lifted
his hat with the air of a _preux chevalier_ of the olden time; "more
like King Arthur than ever"--we observed to one another.He, and we, and the aristocratic groups, with a few more of the
congregation, lingered for several minutes after service was over,
admiring the beautiful flowers and fruit.I think I never saw any
decorations so rich or so tasteful.And then, as the organ played us
out with an exceedingly brilliant voluntary, the vision of light and
colour melted away, and we came out upon the quiet churchyard, lying in
the cold, still moonlight.Clear as day, the round silver orb sailing
through a cloudless sky of that deep dark which we know is blue, only
moonlight shows no colours.Oh, Lady Moon, Lady Moon, what a dangerous
night for some of those groups to go walking home in!We saw them in
twos and threes, various young people whom we had got to know by sight,
and criticise, and take an interest in, wandering slowly on through
Lizard Town, and then diverging into quieter paths.For there, in an open space near the two hotels
which co-exist close together--I hope amicably, and divide the tourist
custom of the place--in front of a row of open windows which showed the
remains of a _table d'hote_, and playing lively tunes to a group of
delighted listeners, including some children, who had struck up a merry
dance--stood that terrible wind band!All our sympathy with our fellow-creatures, our
pleasure in watching them enjoy themselves, our interest in studying
human nature in the abstract, nay, even the picturesqueness of the
charming moonlight scene, could not tempt us to stay.We paused a
minute, then put our fingers in our ears and fled.Gradually those
fearful sounds melted away into distance, and left us to the silence of
moonshine, and the sight, now grown familiar, but never less beautiful,
of the far-gleaming Lizard Lights.DAY THE SEVENTH


John Curgenven had said last night, with his air of tender patronising,
half regal, half paternal, which we declared always reminded us of King
Arthur--"Ladies, whenever you settle to go to Kynance, I'll take you."And sure enough there he stood, at eight in the morning, quite a
picture, his cap in one hand, a couple of fishes dangling from the
other--he had brought them as a present, and absolutely refused to be
paid--smiling upon us at our breakfast, as benignly as did the sun.He
came to say that he was at our service till 10 A.M.We did not like venturing in strange and
dangerous ground, or rather sea, without our protector.But this was
our last chance, and such a lovely day."You won't come to any harm, ladies," said the consoling John."I'll
take you by a short cut across the down, much better than the cliff.You can't possibly miss your way: it'll lead you straight to Kynance,
and then you go down a steep path to the Cove.You'll have plenty of
time before the tide comes in to see everything.""Oh yes, miss, there's the Drawing-room, the Dining-room, and the
Kitchen--all capital caves close together; I wouldn't advise you to
swim out far, though.And keep a sharp look out for the tide--it runs
in pretty fast.""Oh, you can easy get on Asparagus Island, miss; it's quite safe.Only
don't try the Devil's Throat--or Hell's Mouth, as some folk call it."Neither name was inviting; but studying our guide-books, we thought we
could manage even without our friend.So, long ere the dew was dried on
the sunshiny down, we all started off together, Curgenven slackening
his quick active steps--very light and most enviably active for a man
of his years--to accommodate us, and conversing courteously with us all
the way.[Illustration: KYNANCE COVE, CORNWALL.]"Ower the muir amang the heather" have I tramped many a mile in
bonnie Scotland, but this Cornish moor and Cornish heather were quite
different.As different as the Cornishman with his bright, frank face,
and his mixture of British honesty and Gallic courtesy, from the Scotch
peasant--equally worthy, but sometimes just a trifle "dour."John had plenty to say for himself, and said it well, with a quiet
independence that there was no mistaking; never forgetting meanwhile to
stop and offer a helping hand over every bit of rough road, puddle, or
bog.He gave us a vivid picture of winter life at the Lizard: when the
little community has to hybernate, like the squirrels and field-mice,
upon its summer savings."Sometimes we don't earn a halfpenny for weeks and months, and then if
we've got nothing to fall back upon it's a bad job, you see, ma'am."I asked him if much money went for drink; they seemed to me a
remarkably sober set at the Lizard."Yes, I think we are; we're obliged to be; we can't spend money at the
public-house, for we've got none to spend.I'm no teetotaller myself,"
added John boldly."I don't dislike a glass of beer now and then, if I
can afford it, and when I can't afford it I can do without it, and if I
do take it I always know when to stop."Ay, that is the crucial test--the knowing when to stop.It is this
which makes all the difference between a good man and a villain, a wise
man and a fool.Self-control--a quality which, guided by conscience and
common sense, is the best possession of any human being.And looking at
the honest fisherman, one felt pretty sure he had his share of it."Now I must leave you, ladies," said he, a great deal sooner than we
wished, for we much liked talking to him."My time's nearly up, and I
mustn't keep my gentleman waiting; he goes out in my boat every day,
and has been a good friend to me.The road's straight before you,
ladies; and there's another party just ahead of you.Follow the track,
and you'll soon be at Kynance.It's a lovely day for the Cove, and I
hope you'll enjoy yourselves."John bared his grey head, with a salutation worthy of some old knight
of the Round Table, and then strode back, in double-quick time, as
active and upright as any young fellow of twenty-five, across the level
down.When, afterwards, I stood one dull winter day
in a London Art Gallery, opposite the _Cornish Lions_, how well I
recalled this day!How truly Brett's picture gives the long roll of
the wave upon the silver sands, the richly-tinted rocks and caves, the
brightness and freshness of everything.And those merry girls beside
me, who had the faculty of enjoying all they had, and all they did,
without regretting what they had not or what they might not do--with
heroic resignation they promised not to attempt to swim in the tempting
smooth water beyond the long rollers.Though knocked down again and
again, they always emerged from the waves with shouts of laughter.Mere
dots they looked to my anxious eyes--a couple of corks tossed hither
and thither on the foaming billows--and very thankful I was to get them
safe back into the "drawing-room," the loveliest of lovely caves.There was no time to lose; by noon our parlour floor--what a fairy
floor it was!of the softest, most delicious sand--would be all covered
with waves.And before then there was a deal to be seen and done, the
Bellows, the Gull Rock, Asparagus Island--even if we left out the
dangerous points with the ugly names that Curgenven had warned us
against.What is there in humanity, certainly in youthful humanity, that if
it can attain its end in two ways, one quiet and decorous, the other
difficult and dangerous, is certain to choose the latter?"We must manage to get you to the Bellows, it is such a curious sight,"
said my girls as they returned from it."Don't be frightened--come
along!"By dint of pulling, pushing, and the help of stick and arm, I came:
stood watching the spout of water which, in certain conditions of the
tide, forces itself through a tiny fissure in the rock with a great
roar, and joined in the childish delight of waiting, minute by minute,
for the biggest spout, the loudest roar.But Asparagus Island (where was no asparagus at all) I totally
declined.Not being a goat or a chamois, I contented myself with
sitting where I could gain the best view of the almost invisible
path by which my adventurous young "kids" disappeared.Happily they
had both steady heads and cool nerves; they were neither rash nor
unconscientious.I knew they would come back as soon as they could.So
I waited patiently, contemplating a fellow-victim who seemed worse off
than myself; a benign-looking clergyman, who kept walking up and down
the soppy sands, and shouting at intervals to two young people, a man
and a woman, who appeared to be crawling like flies along the face of
the rock towards another rock, with a yawning cave and a wide fissure
between.the clergyman cried at the top of his voice."Your young people seem rather venturesome," said I sympathetically.[Illustration: THE STEEPLE ROCK, KYNANCE COVE.]"Not _my_ young people," was the dignified answer."My girls are up
there, on Asparagus Rock, which is easy enough climbing.They promised
not to go farther, and they never disobey their mother and me.I declare he is taking her to the most dangerous part, that
rock where you have to jump--a good jump it is, and if you miss your
footing you are done for, you go right into the boiling waves below.Well, it's no business of mine; she is his own property; he is engaged
to her, but"--

I fear I made some very severe remarks on the folly of a young man who
could thus risk life and limbs--not only his own, but those of his wife
to be; and on the weakness of a girl who could allow herself to be
tempted, even by a lover, into such selfish foolhardiness."They must manage their own affairs," said the old gentleman
sententiously, perhaps not being so much given to preaching (out of the
pulpit) as I was.And very sensible girls they looked, clad in a practical, convenient
fashion, just fitted for scrambling.By them I sent a message to my own
girls, explaining the best descent from Asparagus Island, and repeating
the warning against attempting Hell's Mouth."Yes, you are quite right," said my elderly friend, as we sat down
together on the least uncomfortable stone we could find, and watched
the juniors disappear over the rocks."I like to see girls active and
brave; I never hinder them in any reasonable enjoyment, even though
there may be risk in it--one must run some risk--and a woman may
have to save life as well as a man.But foolhardy bravado I not only
dislike--I _despise_ it."In which sentiments I so entirely agreed that we fraternised there
and then; began talking on all sorts of subjects--some of them the
very serious and earnest subjects that one occasionally drops into by
mere chance, with mere strangers.I recall that half hour on Kynance
Sands as one of the pleasant memories of our tour, though to this day
I have not the remotest idea who my companion was.Except that as soon
as he spoke I recognised the reader whose voice had so struck me in
last night's thanksgiving service; reminding me of Frederick Denison
Maurice, whom this generation is almost beginning to forget, but whom
we elders never can forget.The tide was creeping on now--nay, striding, wave after wave, through
"parlour" and "drawing-room," making ingress and egress alike
impossible.In fact, a newly arrived party of tourists, who had stood
unwisely long contemplating the Bellows, were seen to gaze in despair
from their rock which had suddenly become an island.No chance for them
except to wade--and in a few minutes more they would probably have
to swim ashore.What became of them we did not stay to see, for an
anxious, prudent little voice, always thoughtful for "mother," insisted
on our precipitate flight before the advancing tide.Kynance, lovely as
it is, has its inconveniences.Departing, we met a whole string of tourist-looking people, whom we
benevolently warned that they were too late, at which they did not
seem in the least disappointed.Probably they were one of the numerous
pic-nic parties who come here from Falmouth or Helstone, to spend a
jovial day of eating and drinking, and enjoy the delights of the flesh
rather than the spirit.At any rate the romance and solitude of the place were gone.The quaint
old woman at the serpentine shop--a mild little wooden erection under
the cliff--was being chaffed and bargained with by three youths with
cigars, which defiled the whole air around, and made us take refuge up
the hill.But even there a white umbrella had sprung up like a gigantic
mushroom, and under it sat an energetic lady artist, who, entering at
once into conversation, with a cheerful avidity that implied her not
having talked for a week, informed us of all she was painting, and all
she had meant to paint, where she lodged, and how much she paid for her
lodging--evidently expecting the same confidences from us in return.But we were getting hungry, and between us and dinner was a long
two-miles walk over the steep downs, that were glowing, nay, burning,
under the September sun.So we turned homeward, glad of more than one
rest by the way, and a long pause beside a pretty little stream; where
we were able to offer the immemorial cup of cold water to several
thirsty souls besides ourselves.Some of us by this time were getting
to feel not so young as we had fancied ourselves in the early morning,
and to wish regretfully for Charles and his carriage.However, we got home at last--to find that sad accompaniment of many a
holiday--tidings of sickness and death.Nothing very near us--nothing
that need hurry us home--but enough to sadden us, and make our evening
walk, which we bravely carried out, a far less bright one than that of
the forenoon.The girls had found a way, chiefly on the tops of "hedges," to the
grand rock called Lizard Point.Thither we went, and watched the
sunset--a very fine one; then came back through the village, and made
various purchases of serpentine from John Curgenven's wife, who was
a great deal younger than himself, but not near so handsome or so
original.But a cloud had come over us; it did not, and must not stay--still,
there it was for the time.When the last thing at night I went out into
the glorious moonlight--bright as day--and thought of the soul who had
just passed out of a long and troubled life into the clearness of life
eternal, it seemed as if all was right still.Small cares and worries
dwindled down or melted away--as the petty uglinesses around melted
in the radiance of this glorious harvest moon, which seemed to wrap
one round in a silent peace, like the "garment of praise," which David
speaks about--in exchange for "the spirit of heaviness."DAY THE EIGHTH


And seven days were all we could allow ourselves at the Lizard, if we
meant to see the rest of Cornwall.We began to reckon with sore hearts
that five days were already gone, and it seemed as if we had not seen
half we ought to see, even of our near surroundings."We will take no excursion to-day.We will just have our bath at Housel
Cove and then we will wander about the shore, and examine the Lizard
Lights.Only fancy, our going away to-morrow without having seen the
inside of the Lizard Lights!Oh, I wish we were not leaving so soon.We
shall never like any place as we like the Lizard."Directly after breakfast--and we are
people who never vary from our eight o'clock breakfast, so that we
always see the world in its early morning brightness and freshness--we
went

  "Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,"

along the fields, which led down to Housel or Househole Cove.Before
us, clear in the sunshine, rose the fine headland of Penolver, and
the green <DW72>s of the amphitheatre of Belidden, supposed to be the
remains of a Druidical temple.That, and the chair of Belidden, a
recess in the rock, whence there is a splendid view, with various
archaeological curiosities, true or traditionary, we ought to have
examined, I know.Some of us were content to
rejoice in the general atmosphere of beauty and peace without minute
investigation, and some of us were so eminently practical that "a good
bathe" appeared more important than all the poetry and archaeology in
the world.So we wandered slowly on, rejoicing at having the place all to
ourselves, when we came suddenly upon a tall black figure intently
watching three other black figures, or rather dots, which were climbing
slowly over Penolver.It was our clerical friend of Kynance; with whom, in the natural and
right civility of holiday-makers, we exchanged a courteous good morning.[Illustration: THE LION ROCKS--A SEA IN WHICH NOTHING CAN LIVE.]"Yes, those are my girls up on the cliff there.They have been bathing,
and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.""Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance?They all came
back to you with whole limbs?""Yes," said he smiling, "and they went again for another long walk
in the afternoon.At night, when it turned out to be such splendid
moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing.Of course
you know about launce-fishing?"I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport."Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard.My boys--and girls too--consider
it the best fun going.The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to
these coasts.It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand
just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can
trace the silvery gleam of the creature.So you stand up to your ankles
on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him
up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.""Easy fishing," said I, with a certain pity for the sand-eel.You are apt either to chop him right in
two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and
disappears.My young people say it requires a practised hand and a
peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce
fishing.It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and
a day or two after--and they are out half the night.They go about
barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings.About
midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have
caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night.They came home
as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning.Perhaps you might
not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?"I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for
hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish.However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to
some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of
pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard.I am not aware
that it is practised at any other part of the Cornish coast, nor can
I say whether or not it was a pastime of King Arthur and his Knights.One cannot imagine Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot occupied in spearing a
small sand-eel.The bathing at Housel Cove was delightful as ever.And afterwards we
saw that very rare and beautiful sight, a perfect solar rainbow.Not
the familiar bow of Noah, but a great luminous circle round the sun,
like the halo often seen round the moon, extending over half the sky;
yellow at first, then gradually assuming faint prismatic tints.This
colouring, though never so bright as the ordinary arched rainbow, was
wonderfully tender and delicate.We stood a long time watching it,
till at last it melted slowly out of the sky, leaving behind a sense of
mystery, as of something we had never seen before and might never see
again in all our lives.It was a lovely day, bright and warm as midsummer, tempting us to some
distant excursion; but we had decided to investigate the Lizard Lights.We should have been content to take them for granted, in their purely
poetical phase, as we had watched them night after night.But some of
us were blessed with scientific relatives, who would have despised us
utterly if we had spent a whole week at the Lizard and never gone to
see the Lizard Lights.So we felt bound to do our duty, and admire, if
we could not understand.I chronicle with shame that the careful and
courteous explanations of that most intelligent young man, who met us
at the door of the huge white building, apparently quite glad to have
an opportunity of conducting us through it, were entirely thrown away.We mounted ladders, we looked at Brobdingnagian lamps, we poked into
mysterious machinery for lighting them and for sounding the fog-horn,
we listened to all that was told us, and tried to look as if we took it
in.Very much interested we could not but be at such wonderful results
of man's invention, but as for comprehending!we came away with our
minds as dark as when we went in.I have always found through life that, next to being clever, the safest
thing is to know one's own ignorance and acknowledge it.Therefore let
me leave all description of the astonishing mechanism of the Lizard
Lights--I believe the first experiment of their kind, and not very
long established--to abler pens and more intelligent brains.To see
that young man, scarcely above the grade of a working man, handling
his instruments and explaining them and their uses, seeming to take
for granted that we could understand--which alas!we didn't, not
an atom!--inspired me with a sense of humiliation and awe.Also of
pride at the wonders this generation has accomplished, and is still
accomplishing; employing the gradually comprehended forces of Nature
against herself, as it were, and dominating her evil by ever-new
discoveries and applications of the recondite powers of good.The enormous body of light produced nightly--equal, I think he said,
to 30,000 candles--and the complicated machinery for keeping the
fog-horn continually at work, when even that gigantic blaze became
invisible--all this amount of skill, science, labour, and money,
freely expended for the saving of life, gave one a strong impression of
not only British power but British beneficence.Could King Arthur have
come back again from his sea-engulfed Land of Lyonesse, and stood where
we stood, beside the Lizard Lights, what would he have said to it all?[Illustration: HAULING IN THE BOATS.]Even though we did not understand, we were keenly interested in all we
saw, and still more so in the stories of wrecks which this young man
had witnessed even during the few years, or months--I forget which--of
his stay at the Lizard.He, too, agreed, that the rocks there, called
by the generic name of the Stags, were the most fatal of all on our
coasts to ships outward and homeward bound.Probably because in the
latter case, captain and crews get a trifle careless; and in the
former--as I have heard in sad explanation of many emigrant ships being
lost almost immediately after quitting port--they get drunk.Many of
the sailors are said to come on board "half-seas over," and could the
skilfullest of pilots save a ship with a drunken crew?Be that as it may, the fact remains, that throughout winter almost
every week's chronicle at the Lizard is the same story--wild storms, or
dense fogs, guns of distress heard, a hasty manning of the life-boat,
dragged with difficulty down the steep cliff-road, a brief struggle
with the awful sea, and then, even if a few lives are saved, with the
ship herself all is over."Only last Christmas I saw a vessel go to pieces in ten minutes on the
rocks below there," said the man, after particularising several wrecks,
which seemed to have imprinted themselves on his memory with all their
incidents."Yes, we have a bad time in winter, and the coastguard
men lead a risky life.They are the picked men of the service, and
tolerably well paid, but no money could ever pay them for what they go
through--or the fishermen, who generally are volunteers, and get little
or nothing.""It must be a hard life in these parts, especially in winter," we
observed."Well, perhaps it is, but it's our business, you see."Yes, but not all people do their business, as the mismanagements and
mistakes of this world plainly show.Still, it is a good world, and we felt it so as we strolled along the
sunshiny cliff, talking over all these stories, tragical or heroic,
which had been told us in such a simple matter-of-fact way, as if they
were every-day occurrences.And then, while the young folks went on
"for a good scramble" over Penolver, I sat down for a quiet "think";
that enforced rest, which, as years advance, becomes not painful, but
actually pleasant; in which, if one fails to solve the problems of the
universe, one is prone to con them over, wondering at them all.From the sunny sea and sunny sky, full of a silence so complete that I
could hear every wave as it broke on the unseen rocks below, my mind
wandered to that young fellow among his machinery, with his sickly
eager face and his short cough--indicating that _his_ "business" in
this world, over which he seemed so engrossed, might only too soon
come to an end.Between these apparently eternal powers of Nature,
so strong, so fierce, so irresistible, against which man fought so
magnificently with all his perfection of scientific knowledge and
accuracy of handiwork--and this poor frail human life, which in a
moment might be blown out like a candle, suddenly quenched in darkness,
"there is no skill or knowledge in the grave whither thou goest"--what
a contrast it was!And yet--and yet?--We shall sleep with our fathers, and some of us feel
sometimes so tired that we do not in the least mind going to sleep.But
notwithstanding this, notwithstanding everything without that seems to
imply our perishableness, we are conscious of something within which
is absolutely imperishable.We feel it only stronger and clearer as
life begins to melt away from us; as "the lights in the windows are
darkened, and the daughters of music are brought low."To the young,
death is often a terror, for it seems to put an end to the full, rich,
passionate life beyond which they can see nothing; but to the old,
conscious that this their tabernacle is being slowly dissolved, and yet
its mysterious inhabitant, the wonderful, incomprehensible _me_, is
exactly the same--thinks, loves, suffers, and enjoys, precisely as it
did heaven knows how many years ago--to them, death appears in quite
another shape.He is no longer Death the Enemy, but Death the Friend,
who may--who can tell?--give back all that life has denied or taken
away.He cannot harm us, and he may bless us, with the blessing of
loving children, who believe that, whatever happens, nothing can take
them out of their Father's arms.But I had not come to Cornwall to preach, except to myself now and
then, as this day.My silent sermon was all done by the time the
young folks came back, full of the beauties of their cliff walk, and
their affectionate regrets that I "could never manage it," but must
have felt so dull, sitting on a stone and watching the sheep and the
sea-gulls.I was obliged to confess that I never am "dull,"
as people call it, and love solitude almost as much as society.[Illustration: ENYS DODNAN AND PARDENICK POINTS.]So, each contented in our own way, we went merrily home, to find
waiting for us our cosy tea--the last!--and our faithful Charles, who,
according to agreement, appeared overnight, to take charge of us till
we got back to civilisation and railways."Yes, ladies, here I am," said he with a beaming countenance."And
I've got you the same carriage and the same horse, as you wished, and
I've come in time to give him a good night's rest.Now, when shall you
start, and what do you want to do to-morrow?"Our idea had been to take for our next resting-place Marazion.This
queer-named town had attracted us ever since the days when we learnt
geography.Since, we had heard a good deal about it: how it had
been inhabited by Jewish colonists, who bought tin from the early
Ph[oe]nician workers of the Cornish mines, and been called by them
Mara-Zion--bitter Zion--corrupted by the common people into Market-Jew.Michael's Mount opposite; and attracted
us much more than genteel Penzance.So did a letter we got from the
landlord of its one hotel, promising to take us in, and make us
thoroughly comfortable.Charles declared we could, and even see
a good deal on the road.Mary will be delighted to get another
peep at you ladies, and while I rest the horse you can go in and look
at the old church--it's very curious, they say.And then we'll go on
to Gunwalloe,--there's another church there, close by the sea, built
by somebody who was shipwrecked.But then it's so old and so small.However, we can stop and look at it if you like."His good common sense, and kindliness, when he might so easily have
done his mere duty and taken us the shortest and ugliest route, showing
us nothing, decided us to leave all in Charles's hands, and start at
10 A.M.for Penzance, _via_ Helstone, where we all wished to
stay an hour or two, and find out a "friend," the only one we had in
Cornwall.So all was settled, with but a single regret, that several boating
excursions we had planned with John Curgenven had all fallen through,
and we should never behold some wonderful sea-caves between the Lizard
and Cadgwith, which we had set our hearts upon visiting.Charles fingered his cap with a thoughtful air."I don't see why you
shouldn't, ladies.If I was to go direct and tell John Curgenven to
have a boat ready at Church Cove, and we was to start at nine instead
of ten, and drive there, the carriage might wait while you rowed to
the caves and back; we should still reach Helstone by dinner-time, and
Marazion before dark."And at this addition to his
work Charles looked actually pleased!So--all was soon over, our easy packing done, our bill paid--a very
small one--our goodnights said to the kindly handmaid, Esther, who
hoped we would come back again some time, and promised to keep the
artistic mural decorations of our little parlour in memory of us.My
young folks went to bed, and then, a little before midnight, when all
the house was quiet, I put a shawl over my head, unlatched the innocent
door--no bolts or bars at the Lizard--and went out into the night.What a night it was!--mild as summer, clear as day: the full moon
sailing aloft in an absolutely cloudless sky.Not a breath, not a
sound--except the faint thud-thud of the in-coming waves, two miles
off, at Kynance, the outline of which, and of the whole coast, was
distinctly visible.A silent earth, lying under a silent heaven.Looking up, one felt almost like a disembodied soul, free to cleave
through infinite space and gain--what?Is it human or divine, this ceaseless longing after something never
attained, this craving after the eternal life, which, if fully believed
in, fully understood, would take all the bitterness out of this life?But so much is given, and all given is so infinitely good, except where
we ourselves turn it into evil, that surely more, and better, will be
given to us by and by.Those only truly enjoy life who fear not death:
who can say of the grave as if it were their bed: "I will lay me down
in peace and take my rest, for it is Thou only, O God, who makest me to
dwell in safety."DAY THE NINTH


And our last at the Lizard, which a week ago had been to us a mere word
or dot in a map; now we carried away from it a living human interest in
everything and everybody.Esther bade us a cordial farewell: Mrs.Curgenven, standing at the
door of her serpentine shop, repeated the good wishes, and informed
us that John and his boat had already started for Church Cove.As we
drove through the bright little Lizard Town, and past the Church of
Landewednack, wondering if we should ever see either again, we felt
quite sad.Leaving the carriage and Charles at the nearest point to the Cove, we
went down the steep descent, and saw John rocking in his boat, and
beckoning to us with a bland and smiling countenance.But between us
and him lay a sort of causeway, of the very roughest rocks, slippery
with sea-weed, and beat upon by waves--such waves!Yet clearly, if we
meant to get into the boat at all, we must seize our opportunity and
jump in between the flux and reflux of that advancing tide.I am not a coward: I love boats, and was well used to them in my youth,
but now--my heart misgave me.There were but two alternatives--to
stop the pleasure of the whole party, and leave Cornwall with these
wonderful sea-caves unseen, or to let my children go alone.Neither was
possible; so I hailed a sturdy youth at work hard by, and asked him if
he would take charge of an old lady across the rocks.He grinned from
ear to ear, but came forward, and did his duty manfully and kindly.My
young folks, light as feathers, bounded after; and with the help of
John Curgenven, chivalrous and careful as ever, we soon found ourselves
safely in the boat.[Illustration: JOHN CURGENVEN FISHING.]"Here we go up, up, up, and here we go down,
down, down," was the principle of our voyage, the most serious one we
ever took in an open boat with a single pair of oars.Never did I see
such waves,--at least, never did I float upon them, in a boat that went
tossing like a bit of cork out into the open sea.John seemed not to mind them in the least.His strong arms swept the
boat along, and he still found breath to talk to us, pointing out the
great gloomy cliffs we were passing under, and telling us stories of
wrecks, the favourite theme--and no wonder.This sunshiny morning that iron-bound coast looked awful enough; what
must it have looked like, on the winter night when the emigrant ship
_Brest_ went down!"Yes, it was about ten o'clock at night," said John."I was fast asleep
in bed, but they knocked me up; I got on my clothes and was off in
five minutes.They are always glad enough to get us fishermen, the
coastguard are.Mine was the first boat-load we brought ashore; we
would only take women and children that time.They were all in their
night-gowns, and they couldn't speak a word of English, but we made
them understand somehow.One woman threw her three children down to me,
and stayed behind on the wreck with two more.""Oh, no, they were very quiet, dazed like.Some of them seemed to be
saying their prayers.But they made no fuss at all, not even the little
ones.They lay down in the bottom of the boat, and we rowed ashore
as fast as we could, to Cadgwith.Then we rowed back and fetched two
boatloads more.We saved a lot of lives that wreck, but only their
lives; they had scarcely a rag of clothes on, and some of the babies
were as naked as when they were born.""Everybody: we always do it," answered John, as if surprised at
the question."The fishermen's cottages were full, and so was the
parsonage.We gave them clothes, and kept them till they could be sent
away.Yes, it was an awful night; I got something to remember it by,
here."He held out his hand, from which we noticed half of one finger was
missing."It got squeezed off with a rope somehow.I didn't heed it much at
the time," said John carelessly."But look, we're at the first of the
caves.I'll row in close, ladies, and let you see it."So we had to turn our minds from the vision of the wreck of the
_Brest_, which John's simple words made so terribly vivid, to examine
Raven's Ugo, and Dolor Ugo; _ugo_ is Cornish for cave.Over the
entrance of the first a pair of ravens have built from time immemorial.It is just accessible, the opening being above the sea-line, and hung
with quantities of sea-ferns.Here in smuggling days, many kegs of
spirits used to be secreted: and many a wild drama no doubt has been
acted there--daring encounters between smugglers and coastguard men,
not bloodless on either side.Dolor Ugo is now inaccessible and unusable.Its only floor is of
heaving water, a deep olive green, and so clear that we could see the
fishes swimming about pursuing a shoal of launce.Its high-vaulted roof
and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and
purple.The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually
narrowed into impenetrable darkness.How far inland it goes no one can
tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous
experiment.Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a
favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which
reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave.A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and
out again, into the sunshiny open sea.Which we had now got used to;
and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting
to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face.We felt sad to
think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard
coast.But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to
row.Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery
sea-weedy rocks.In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this
feat, and then--

Well, it is over, and I sit here writing these details.But I would
not do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and
having a row with John Curgenven.he looked relieved when he saw "the old lady" safe on
_terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he "rocked in his
boat in the bay."May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to
him!May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few!I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do
theirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he "will know the reason
why."Charles was ready; waiting patiently in front of a blacksmith's shop.fate had overtaken us in the shape of an innocent leak in
John Curgenven's boat; nothing, doubtless, to him, who was in the habit
of baling it out with his boots, and then calmly putting them on again,
but a little inconvenient to us.To drive thirty miles with one's
garments soaked up to the knees was not desirable.There was a cottage close by, whence came the gleam of a delicious fire
and the odour of ironing clothes.We went in: the mistress, evidently
a laundress, advanced and offered to dry us--which she did, chattering
all the while in the confidential manner of country folks.A hard working, decent body she was, and as for her house, it was a
perfect picture of cleanliness and tidiness.Its two rooms, kitchen and
bedroom, were absolutely speckless.When we noticed this, and said we
found the same in many Cornish cottages; she almost seemed offended at
the praise."Oh, that's nothing, ma'am.We hereabouts all likes to have our places
tidy.Mine's not over tidy to-day because of the washing.But if you was to come of a Sunday.Her eye
caught something in a dark corner, at which she flew, apron in hand."I
declare, I'm quite ashamed.I didn't think we had one in the house."Dried, warmed, and refreshed, but having found the greatest difficulty
in inducing the good woman to receive any tangible thanks for her
kindness, we proceeded on our journey; going over the same ground which
we had traversed already, and finding Pradenack Down as bleak and
beautiful as ever.Our first halt was at the door of Mary Mundy, who,
with her unappreciated brother, ran out to meet us, and looked much
disappointed when she found we had not come to stay."But you will come some time, ladies, and I'll make you so comfortable.And you'll give my duty to the professor"--it was vain to explain that
four hundred miles lay between our home and his.He was a very nice gentleman, please'm.I shall be delighted to
see him again, please'm," &c., &c.

We left the three--Mary, her brother, and Charles--chattering together
in a dialect which I do not attempt to reproduce, and sometimes could
hardly understand.Us, the natives indulged with their best English,
but among themselves they talked the broadest Cornish.It was a very old church, and a preternaturally old beadle showed it in
a passive manner, not recognising in the least its points of interest
and beauty, except some rows of open benches with ancient oak backs,
wonderfully carved."Our vicar dug them up from under the flooring and turned them into
pews.There was a gentleman here the other day who said there was
nothing like them in all England."Most curious, in truth, they were, and suited well the fine old
building--a specimen of how carefully and lavishly our forefathers
built "for God."We, who build for ourselves, are rather surprised
to find in out-of-the-way nooks like this, churches that in size and
adornment must have cost years upon years of loving labour as well as
money.It was pleasant to know that the present incumbent, a man of
archaeological tastes, appreciated his blessings, and took the utmost
care of his beautiful old church.even though he cannot
boast the power of his predecessor, the Reverend Thomas Flavel, who
died in 1682, and whose monument in the chancel really expresses the
sentiments--in epitaph--of the period:

  "Earth, take thine earth; my sin, let Satan have it;
  The world my goods; my soul my God who gave it.For from these four, Earth, Satan, World, and God,
  My flesh, my sin, my goods, my soul, I had."But it does not mention that the reverend gentleman was the best
_ghost-layer_ in all England, and that when he died his ghost also
required to be laid, by a brother clergyman, in a spot on the down
still pointed out by the people of Mullion, who, being noted for
extreme longevity, have passed down this tradition from generation
to generation, with an earnest credulity that we of more enlightened
counties can hardly understand.From Mullion we went on to Gunwalloe.Its church, "small and old," as
Charles had depreciatingly said, had been so painfully "restored,"
and looked so bran-new and uninteresting that we contented ourselves
with a distant look.It was close to the sea--probably built on the
very spot where its pious founder had been cast ashore.The one curious
point about it was the detached belfry, some yards distant from the
church itself.It sat alone in a little cove, down which a sluggish
river crawled quietly seaward.A sweet quiet place, but haunted, as
usual, by tales of cruel shipwrecks--of sailors huddled for hours on
a bit of rock just above the waves, till a boat could put out and
save the few survivors; of sea treasures continually washed ashore
from lost ships--Indian corn, coffee, timber, dollars--many are still
found in the sand after a storm.And one treasure more, of which the
recollection is still kept at Gunwalloe, "a little dead baby in its cap
and night-gown, with a necklace of coral beads."Our good horse, with the dogged
persistency of Cornish horses and Cornish men, plodded on mile after
mile.Sometimes for an hour or more we did not meet a living soul;
then we came upon a stray labourer, or passed through a village where
healthy-looking children, big-eyed, brown-faced, and dirty-handed,
picturesque if not pretty, stared at us from cottage doors, or from the
gates of cottage gardens full of flowers and apples.Hungry and thirsty, we could not
resist them.After passing several trees, hung thickly with delicious
fruit, we attacked the owner of one of them, a comely young woman, with
a baby in her arms and another at her gown."Oh yes, ma'am, you may have as many apples as you like, if your young
ladies will go and get them."And while they did it, she stood talking by the carriage door, pouring
out to me her whole domestic history with a simple frankness worthy of
the golden age."No, really I couldn't," putting back my payment--little enough-- for
the splendid basket of apples which the girls brought back in triumph."This is such a good apple year; the pigs would get them if the young
ladies didn't.You're kindly welcome to them--well then, if you are
determined, say sixpence."On which magnificent "sixpenn'orth," we lived for days!Indeed I think
we brought some of it home as a specimen of Cornish fruit and Cornish
liberality.[Illustration: THE ARMED KNIGHT AND THE LONG SHIP'S LIGHTHOUSE.]Helstone was reached at last, and we were not sorry for rest and food
in the old-fashioned inn, whence we could look out of window, and
contemplate the humours of the little town, which doubtless considered
itself a very great one.It was market day, and the narrow street was
thronged with beasts and men--the latter as sober as the former,
which spoke well for Cornwall.Sober and civil too was every one we
addressed in asking our way to the house of our unknown friend, whose
only address we had was Helstone.But he seemed well known in the town,
though neither a rich man, nor a great man, nor--No, I cannot say he
was not a clever man, for in his own line, mechanical engineering, he
must have been exceedingly clever.And he was what people call "a great
character;" would have made such an admirable study for a novelist,
manipulated into an unrecognisable ideal--the only way in which it is
fair to put people in books.When I saw him I almost regretted that I
write novels no more.We passed through the little garden--all ablaze with autumn colour,
every inch utilised for either flowers, vegetables, or fruit--went into
the parlour, sent our cards and waited the result.In two minutes our friend appeared, and gave us such a welcome!But to
explain it I must trench a little upon the sanctities of private life,
and tell the story of this honest Cornishman.When still young he went to Brazil, and was employed by an English
gold-mining company there, for some years.Afterwards he joined
an engineering firm, and superintended dredging, the erection of
saw-mills, &c., finally building a lighthouse, of which latter work he
had the sole charge, and was exceedingly proud.His conscientiousness,
probity, and entire reliableness made him most valuable to the
firm; whom he served faithfully for many years.When they, as well
as himself, returned to England, he still kept up a correspondence
with them, preserving towards every member of the family the most
enthusiastic regard and devotion.He rushed into the parlour, a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man, with a
shrewd, kindly face, which beamed all over with delight, as he began
shaking hands indiscriminately, saying how kind it was of us to come,
and how welcome we were.It was explained which of us he had specially to welcome, the others
being only humble appendages, friends of the family, this well-beloved
family, whose likenesses for two generations we saw everywhere about
the room."Yes, miss, there they all are, your dear grandfather" (alas, only a
likeness now!They were all so good to
me, and I would do anything for them, or for any one of their name.If
I got a message that they wanted me for anything, I'd be off to London,
or to Brazil, or anywhere, in half-an-hour."added the good man when the rapture and
excitement of the moment had a little subsided, and his various
questions as to the well-being of "the family" had been asked and
answered."You have dined, you say, but you'll have a cup of tea.My
wife (that's the little maid I used to talk to your father about, miss;
I always told him I wouldn't stay in Brazil, I must go back to England
and marry my little maid), my wife makes the best cup of tea in all
Cornwall.And there entered, in afternoon gown and cap, probably just put on, a
middle-aged, but still comely matron, who insisted that, even at this
early hour--3 P.M.--to get a cup of tea for us was "no trouble
at all.""Indeed, she wouldn't think anything a trouble, no more than I should,
miss, if it was for your family.It was here suggested that they were not a "forgetting" family.Nor
was he a man likely to be soon forgotten.While the cup of tea, which
proved to be a most sumptuous meal, was preparing, he took us all over
his house, which was full of foreign curiosities, and experimental
inventions.One, I remember, being a musical instrument, a sort of
organ, which he had begun making when a mere boy, and taken with him
all the way to Brazil and back.It had now found refuge in the little
room he called his "workshop," which was filled with odds and ends that
would have been delightful to a mechanical mind.He expounded them with
enthusiasm, and we tried not to betray an ignorance, which in some of
us would have been a sort of hereditary degradation.they were clever--your father and your uncle!--and how proud we
all were when we finished our lighthouse, and got the Emperor to light
it up for the first time.Look here, ladies, what do you think this is?"He took out a small parcel, and solemnly unwrapped from it fold after
fold of paper, till he came to the heart of it--a small wax candle!"This was the candle the Emperor used to light our lighthouse.I've
kept it for nearly thirty years, and I'll keep it as long as I live.Every year on the anniversary of the day I light it, drink his
Majesty's health, and the health of all your family, miss, and then I
put it out again.So"--carefully re-wrapping the relic in its numerous
envelopes--"so I hope it will last my time."Here the mistress came behind her good man, and they exchanged a
smile--the affectionate smile of two who had never been more than two,
Darby and Joan, but all sufficient to each other.How we got through it I hardly know,
but travelling is hungry work, and the viands were delicious.The
beneficence of our kind hosts, however, was not nearly done."Come, ladies, I'll show you my garden, and--(give me a basket and the
grape-scissors,)" added he in a conjugal aside.Which resulted in our
carrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well
as a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and
bag."Nonsense, nonsense," was the answer to vain remonstrances."D'ye
think I wouldn't give the best of everything I had to your family?How your father used to laugh at me about my
little maid!Oh yes, I'm glad I came
home.And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some
day they'll come to see me down here--wouldn't it be a proud day for
me!It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal
fidelity.It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally
inclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its
exposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to "bold Sir
Bedevere," and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall.With a sense of real regret, feeling that it would be long ere we
might meet his like--such shrewd simplicity, earnest enthusiasm, and
exceeding faithfulness--we bade good-bye to the honest man; leaving him
and his wife standing at their garden-gate, an elderly Adam and Eve,
desiring nothing outside their own little paradise.Which of us could
say more, or as much?Gratefully we "talked them over," as we drove on through the pretty
country round Helstone--inland country; for we had no time to go and
see the Loe Pool, a small lake, divided from the sea by a bar of sand.This is supposed to be the work of the Cornwall man-demon, Tregeagle;
and periodically cut through, with solemn ceremonial, by the Mayor of
Helstone, when the "meeting of the waters," fresh and salt, is said to
be an extremely curious sight.But we did not see it, nor yet Nonsloe
House, close by, which is held by the tenure of having to provide a
boat and nets whenever the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Cornwall
wishes to fish in the Loe Pool.A circumstance which has never happened
yet, certainly!Other curiosities _en route_ we also missed, the stones of
Tremenkeverne, half a ton each, used as missiles in a notable fight
between two saints, St.Just of the Land's End, and St.Keverne of the
Lizard, and still lying in a field to prove the verity of the legend.Also the rock of Goldsithney, where, when the "fair land of Lyonesse"
was engulfed by the sea, an ancestor of the Trevelyans saved himself by
swimming his horse, and landing; and various other remarkable places,
with legends attached, needing much credulity, or imagination, to
believe in.But, fearing to be benighted ere reaching Marazion, we passed them all,
and saw nothing more interesting than the ruins of disused tin mines,
which Charles showed us, mournfully explaining how the mining business
had of late years drifted away from Cornwall, and how hundreds of the
once thriving community had been compelled to emigrate or starve.As we
neared Marazion, these melancholy wrecks with their little hillocks of
mining debris rose up against the evening sky, the image of desolation.Michael's Mount, the picture in little of Mont St.Michel,
in Normandy, appeared in the middle of Mount's Bay.Lastly, after
a gorgeous sunset, in a golden twilight and silvery moonlight, we
entered Marazion;-and found it, despite its picturesque name, the most
commonplace little town imaginable!We should have regretted our rash decision, and gone on to Penzance,
but for the hearty welcome given us at a most comfortable and home-like
inn, which determined us to keep to our first intention, and stay.So, after our habit of making the best of things, we walked down to the
ugly beach, and investigated the dirty-looking bay--in the lowest of
all low tides, with a soppy, sea-weedy causeway running across to St.By advice of Charles, we made acquaintance with an old
boatman he knew, a Norwegian who had drifted hither--shipwrecked, I
believe--settled down and married an English woman, but whose English
was still of the feeblest kind.However, he had an honest face; so we
engaged him to take us out bathing early to-morrow."Wouldn't you
like to row round the Mount?--When you've had your tea, I'll come back
for you, and help you down to the shore--it's rather rough, but nothing
like what you have done, ma'am," added he encouragingly."And it will
be bright moonlight, and the Mount will look so fine."So, the spirit of adventure conquering our weariness, we went.When
I think how it looked next morning--the small, shallow bay, with its
toy-castle in the centre, I am glad our first vision of it was under
the glamour of moonlight, with the battlemented rock throwing dark
shadows across the shimmering sea.In the mysterious beauty of that
night row round the Mount, we could imagine anything; its earliest
inhabitant, the giant Cormoran, killed by that "valiant Cornishman,"
the illustrious Jack; the lovely St.Keyne, a king's daughter, who came
thither on pilgrimage; and, passing down from legend to history, Henry
de la Pomeroy, who, being taken prisoner, caused himself to be bled to
death in the Castle; Sir John Arundel, slain on the sands, and buried
in the Chapel; Perkin Warbeck's unfortunate wife, who took refuge at
St.And so on, and so on,
through the centuries, to the family of St.Aubyn, who bought it in
1660, and have inhabited it ever since."Very nice people," we heard
they were; who have received here the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and
other royal personages.Yet, looking up as we rowed under the gloomy rock, we could fancy his
giant ghost sitting there, on the spot where he killed his wife, for
bringing in her apron greenstone, instead of granite, to build the
chapel with.Which being really built of greenstone the story must be
true!What a pleasure it is to be able to believe anything!Some of us could have stayed out half the night, floating along in the
mild soft air and dreamy moonlight, which made even the commonplace
little town look like a fairy scene, and exalted St.Michael's Mount
into a grand fortress, fit for its centuries of legendary lore--but
others preferred going to bed.Not however without taking a long look out
of the window upon the bay, which now, at high tide, was one sheet of
rippling moon-lit water, with the grim old Mount, full of glimmering
lights like eyes, sitting silent in the midst of the silent sea.[Illustration: CORNISH FISHERMAN.]DAY THE TENTH


I cannot advise Marazion as a bathing place.What a down-come from the
picturesque vision of last night, to a small ugly fishy-smelling beach,
which seemed to form a part of the town and its business, and was
overlooked from everywhere!Yet on it two or three family groups were
evidently preparing for a dip, or rather a wade of about a quarter of a
mile in exceedingly dirty sea water."This will never do," we said to our old Norwegian."You must row us to
some quiet cove along the shore, and away from the town."He nodded his head, solemn and mute as the dumb boatman of dead Elaine,
rowed us out seaward for about half-a-mile, and then proceeded to
fasten the boat to a big stone, and walk ashore.The water still did
not come much above his knees--he seemed quite indifferent to it.Well, we could but do at Rome as the Romans do.Toilette in an open
boat was evidently the custom of the country.And the sun was warm, the
sea safe and shallow.Indeed, so rapidly did it subside, that by the
time the bath was done, we were aground, and had to call at the top of
our voices to our old man, who sat, with his back to us, dim in the
distance, on another big stone, calmly smoking the pipe of peace."We'll not try this again," was the unanimous resolve, as, after
politely declining a suggestion that "the ladies should walk ashore--"
did he think we were amphibious?--we got ourselves floated off at last,
and rowed to the nearest landing point, the entrance to St.Probably nowhere in England is found the like of this place.Such
a curious mingling of a mediaeval fortress and modern residence; of
antiquarian treasures and everyday business; for at the foot of the
rock is a fishing village of about thirty cottages, which carries
on a thriving trade; and here also is a sort of station for the tiny
underground-railway, which worked by a continuous chain, fulfils the
very necessary purpose (failing Giant Cormoran, and wife) of carrying
up coals, provisions, luggage, and all other domestic necessaries to
the hill top.Thither we climbed by a good many weary steps, and thought, delightful
as it may be to dwell on the top of a rock in the midst of the sea,
like eagles in an eyrie, there are certain advantages in living on a
level country road, or even in a town street.Aubyns manage when they go out to dinner?Two years afterwards,
when I read in the paper that one of the daughters of the house,
leaning over the battlements, had lost her balance and fallen down,
mercifully unhurt, to the rocky <DW72> below--the very spot where we
to-day sat so quietly gazing out on the lovely sea view--I felt with
a shudder that on the whole, it would be a trying thing to bring up a
young family on St.Still, generation after generation of honourable St.Aubyns have
brought up their families there, and oh!How fresh, and yet mild blew the soft sea-wind outside of it, and
inside, what endless treasures there were for the archaeological mind!The chapel alone was worth a morning's study, even though shown--odd
anachronism--by a footman in livery, who pointed out with great gusto
the entrance to a vault discovered during the last repairs, where was
found the skeleton of a large man--his bones only--no clue whatever as
to who he was or when imprisoned there.The "Jeames" of modern days
told us this tale with a noble indifference.Nothing of the kind was
likely to happen to him.Further still we were fortunate enough to penetrate, and saw the Chevy
Chase Hall, with its cornice of hunting scenes, the drawing-room, the
school-room--only fancy learning lessons there, amidst the veritable
evidence of the history one was studying!And perhaps the prettiest bit
of it all was our young guide, herself a St.Aubyn, with her simple
grace and sweet courtesy, worthy of one of the fair ladies worshipped
by King Arthur's knights.[Illustration: THE SEINE BOAT--A PERILOUS MOMENT.]We did not like encroaching on her kindness, though we could have
stayed all day, admiring the curious things she showed us.So we
descended the rock, and crossed the causeway, now dry, but very rough
walking--certainly St.Michael's Mount has its difficulties as a modern
dwelling-house--and went back to our inn.For, having given our
horse a forenoon's rest, we planned a visit to that spot immortalised
by nursery rhyme--

  "As I was going to St.Ives
  I met a man with seven wives.Each wife had seven sacks;
  Each sack had seven cats;
  Each cat had seven kits;
  Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,--
  How many were there going to St.--One; and after we had been there, we felt sure he never went again!There were two roads, we learnt, to that immortal town; one very good,
but dull; the other bad--and beautiful.We chose the latter, and never
repented.Nor, in passing through Penzance, did we repent not having taken up our
quarters there.It was pretty, but so terribly "genteel," so extremely
civilised.Glancing up at the grand hotel, we thought with pleasure of
our old-fashioned inn at Marazion, where the benign waiter took quite
a fatherly interest in our proceedings, even to giving us for dinner
our very own blackberries, gathered yesterday on the road, and politely
hindering another guest from helping himself to half a dishful, as
"they belonged to the young ladies."Truly, there are better things in
life than fashionable hotels.But the neighbourhood of Penzance is lovely.Shrubs and flowers such
as one sees on the shores of the Mediterranean grew and flourished in
cottage-gardens, and the forest trees we drove under, whole avenues
of them, were very fine; gentlemen's seats appeared here and there,
surrounded with the richest vegetation, and commanding lovely views.As
the road gradually mounted upwards, we saw, clear as in a panorama, the
whole coast from the Lizard Point to the Land's End,--which we should
behold to-morrow.For, hearing that every week-day about a hundred tourists in carriages,
carts, and omnibuses, usually flocked thither, we decided that the
desire of our lives, the goal of our pilgrimage, should be visited
by us on a Sunday.We thought that to drive us thither in solitary
Sabbatic peace would be fully as good for Charles's mind and morals as
to hang all day idle about Marazion; and he seemed to think so himself.Therefore, in prospect of to-morrow, he dealt very tenderly with his
horse to-day, and turned us out to walk up the heaviest hills, of which
there were several, between Penzance and Castle-an-Dinas."There it is," he said at last, stopping in the midst of a wide moor
and pointing to a small building, sharp against the sky."The carriage
can't get further, but you can go on, ladies, and I'll stop and gather
some blackberries for you."For brambles, gorse bushes, and clumps of fading heather, with one or
two small stunted trees, were now the only curiosities of this, King
Arthur's famed hunting castle, and hunting ground, which spread before
us for miles and miles.Passing a small farm-house, we made our way to
the building Charles pointed out, standing on the highest ridge of the
promontory, whose furthest point is the Land's End.Standing there, we
could see--or could have seen but that the afternoon had turned grey
and slightly misty--the ocean on both sides.Inland, the view seemed
endless.Roughtor and Brown Willy, two Dartmoor hills, are said to be
visible sometimes.Nearer, little white dots of houses show the mining
districts of Redruth and Camborne.A single wayfarer, looking like a
working man in his Sunday best going to visit friends, but evidently
tired, as if he had walked for miles, just glanced at us, and passed
on.We stood, all alone, on the very spot where many a time must have
stood King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Launcelot, and the other
knights--or the real human beings, whether barbarian or not, who formed
the originals of those mythical personages.Nothing was left but a common-place little tower,
built up of the fragments of the old castle, and a wide, pathless
moor, over which the wind sighed, and the mist crept.No memorial
whatever of King Arthur, except the tradition--which time and change
have been powerless to annihilate--that such a man once existed.The
long vitality which the legend keeps proves that he must have been
a remarkable man in his day.Romance itself cannot exist without a
foundation in reality.So I preached to my incredulous juniors, who threw overboard King
Arthur and took to blackberry-gathering; and to conversation with a
most comely Cornishwoman, milking the prettiest of Cornish cows in the
lonely farm-yard, which was the only sign of humanity for miles and
miles.We admired herself and her cattle; we drank her milk, offering
for it the usual payment.But the picturesque milkmaid shook her head
and demanded just double what even the dearest of London milk-sellers
would have asked for the quantity.Which sum we paid in silence,
and I only record the fact here in order to state that spite of our
foreboding railway friend at Falmouth, this was the only instance in
which we were ever "taken in," or in the smallest degree imposed upon,
in Cornwall.Another hour, slowly driving down the gradual <DW72> of the country,
through a mining district much more cheerful than that beyond Marazion.The mines were all apparently in full work, and the mining villages
were pretty, tidy, and cosy-looking, even picturesque.Ives the houses had quite a foreign look, but when we descended to
the town, its dark, narrow streets, pervaded by a "most ancient and
fish-like smell," were anything but attractive.As was our hotel, where, as a matter of duty, we ordered tea, but
doubted if we should enjoy it, and went out again to see what little
there seemed to be seen, puzzling our way through the gloomy and not
too fragrant streets, till at last in despair we stopped a bland,
elderly, Methodist-minister-looking gentleman, and asked him the way to
the sea."You're strangers here, ma'am?"I owned the humbling fact, as the inhabitant of St."And is it the pilchard fishery you want to see?A few pilchards have been seen already.There are the boats, the
fishermen are all getting ready.It's a fine sight to see them start.Would you like to come and look at them?"He had turned back and was walking with us down the street, pointing
out everything that occurred to him as noticeable, in the kindest and
civilest way.When we apologised for troubling him, and would have
parted company, our friend made no attempt to go."Oh, I've nothing at all to do, except"--he took out the biggest and
most respectable of watches--"except to attend a prayer-meeting at
half-past six.I should have time to show you the town; we think it is
a very nice little town.I ought to know it; I've lived in it, boy and
man for thirty-seven years.But now I have left my business to my sons,
and I just go about and amuse myself, looking into the shop now and
then just for curiosity.You must have seen my old shop, ladies, if you
came down that street."Which he named, and also gave us his own name, which we had seen over
the shop door, but I shall not record either.Not that I think the
honest man is ever likely to read such "light" literature as this book,
or to recall the three wanderers to whom he was so civil and kind, and
upon whom he poured out an amount of local and personal facts, which
we listened to--as a student of human nature is prone to do--with an
amused interest in which the comic verged on the pathetic.How large
to each man seems his own little world, and what child-like faith he
has in its importance to other people!I shall always recall our friend
at St.Ives, with his prayer-meetings, his chapel-goings--I concluded
he was a Methodist, a sect very numerous in Cornwall--his delight in
his successful shop and well-brought-up sons, who managed it so well,
leaving him to enjoy his _otium cum dignitate_--no doubt a municipal
dignity, for he showed us the Town Hall with great gusto.Evidently to
his honest, simple soul, St.By and by again he pulled out the turnip-like watch."Just ten minutes
to get to my prayer-meeting, and I never like to be late, I have been a
punctual man all my life, ma'am," added he, half apologetically, till
I suggested that this was probably the cause of his peace and success.Upon which he smiled, lifted his hat with a benign adieu, hoped we had
liked St.Ives--we had liked his company at any rate--and with a final
pointing across the street, "There's my shop, ladies, if you would care
to look at it," trotted away to his prayer-meeting.Ives, especially Tregenna, its
ancient mansion transformed into an hotel, is exceedingly pretty, but
night was falling fast, and we saw nothing.Speedily we despatched a
most untempting meal, and hurried Charles's departure, lest we should
be benighted, as we nearly were, during the long miles of straight and
unlovely road--the good road--between here and Penzance.We had done
our duty, we had seen the place, but as, in leaving it behind us, we
laughingly repeated the nursery rhyme, we came to the conclusion that
the man who was "_going_ to St.Ives" was the least fortunate of all
those notable individuals.DAY THE ELEVENTH


The last thing before retiring, we had glanced out on a gloomy sea, a
starless sky, pitch darkness, broken only by those moving lights on St.Michael's Mount, and thought anxiously of the morrow.It would be hard,
if after journeying thus far and looking forward to it so many years,
the day on which we went to the Land's End should turn out a wet day!Still "hope on, hope ever," as we used to write in our copy-books.Some
of us, I think, still go on writing it in empty air, and will do so
till the hand is dust.It was with a feeling almost of solemnity that we woke and looked out
on the dawn, grey and misty, but still not wet.To be just on the point
of gaining the wish of a life-time, however small, is a fact rare
enough to have a certain pathos in it.We slept again, and trusted
for the best, which by breakfast-time really came, in flickering
sun-gleams, and bits of hopeful blue sky.We wondered for the last
time, as we had wondered for half a century, "what the Land's End would
be like," and then started, rather thoughtful than merry, to find out
the truth of the case.Glad as we were to have for our expedition this quiet Sunday instead
of a tumultuous week day, conscience smote us in driving through
Penzance, with the church-bells ringing, and the people streaming along
to morning service, all in their Sunday best.Perhaps we might manage
to go to afternoon church at Sennen, or St.Sennen's, which we knew
by report, as the long-deceased father of a family we were acquainted
with had been curate there early in the century, and we had promised
faithfully "just to go and look at the old place."But one can keep Sunday sometimes even outside church-doors.I shall
never forget the Sabbatic peace of that day; those lonely and lovely
roads, first rich with the big trees and plentiful vegetation about
Penzance, then gradually growing barer and barer as we drove along the
high promontory which forms the extreme point westward of our island.The way along which so many tourist-laden vehicles pass daily was
now all solitary; we scarcely saw a soul, except perhaps a labourer
leaning over a gate in his decent Sunday clothes, or two or three
children trotting to school or church, with their books under their
arms.Unquestionably Cornwall is a respectable, sober-minded county;
religious-minded too, whether Methodist, Quaker, or other nonconformist
sects, of which there are a good many, or decent, conservative Church
of England.Buryan's--a curious old church founded on the place where
an Irishwoman, Saint Buriana, is said to have made her hermitage.A
few stray cottages comprised the whole village.There was nothing
special to see, except to drink in the general atmosphere of peace and
sunshine and solitude, till we came to Treryn, the nearest point to the
celebrated Logan or rocking-stone.From childhood we had read about it; the most remarkable specimen in
England of those very remarkable stones, whether natural or artificial,
who can decide?"Which the touch of a finger alone sets moving,
  But all earth's powers cannot shake from their base."Not quite true, this; since in 1824 a rash and foolish Lieutenant
Goldsmith (let his name be gibbeted for ever!)did come with a boat's
crew, and by main force remove the Logan a few inches from the point
on which it rests.Indignant justice very properly compelled him, at
great labour and pains, to put it back again, but it has never rocked
properly since.By Charles's advice we took a guide, a solemn-looking youth, who
stalked silently ahead of us along the "hedges," which, as at the
Lizard, furnished the regular path across the fields coastwards.Soon the gleaming circle of sea again flashed upon us, from behind a
labyrinth of rocks, whence we met a couple of tourists returning."You'll find it a pretty stiff climb to the Logan, ladies," said one of
them in answer to a question.And so we should have done, indeed, had not our guide's hand been
much readier than his tongue.I, at least, should never have got even
so far as that little rock-nest where I located myself--a somewhat
anxious-minded old hen--and watched my chickens climb triumphantly that
enormous mass of stone which we understood to be the Logan.they shouted across the dead stillness, the
lovely solitude of sky and sea.And I suppose it did rock, but must
honestly confess _I_ could not see it stir a single inch.However, it was a big stone, a very big stone, and the stones
around it were equally huge and most picturesquely thrown together.Also--delightful to my young folks!--they furnished the most
adventurous scramble that heart could desire.I alone felt a certain
relief when we were all again on smooth ground, with no legs or arms
broken.The cliff-walk between the Logan and the Land's End is said to be one
of the finest in England for coast scenery.Treryn or Treen Dinas,
Pardeneck Point, and Tol Pedn Penwith had been named as places we ought
to see, but this was impracticable.We had to content ourselves with a
dull inland road, across a country gradually getting more barren and
ugly, till we found ourselves suddenly at what seemed the back-yard of
a village public-house, where two or three lounging stable-men came
forward to the carriage, and Charles jumped down from his box.I forbear to translate the world of meaning implied in that brief
exclamation.Perhaps we shall admire the place more
when we have ceased to be hungry."The words of wisdom were listened to; and we spent our first quarter of
an hour at the Land's End in attacking a skeleton "remain" of not too
daintily-cooked beef, and a cavernous cheese, in a tiny back parlour
of the--let me give it its right name--First and Last Inn, of Great
Britain."We never provide for Sunday," said the waitress, responding to a
sympathetic question on the difficulty it must be to get food here."It's very seldom any tourists come on a Sunday."At which we felt altogether humbled; but in a few minutes more our
contrition passed into sovereign content.We went out of doors, upon the narrow green plateau in front of the
house, and then we recognised where we were--standing at the extreme
end of a peninsula, with a long line of rocks running out still further
into the sea.That "great and wide sea, wherein are moving things
innumerable," the mysterious sea "kept in the hollow of His hand," who
is Infinity, and looking at which, in the intense solitude and silence,
one seems dimly to guess at what Infinity may be.Any one who wishes to
go to church for once in the Great Temple which His hands have builded,
should spend a Sunday at the Land's End.At first, our thought had been, What in the world shall we do here for
two mortal hours!Now, we wished we had had two whole days.A sunset, a
sunrise, a star-lit night, what would they not have been in this grand
lonely place--almost as lonely as a ship at sea?It would be next best
to finding ourselves in the middle of the Atlantic.But this bliss could not be; so we proceeded to make the best of what
we had.The bright day was darkening, and a soft greyness began to
creep over land and sea.No, not soft, that is the very last adjective
applicable to the Land's End.Even on that calm day there was a fresh
wind--there must be always wind--and the air felt sharper and more salt
than any sea-air I ever knew.Stimulating too, so that one's nerves
were strung to the highest pitch of excitement.We felt able to do
anything, without fear and without fatigue.So that when a guide came
forward--a regular man-of-war's-man he looked--we at once resolved to
adventure along the line of rocks, seaward, "out as far as anybody was
accustomed to go.""Ay, ay; I'll take you, ladies.That is--the young ladies might go--but
you--" eying me over with his keen sailor's glance, full of honesty and
good humour, "you're pretty well on in years, ma'am."Laughing, I told him how far on, but that I was able to do a good deal
yet."Oh, I've taken ladies much older than you.One the other day was
nearly seventy.So we'll do our best, ma'am.He offered a rugged, brown hand, as firm and steady as a mast, to hold
by, and nothing could exceed the care and kindliness with which he
guided every step of every one of us, along that perilous path, that
is, perilous except for cautious feet and steady heads.If you make one false step, you are done
for," said our guide, composedly as he pointed to the boiling whirl of
waters below.[Illustration: THE LAND'S END AND THE LOGAN ROCK.]Still, though a narrow and giddy path, there was a path, and the
exploit, though a little risky, was not fool-hardy.We should have
been bitterly sorry not to have done it--not to have stood for one
grand ten minutes, where in all our lives we may never stand again, at
the farthest point where footing is possible, gazing out upon that
magnificent circle of sea which sweeps over the submerged "land of
Lyonesse," far, far away, into the wide Atlantic.There were just two people standing with us, clergymen evidently, and
one, the guide told us, was "the parson at St.We spoke to
him, as people do speak, instinctively, when mutually watching such a
scene, and by and by we mentioned the name of the long-dead curate of
St.The "parson" caught instantly at the name.Oh, yes, my father knew him quite well.He used constantly
to walk across from Sennen to our house, and take us children long
rambles across the cliffs, with a volume of Southey or Wordsworth under
his arm.He was a fine young fellow in those days, I have heard, and an
excellent clergyman.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from
the north somewhere."The "nice girl" was now a sweet silver-haired little
lady of nearly eighty; the "fine young fellow" had long since departed;
and the boy was this grave middle-aged gentleman, who remembered both
as a tradition of his youth.What a sermon it all preached, beside this
eternal rock, this ever-moving, never-changing sea!But time was passing--how fast it does pass, minutes, ay, and years!We
bade adieu to our known unknown friend, and turned our feet backwards,
cautiously as ever, stopping at intervals to listen to the gossip of
our guide."Yes, ladies, that's the spot--you may see the hoof-mark--where General
Armstrong's horse fell over; he just slipped off in time, but the poor
beast was drowned.And here, over that rock, happened the most curious
thing.I wouldn't have believed it myself, only I knew a man that saw
it with his own eyes.Once a bullock fell off into the pool below
there--just look, ladies."(We did look, into a perfect Maelstrom of
boiling waves.)"Everybody thought he was drowned, till he was seen
swimming about unhurt.They fished him up, and exhibited him as a
curiosity."And again, pointing to a rock far out in the sea.Thirty years ago a ship went to pieces there, and
the captain and his wife managed to climb on to that rock.They held
on there for two days and a night, before a boat could get at them.At last they were taken off one at a time, with rockets and a rope;
the wife first.But the rope slipped and she fell into the water.She
was pulled out in a minute or so, and rowed ashore, but they durst
not tell her husband she was drowned.I was standing on the beach at
Whitesand Bay when the boat came in.I was only a lad, but I remember
it well, and her too lifted out all dripping and quite dead."They went back for him, and got him off safe, telling him nothing.But
when he found she was dead he went crazy-like--kept for ever saying,
'She saved my life, she saved my life,' till he was taken away by his
friends.Look out, ma'am, mind your footing; just here a lady slipped
and broke her leg a week ago.I had to carry her all the way to the
hotel.We all smiled at the comical candour of the honest sailor, who
proceeded to give us bits of his autobiography.He was Cornish born,
but had seen a deal of the world as an A.B.on board her Majesty's ship
_Agamemnon_."Of course you have heard of the _Agamemnon_, ma'am.I was in her off
Balaklava.His eyes brightened as we discussed names and places once
so familiar, belonging to that time, which now seems so far back as to
be almost historical."Then you know what a winter we had, and what a summer afterwards.I
came home invalided, and didn't attempt the service afterwards; but I
never thought I should come home at all.Yes, it's a fine place the
Land's End, though the air is so strong that it kills some folks right
off.Once an invalid gentleman came, and he was dead in a fortnight.But I'm not dead yet, and I stop here mostly all the year round."He sniffed the salt air and smiled all over his weather-beaten
face--keen, bronzed, blue-eyed, like one of the old Vikings.He was a
fine specimen of a true British tar.When, having seen all we could, we
gave him his small honorarium, he accepted it gratefully, and insisted
on our taking in return a memento of the place in the shape of a stone
weighing about two pounds, glittering with ore, and doubtless valuable,
but ponderous.Oh, the trouble it gave me to carry it home, and pack
and unpack it among my small luggage!But I did bring it home, and
I keep it still in remembrance of the Land's End, and of the honest
sailor of H.M.S.We could dream of an unknown Land's End no more.It
became now a real place, of which the reality, though different from
the imagination, was at least no disappointment.How few people in
attaining a life-long desire can say as much!Our only regret, an endurable one now, was that we had not carried out
our original plan of staying some days there--tourist-haunted, troubled
days they might have been, but the evenings and mornings would have
been glorious.With somewhat heavy hearts we summoned Charles and the
carriage, for already a misty drift of rain began sweeping over the sea."Still, we must see Whitesand Bay," said one of us, recalling a story
a friend had once told how, staying at Land's End, she crossed the bay
alone in a blinding storm, took refuge at the coastguard station, where
she was hospitably received, and piloted back with most chivalric care
by a coastguard, who did not tell her till their journey's end that he
had left at home a wife, and a baby just an hour old.We only caught a glimmer of the
bay through drizzling rain, which by the time we reached Sennen village
had become a regular downpour.Evidently, we could do no more that day,
which was fast melting into night."We'll go home," was the sad resolve, glad nevertheless that we had a
comfortable "home" to go to.So closing the carriage and protecting ourselves as well as we could
from the driving rain, we went forward, passing the Quakers' burial
ground, where is said to be one of the finest views in Cornwall; the
Nine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting
things, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the
rising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might
be, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land's End!It is in great things as in small, the
worry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.We
have done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.DAY THE TWELFTH


Monday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing
that by the week's end our travels must be over and done, and that if
we wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next
morning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which
involved taking this night "a long, a last farewell" of our comfortable
carriage and our faithful Charles."But it needn't be until night," said he, evidently loth to part from
his ladies."If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,
master will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like
to-day.""Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,
then he'll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o'clock
to get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it's a good road, though
rather lonely."I should think it was, in the "wee hours" by the dim light of a waning
moon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,
but decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard's Head,
Lamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on
no account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with
scientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen
a single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of
that magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the
day.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE."I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,
and I couldn't get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn't trouble anybody very much, mightn't we go again to
Whitesand Bay?"It was a heavenly day; to spend it
in delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a
rest for the next day's fatigue.there
would be no temptation to put on miners' clothes, and go dangling in
a basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was
reported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but
some of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper
air.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had "no
time" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard's Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a
second view of the Land's End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we
made various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never
had the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that
we could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone
through England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always
seemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient
church and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me
some ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark
"Sennen" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,
released for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,
weighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling
to their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of
the "fine young fellow" half a century ago.As we passed through the
village with its pretty cottages and "Lodgings to Let," we could not
help thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for
a large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the
carriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,
gradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was
almost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking
yourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a
paradise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about
like sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,
shallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed
before reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious
one, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight."Folks ne'er bathe here.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we
quite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such
a splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,
and the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary
figure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless
a human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--maternal
wisdom was reproached as arrant cowardice.But the sand was delicious,
the sea-wind so fresh, and the sea so bright, that disappointment could
not last.We made an encampment of our various impedimenta, stretched
ourselves out, and began the search for shells, in which every
arm's-length involved a mine of wealth and beauty.Never except at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I
seen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very
minute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin's head.The
collecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical
interests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King
Stephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have
landed here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over
by Tennyson in "Maud"--"small, but a work divine"?I think infinite
greatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the
exceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,
who can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a
glow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.The only imperfection in
creation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for
dreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur
of the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and
breaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed
impossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his
wife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all
his other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the
Land's End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful
we felt that we had "done" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased
to have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the
Armed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make
out which was the knight and which was the lady.Can it be that some
fragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a "fish-cellar," a
little group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable
farewell of the Land's End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled
or thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it
was another thing to carry them up again.I went in quest of a small
boy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only
unemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent
air for not having "cleaned" himself, that I almost blushed to ask
him to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But
he accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most
graphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,
making a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with
two moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own
accord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a
group of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me
how many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what
hard work it was.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she
liked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at
Sennen.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I
had parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in
time to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus
belli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser
people can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the
strong hand of "intervention"--civilised intervention--was best, and
put an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore
sum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent
reason that I couldn't do it myself!)Therefore I
conclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as
their fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to
Penzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of tourists, for
the swarm at the Land's End seldom goes near Whitesand Bay.Existence
here must be very much that of an oyster,--but perhaps oysters are
happy.By the time we reached Penzance the lovely day was dying into an
equally lovely evening.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was
quite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of
Marazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign
princess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an
interest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,
with the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,
a year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von
Pawel-Rammingen, her father's secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval
knight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.Michael's
Mount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.Half
the town must have turned out to the beach, and the other half secured
every available boat, in which it followed, at respectful distance,
the two boats, one full of luggage, the other of human beings, which
were supposed to be the royal party.People speculated with earnest
curiosity, which was the princess, and which her husband, and what the
St.Aubyns would do with them; whether they would be taken to see the
Land's End, and whether they would go there as ordinary tourists, or in
a grand visit of state.How hard it is that royal folk can never see
anything except in state, or in a certain adventitious garb, beautiful,
no doubt, but satisfactorily hiding the real thing.How they must long
sometimes for a walk, after the fashion of Haroun Alraschid, up and
down Regent Street and Oxford Street!or an incognito foreign tour, or
even a solitary country walk, without a "lady-in-waiting."We had no opera-glass to add to the many levelled at those two boats,
so we went in--hoping host and guests would spend a pleasant evening in
the lovely old rooms we knew.We spent ours in rest, and in arranging
for to-morrow's flight.Also in consulting with our kindly landlady
as to a possible house at Marazion for some friends whom the winter
might drive southwards, like the swallows, to a climate which, in this
one little bay shut out from east and north, is--they told us--during
all the cruel months which to many of us means only enduring life, not
living--as mild and equable almost as the Mediterranean shores.And
finally, we settled all with our faithful Charles, who looked quite
mournful at parting with his ladies."Yes, it is rather a long drive, and pretty lonely," said he."But I'll
wait till the moons up, and that'll help us.We'll get into Falmouth
by daylight.I've got to do the same thing often enough through the
summer, so I don't mind it."Thus said the good fellow, putting a cheery face on it, then with a
hasty "Good-bye, ladies," he rushed away.But we had taken his address,
not meaning to lose sight of him.(Nor have we done so up to this date
of writing; and the fidelity has been equal on both sides.)Then, in the midst of a peal of bells which was kept up unweariedly
till 10 P.M.--evidently Marazion is not blessed with the sight
of a princess every day--we closed our eyes upon all outward things,
and went away to the Land of Nod.DAY THE THIRTEENTH


Into King Arthurs land--Tintagel his birth-place, and Camelford,
where he fought his last battle--the legendary region of which one
may believe as much or as little as one pleases--we were going
to-day.With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had
accompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged
all before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped
to find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King
Mark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at
an inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we
left behind us at Marazion.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the
prettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed
with.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but
in all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine
scarcely ever failed us.Ives
Bay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded
country near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the
glittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then
darting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,
the little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its
representative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the
ancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to
change from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,
till we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;
a huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of
accommodating a whole family and its luggage.We missed our compact
little machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled
ourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather
more, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely
quiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere
rode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King
Arthur's death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,
"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with
the "Morte d'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better
briefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the
edification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of
the duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel
and Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto
whom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried
away, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good
knight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened
Arthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was
recognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead
of Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round
Table, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed
virtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married
Guinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love
of Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,
his best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a
rebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his
end was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry
him to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in
there his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,
who lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across
the mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was
afterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still
in fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order
of Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will
then be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but
a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country
towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers'
shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but
solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and
their backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of
these said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a
mild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau's _Deerbrook_,
or Miss Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they
have probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to
rest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little
river Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King
Arthur's army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A
slab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called
"King Arthur's Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his
Round Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,
the bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head
of Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of
Davidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is
called "King Arthur's grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to
choose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and
believe in Arthur's disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,

  "To the island-valley of Avillion...
  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a
virtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,
with the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend
of Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his
dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to
the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing
round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still
lingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and
horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;
flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human
foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and
we might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash
of the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;
and pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la
Faye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could
desire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,
piled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them
hills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever
since the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,
everything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or
other colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for
vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,
the result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful
atmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,
steam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back
again.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make
the little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the
said tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a
street, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old
post-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were
amused to find we had to get ready for a _table d'hote_ dinner, in
the only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,
a comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,
served us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and
pleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does
not always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,
or Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights
in the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway
which now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to
confirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself
and his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married
to the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we
thought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk
on the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning
against a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the
many grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of
Tintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,
the sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear
amber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where
sea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low
cloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures
sitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very
moderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long
black thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it's King
Arthur's luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and
went home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--


And all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and
not spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished
to stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all
is--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,
yet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love
between two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered
that we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark
and Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the
briefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch
home Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,
her handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal
result; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where
he married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,
till, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he
implored to come to him.A tale--of which
the only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of
the second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern
poets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly
story, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the
scarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a
curious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just
because he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand
wrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should
ever have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps
Tennyson's Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory's,
founded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all
the mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,
honour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of
woman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at
that hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the
days when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,
all with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have
existed in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we
could not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining
down the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that
goodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from
whom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot
climb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite
direction to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks
the beam.While waiting for
the tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding
path, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of
rock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,
ourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down
into, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach
the shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not
tourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the
narrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack
over his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the
least notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted
each to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,
it was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove
three times a day.They all had their
names; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its
long ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young
and some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of 'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a
sort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for
that; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I'd be glad to bring you
some, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we
explained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way
to London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then
bidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the
busy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He
might have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth's "Leech-gatherer
on the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall
certainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in
the afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at
the end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe
shelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high
footpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of
sea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and
legends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux
Castle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells
had been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached
the cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe
voyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on
board--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter
nights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the
depths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by
minute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we
moralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people
have, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the
Almighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,
dragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,
instead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious
and even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely
reconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we
drove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel
black in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,
and there was nothing left but to

  "Watch the twilight stars come out
    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the
beach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin's feet
"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was
to grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were
all about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly
up the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and
descended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Other
ruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King
Uther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful
natural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur's cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing
in the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some
holes in the slate rock."And up there you'll find the chapel.It's an
easy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making
a verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the
unknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for
offence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on
still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside
it.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those
long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,
fought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it
can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time.However,
there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys
so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is
a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost
anything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one
obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,
seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed
to behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate
formation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of
the tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,
and gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become
sea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it
does still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and
actual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of
Tintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into
an island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,
Ygrayne's husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin
fortresses were habitable till Elizabeth's time, there is evidence to
prove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep
and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in
whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the
familiar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two
tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about
in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough
or a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and
scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky
hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron
gate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel
we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves
beyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had
found in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is
one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this
wonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves
once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John
Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby
waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat
went dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it
presently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied
his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all
the while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,
unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had
to be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts
of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click
of their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in
summer.In winter--

"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it," said our man, who was
intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a
time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a
cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The
gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;
but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it
young."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds'
eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said.Hold on,
mate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out
of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking
on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow
that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;
while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of
the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from
which no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don't like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn't we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to
return; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,
compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as
nothing.Yet with its
terror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two
minutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into
daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic
overhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world
shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself
on my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not
to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see
it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in
quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building
dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,
and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude
Haven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild
September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited
country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of
it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round
and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about
half-a-mile off."There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied
records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads,
said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little
boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's
country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it
alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of
Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the
bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in
short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian
legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of
barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere
idea of such a hero as that ideal knight

  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:
  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:
  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"

rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the
descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died
among us in this very nineteenth century--

  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"

if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L'ENVOI


Written more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have
long been safe at home.A dense December fog creeps in everywhere,
choking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent
days, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our
Unsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,
like Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius,
may see "nothing in it"--a few kindly readers looking a little further,
may see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole.But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would
call "a good time," the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far
forward, even into that quiet time "when travelling days are done."LONDON:

  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C.It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George
said, "You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?""No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped
the 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the
nasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play
with powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.""Well, we must take it out in marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh."No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!""I have
some 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of

this afternoon and get them."The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,
coming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his
bright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,
he heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,
schoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy."I ran after you all the way," he pantingly said."I want to tell you,
dear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as
anything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and
I feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable
court martial.""There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!"was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion."It
was my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how
silly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.""Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so
we will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this
abominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the
following day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in
history for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran
poor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible
variety of exercise known to "Hardee's Tactics," and nearly dislocated
their shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward
all at once when they went at "double quick;" at the same time keeping
the other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful
operation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered
down nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and
a special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!"meant "shoulder arms," and when "order arms" (or bringing
all the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never
was such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and
not a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of
the day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.I wish we hadn't done it now, for
he has proved more of a hindrance than a help, and his real
knowledge of fauna and flora could be put in a peanut shell, with
room to spare.""He's a big brag," answered Tom."Take my advice and never trust
him too far--or you may be sorry for it."Presently Aleck came back, with Cujo following.The brawny
African began at once to examine the footprints along the lake
shore.Udder footprints walk away, but not um Massah Dick."Do you think he--fell into the lake?""Perhaps, Massah Tom--or maybe he get into boat.""I don't know of any boats around here--do
you?""No," returned the young man from Yale."But the natives living
in the vicinity may have them.""Perhaps a native dun carry him off," said Aleck."He must be
sumwhar, dat am certain.""Yes, he must be somewhere," repeated Tom sadly.By this time Sam and Randolph Rover were coming up, and also one
of Dick Chester's friends.The college students were introduced
to the others by Tom, and then a general hunt began for Dick,
which lasted until the shades of night had fallen.But poor Dick
was not found, and all wondered greatly what had, become of him.Tom and the others retired at ten o'clock.But not to sleep, for
with Dick missing none of the Rovers could close an eye."We must
find him in the morning," said Sam.CHAPTER XXV

DICK AND THE LION


When poor Dick came to his senses he was lying in a heap on the
decayed leaves at the bottom of the hollow between the rocks.The
stuff Josiah Crabtree had thrown down still lay on top, of him,
and it was a wonder that he had not been smothered.was the first thought which crossed his
confused mind.He tried to sit up, but found this impossible
until he had scattered the dead leaves and tree branches.Even
then he was so bewildered that he hardly knew what to do,
excepting to stare around at his strange surroundings.Slowly the
truth dawned upon him--how Josiah Crabtree had struck him down
on the lake shore."He must have brought me here," he murmured.Although Dick did not know it, he had been at the bottom of the
hollow all evening and all night.The sun was now up once more,
but it was a day later than he imagined.The hollow was damp and full of ants and other insects, and as
soon as he felt able the youth got up.There was a big lump
behind his left ear where the stick had descended, and this hurt
not a little."I'll get square with him some day," he muttered, as he tried to
crawl out of the hollow."He has more courage to play the villain
than I gave him credit for.Sometime I'll face him again, and
then things will be different."It was no easy matter to get out of the hollow.The sides were
steep and slippery, and four times poor Dick tried, only to slip
back to the bottom.He was about to try a fifth time, when a
sound broke upon his ears which caused him great alarm.From only
a short distance away came the muffled roar of a lion.Dick had never heard, this sound out in the open before, but he
had heard it a number of times at the circus and at the menagerie
in Central Park, New York, and he recognized the roar only too
well.I trust he isn't coming this
way!"But he was coming that way, as Dick soon discovered.A few
seconds of silence were followed by another roar which to, the
alarmed youth appeared to come from almost over his head.Then
came a low whine, which was kept up for fully a minute, followed
by another roar.Dick hardly knew what was best--to remain at
the bottom of the hollow or try to escape to some tree at the top
of the opening."If I go up now he may nab me on sight," he
thought dismally."Oh, if only I had my--thank Heaven, I have!"Dick had felt for his pistol before, to find it gone.But now he
spotted the glint of the shiny barrel among the leaves.The
weapon had fallen from his person at the time Crabtree had pitched
him into the hollow.He reached for it, and to his joy found that
it was fully loaded and ready for use.Presently he heard the bushes overhead thrust aside, and then came
a half roar, half whine that made him jump.Looking up, he saw a
lion standing on the edge of the hollow facing him.The monarch of the forest was holding one of his forepaws up and
now he sat down on his haunches to lick the limb.Then he set up
another whine and shook the limb painfully."He has hurt that paw," thought Dick.Yes, he did see, just at that instant, and started back in
astonishment.Then his face took on a fierce look and he gave a
roar which could be heard for miles around.It was the report of Dick's pistol, but the youth was
nervous, and the bullet merely glanced along the lion's body,
doing little or no damage.The beast roared again, then crouched
down and prepared to leap upon the youth.But the wounded forepaw was a hindrance to the lion's movements,
and he began to crawl along the hollow's edge, seeking a better
point from which to make a leap.Then Dick's pistol spoke up a second time.This shot was a far better one, and the bullet passed directly
through the knee-joint of the lion's left forepaw.He was now
wounded in both fore limbs, and set up a roar which seemed to
fairly make the jungle tremble.Twice he started to leap down
into the hollow, but each time retreated to shake one wounded limb
after another into the air with whines of pain and distress.As soon as the great beast reappeared once more Dick continued his
firing.Soon his pistol was empty, but the lion had not been hit
again.In nervous haste the lad started to re-load only to find
that his cartridge box was empty.he yelled at the lion, and threw a stone at the beast.But the lion was now determined to descend into the hollow, and
paused only to calculate a sure leap to the boy's head.But that pause, brief as it was, was fatal to the calculations of
the monarch of the jungle.From his rear came two shots in rapid
succession, each hitting him in a vulnerable portion of his body.He leaped up into the air, rolled over on the edge of the hollow,
and then came down, head first, just grazing Dick's arm, and
landing at the boy's feet, stone dead."And so did I," came from Randolph Rover.cried Dick, with all the strength he could
command.He was shaking like a reed in the wind and all of the
color had deserted his face."I told you that I had heard several
pistol shots."Rover presented themselves at the top of the
hollow, followed by Aleck and Cujo.The latter procured a rope
made of twisted vines, and by this Dick was raised up without much
difficulty.CHAPTER XXVI

THE LAST OF JOSIAH CRABTREE


All listened intently to the story Dick had to tell, and he had
not yet finished when Dick Chester presented himself, having been
attracted to the vicinity by the roars of the lion and the various
pistol and gun shots."This Crabtree must certainly be as bad as you represent," he
said."I will have a talk with him when I get back to our camp.""It won't be necessary for you to talk to him," answered Dick
grimly."If you'll allow me, I'll do the talking."Chester and Cujo descended into the hollow to examine the lion.There was a bullet in his right foreleg which Chester proved had
come from his rifle."He must be the beast Frank Rand and I fired
at from across the lake.Probably he had his home in the hollow
and limped over to it during the night.""In that case you are entitled to your fair share of the meat--if
you wish any," said Randolph Rover with a smile."But I think
the pelt goes to Tom, for he fired the shot that was really
fatal."And that skin did go to Tom, and lies on his parlor floor
at home today."Several of the students from Yale had been out on a long tour the
afternoon before, in the direction, of the mountain, and they had
reported meeting several natives who had seen King Susko.He was
reported to have but half a dozen of his tribe with him, including
a fellow known as Poison Eye."That's a bad enough title for anybody," said Sam with a shudder."I suppose his job is to poison their enemies if they can't
overcome them in regular battle.""Um tell de thruf," put in Cujo."Once de Mimi tribe fight King
Susko, and whip him.Den Susko send Poison Eye to de Mimi camp.Next day all drink-water get bad, an' men, women, an' children die
off like um flies.""And why didn't they slay the poisoner?""Eberybody 'fraid to touch him--'fraid he be poisoned.""I'd run my chances--providing I had a knife or a club,"
muttered Tom."Such rascals are not fit to live."Dick, as can readily be imagined, was hungry, and before the party
started back for the lake, the youth was provided with some food
which Aleck had very thoughtfully carried with him.It was learned that the two parties were encamped not far apart,
and Dick Chester said he would bring his friends to, see them
before the noon hour was passed."I don't believe he will bring Josiah Crabtree," said Tom."I
reckon Crabtree will take good care to keep out of sight."When Chester came over with his friends he said
that the former teacher of Putnam Hall was missing, having left
word that he was going around the lake to look for a certain
species of flower which so far they had been unable to add to
their specimens."But he will have to come back," said the Vale student."He has
no outfit with which to go it alone."Crabtree put in an appearance just before the sun
set over the jungle to the westward.He presented a most woebegone
appearance, having fallen into a muddy swamp on his face."I--I met with an--an unfortunate accident," he said to
Chester."I fell into the--ahem--mud, and it was only with
great difficulty that I managed to--er--to extricate myself.""Josiah Crabtree, you didn't expect to see me here, did you?"said
Dick sternly, as he stepped forward.And then the others of his
party also came out from where they had been hiding in the brush.The former teacher of Putnam Hall started as if confronted by a
ghost."Why--er--where did you come from, Rover?""You know well enough where I came from, Josiah Crabtree," cried
Dick wrathfully."You dropped me into the hollow for dead, didn't
you!""Why, I--er--that--is--" stammered Crabtree; but could
actually go no further."Don't waste words on him, Dick," put in Tom."Give him the
thrashing he deserves.""If we were in America I would
have you locked up.But out here we must take the law into our
own hands.I am going to thrash you to the very best of my
ability, and after that, if I meet you again I'll--I'll--"

"Dun shoot him on sight," suggested Aleck."Chester--Rand--will you not aid me against this--er--savage
young brute?""Don't you call Dick a brute," put in Sam."If there is any brute here it is you, and everyone in our party
will back up what I say."Crabtree, I have nothing to say in this matter," said Dick
Chester."It would seem that your attack on Rover was a most
atrocious one, and out here you will have to take what punishment
comes.""But you will help me, won't you, Rand?"pleaded the former
teacher, nervously."No, I shall stand by Chester," answered Rand."And will you, too, see me humiliated?"asked Crabtree, turning to
the other Yale students."I, the head of your expedition into
equatorial Africa!"Crabtree, we may as well come to an understanding," said one
of the students, a heavyset young man named Sanders."We hired
you to do certain work for us, and we paid you well for that work.Since we left America you have found fault with nearly everything,
and in a good many instances which I need not recall just now you
have not done as you agreed.You are not the learned scientist
you represented yourself to be--instead, if we are to believe
our newly made friends here, you are a pretender, a big sham, and
a brute in the bargain.This being so, we intend to dispense with
your services from this day forth.We will pay you what is coming
to you, give you your share of our outfit, and then you can go
your way and we will go ours.We absolutely want nothing more to
do with you."This long speech on Sanders' part was delivered amid a deathlike
silence.As the student went on, Josiah Crabtree bit his lip
until the blood came.Once his baneful eyes fairly flashed fire
at Sanders and then at Dick Rover, but then they fell to the
ground."And so you--ahem--throw me off," he said, drawing a long
breath.But I demand all that is coming to me.""And a complete outfit, so that I can make my way back to the
coast.""All that is coming to you--no more and no less," said Sanders
firmly."But he shan't go without that thrashing!"cried Dick, and
catching up a long whip he had had Cujo cut for him he leaped upon
Josiah Crabtree and brought down the lash with stinging effect
across the former teacher's face, leaving a livid mark that
Crabtree was doomed to wear to the day of his death.And there is another for the way you treated Stanhope, and
another for what you did to Dora, and one for Tom, and another for
Sam, and another--"

"Oh!shrieked Crabtree, trying
to run away."Don't--I will be cut to pieces!And as the lash came down over his head, neck, and shoulders, he
danced madly around in pain.At last he broke for cover and
disappeared, not to show himself again until morning, when he
called Chester to him, asked for and received, what was coming to
him, and departed, vowing vengeance on the Rovers and all of the
others."He will remember you for that, Dick," said Sam, when the affair
was over."Let him be--I am not afraid of him," responded the elder
brother.CHAPTER XXVII

THE JOURNEY TO THE MOUNTAIN


By noon of the day following the Rover expedition was on its way
to the mountain said to be so rich in gold.The students from
Yale went with them."It's like a romance, this search after your father," said Chester
to Dick.You can rest assured that our
party will do all we can for you.Specimen hunting is all well
enough, but man hunting is far more interesting.""I would like to go on a regular hunt for big game some day," said
Tom.He had already mentioned Mortimer Blaze to the Yale
students."Yes, that's nice--if you are a crack shot, like Sanders.He
can knock the spots from a playing card at a hundred yards.""Maybe he's a Western boy," laughed Sam.His father owns a big cattle ranch there, and Sanders
learned to shoot while rounding up cattle.He's a tip-top
fellow."They had passed over a small plain and were now working along a
series of rough rocks overgrown with scrub brush and creeping
vines full of thorns.The thorns stuck everybody but Cujo, who
knew exactly how to avoid them."Ise dun got scratched in'steen thousand places," groaned Aleck."Dis am worse dan a bramble bush twice ober, by golly!"For two days the united expeditions kept on their way up the
mountain side,  which sloped gradually at its base, the steeper
portion still being several days' journey distant.During these days they shot several wild animals including a
beautiful antelope, while Sam caught a monkey.But the monkey bit
the boy in the shoulder, and Sam was glad enough to get rid of the
mischievous creature.On the afternoon of the second day Cujo, who was slightly in
advance of the others, called a halt."Two men ahead ob us, up um mountain," he said."Cujo Vink one of
dern King Susko."The discovery was talked over for a few minutes, and it was
decided that Cujo should go ahead, accompanied by Randolph Rover
and Dick.The others were to remain on guard for anything which
might turn up.Dick felt his heart beat rapidly as he advanced with his uncle and
the African guide through the tangle of thorns and over the rough
rocks.He felt that by getting closer to King Susko, he was also
getting closer to the mystery which surrounded his father's
disappearance."See, da is gwine up
into a big hole in de side ob de mountain?""Can you make out if it is Susko or not?""Not fo' certain, Massah Dick.But him belong to de Burnwo tribe,
an' de udder man too.""If they are all alone it will be an easy matter to capture them,"
said Randolph Rover."All told, we are twelve to two.""Come on, and we'll soon know something worth knowing, I feel
certain of it."Cujo now asked that he be allowed to proceed alone, to make
certain that no others of the Burnwo tribe were in the vicinity."We must be werry careful," he said."Burnwos kill eberybody wot
da find around here if not dare people.""Evidently they want to keep the whole mountain of gold to
themselves," observed Dick."All right, Cujo, do as you think
best--I know we can rely upon you."After this they proceeded with more care than ever-along a rocky
edge covered with loose stones.To one side was the mountain, to
the other a sheer descent of several hundred feet, and the
footpath was not over a yard wide."A tumble here would be a serious matter," said Randolph Rover."Take good care, Dick, that you don't step on a rolling stone."But the ledge was passed in safety, and in fifteen minutes more
they were close to the opening is the side of the mountain.It
was an irregular hole about ten feet wide and twice as high.The
a rocks overhead stuck out for several yards, and from these hung
numerous vines, forming a sort of Japanese curtain over the
opening.While the two Rovers waited behind a convenient rock, Cujo crawled
forward on his hand and knees into the cave.They waited for ten
minutes, just then it seemed an hour, but he did not reappear."He is taking his time," whispered Dick."Perhaps something has happened to him," returned Randolph Rover."I've had my pistol ready all along," answered the boy, exhibiting
the weapon."That encounter with the lion taught me a lesson.Dick broke off short, for a sound on the rocks above the cave
entrance had reached his ears.Both gazed in the direction, but
could see nothing."I heard a rustling in the bushes up there perhaps, though, it was
only a bird or some small animal.""Neither can I; but I am certain--Out of sight, Uncle Randolph,
quick!"Dick caught his uncle by the arm, and both threw themselves flat
behind the rocks.Scarcely had they gone down than two spears
came whizzing forward, one hitting the rocks and the other sailing
over their heads and burying itself in a tree trunk several yards
away.They caught a glance of two natives on the rocks over them,
but with the launching of the spears the Africans disappeared.CHAPTER XXVIII

KING SUSKO


"My gracious, this is getting at close range!"burst out Dick,
when he could catch his breath again."Uncle Randolph, they meant
to kill us!"Take care that they do not spear
you."No reply came back to this call, which was several times repeated.Then came a crash, as a big stone was hurled down, to split into a
score of pieces on the rock which sheltered them."They mean to dislodge us," said Dick."If they would only show
themselves--"

He stopped, for he had seen one of the Bumwos peering over a mass
of short brush directly over the cave entrance.Taking hasty aim
with his pistol be fired.A yell of pain followed, proving that the African had been hit.But the Bumwo was not seriously wounded, and soon he sent another
stone at them, this time hitting Randolph Rover on the leg.gasped Dick's uncle, and drew up that member with a wry
face."Did he hurt you much, Uncle Randolph?"And now the man
fired, but the bullet flew wide of its mark, for Randolph Rover
had practiced but little with firearms.They now thought it time to retreat, and, watching their chance,
they ran from the rocks to the trees beyond.While they were
exposed another spear was sent after them, cutting its way through
Mr.Rover's hat brim and causing that gentleman to turn as pale as
a sheet."A few inches closer and it would have been my head!"Perhaps we
had better rejoin the others, Dick."The shots had alarmed the others of the expedition, and all were
hurrying along the rocky ledge when Randolph Rover and Dick met
them."If you go ahead
we may be caught in an ambush.The Bumwos have discovered our
presence and mean to kill us if they can!"Suddenly a loud, deep voice broke upon them, coming from the rocks
over the cave entrance."This
country belongs to the Bumwos."I am King Susko, chief of the Bumwos.""Will you come and have a talk with us?"Want the white man to leave," answered the
African chief, talking in fairly good English."We do not wish to quarrel with you, King Susko; but you will find
it best for you if you will grant us an interview," went on
Randolph Rover."The white man must go away from this mountain.I will not talk
with him," replied the African angrily."To rob the Bumwos of their gold.""No; we are looking for a lost man, one who came to this country
years ago and one who was your prisoner--"

"The white man is no longer here--he went home long time ago.""You have him a prisoner, and
unless you deliver him up you shall suffer dearly for it."This threat evidently angered the African chief greatly, for
suddenly a spear was launched at the boy, which pierced Tom's
shoulder.As Tom went down, a shout went up from the rocks, and suddenly a
dozen or more Bumwos appeared, shaking their spears and acting as
if they meant to rush down on the party below without further
warning.CHAPTER XXIX

THE VILLAGE ON THE MOUNTAIN


"Tom is wounded!"He ran to his brother, to find the
blood flowing freely over Tom's shoulder."I--I guess not," answered Tom with a gasp of pain.Then, as
full of pluck as usual, Tom raised his pistol and fired, hitting
one of the Bumwos in the breast and sending him to the rear,
seriously wounded.It was evident that Cujo had been mistaken and that there were far
more of their enemies around the mountain than they had
anticipated.From behind the Rover expedition a cry arose,
telling that more of the natives were coming from that direction."We are being hemmed in," said Dick Chester nervously."No, let us make a stand," came from Rand."I think a concerted
volley from our pistols and guns will check their movements."It was decided to await the closer approach of the Bumwos, and
each of the party improved the next minute in seeing to it that
his weapon was ready for use.Suddenly a blood-curdling yell arose on the sultry air, and the
Bumwos were seen to be approaching from two directions, at right
angles to each other.cried Dick Rover, and began to fire at one
of the approaching forces.The fight that followed was, however, short and full of
consternation to the Africans.One of the parties was led by King
Susko himself, and the chief had covered less than half the
distance to where the Americans stood when a bullet from Tom
Rover's pistol reached him, wounding him in the thigh and causing
him to pitch headlong on the grass.The fall of the leader made the Africans set up a howl of dismay,
and instead of keeping up the fight they gathered around their
leader.Then, as the Americans continued to fire, they picked
King Susko up and ran off with him.A few spears were hurled at
our friends, but the whole battle, to use Sam's way of summing up
afterward, was a regular "two-for-a-cent affair."Soon the Bumwos
were out of sight down the mountain side.The first work of our friends after they had made certain that the
Africans had really retreated, was to attend to Tom's wound and
the bruise Randolph Rover had received from the stone.Fortunately
neither man nor boy was seriously hurt, although Tom carries the
mark of the spear's thrust to this day."But I don't care," said Tom."I hit old King Susko, and that was
worth a good deal, for it stopped the battle.If the fight had
kept on there is no telling how many of us might have been
killed."While the party was deliberating about what to do next, Cujo
reappeared."I go deep into de cabe when foah Bumwos come on me from behind,"
he explained."Da fight an' fight an' knock me down an' tie me wid vines, an'
den run away.But I broke loose from de vines an' cum just as
quick as could run.Werry big cabe dat, an' strange waterfall in
de back.""Let us explore the cave," said Dick."Somebody can remain on
guard outside."Some demurred to this, but the Rover boys could, not be held back,
and on they went, with Aleck with them.Soon Randolph Rover
hobbled after them, leaving Cujo and the college students to
remain on the watch.The cave proved to be a large affair, running all of half a mile
under the mountain.There were numerous holes in the roof,
through which the sun shone down, making the use of torches
unnecessary.To one side was a deep and swiftly flowing stream,
coming from the waterfall Cujo had mentioned, and disappearing
under the rocks near the entrance to the cavern.shouted Dick, as he gazed on the walls of the
cave."You are, Dick; this is a regular cave of gold, and no mistake.No wonder King Susko wanted to keep us away!"It was a fascinating scene to
watch the sparkling sheet as it thundered downward a distance of
fully a hundred feet.At the bottom was a pool where the water
was lashed into a milky foam which went swirling round and round.suddenly cried Sam, and pointed into
the falling water."Oh, Uncle Randolph, did you ever see anything
like it?""There are no such things as ghosts, Sam," replied his uncle."Stand here and look," answered Sam, and his uncle did as
requested.Presently from out of the mist came the form of a man--the
likeness of Randolph Rover himself!"It is nothing but an optical illusion, Sam, such as are produced
by some magicians on the theater stage.The sun comes down
through yonder hole and reflects your image on the wet rock, which
in turn reflects the form on the sheet of water."And that must be the ghost the natives believe in,"
answered Sam.I can tell you I was
startled.""Here is a path leading up past the waterfall," said Dick, who had
been making an investigation."Take care of where you go," warned Randolph Rover."There may be
some nasty pitfall there.""I'll keep my eyes open," responded Dick.He ascended the rocks, followed by Sam, while the others brought
up in the rear.Up over the waterfall was another cave, long and
narrow.There was now but little light from overhead, but far in
the distance could be seen a long, narrow opening, as if the
mountain top had been, by some convulsion of nature, split in
half."We are coming into the outer world again!"For beyond the opening was a small plain, covered with short grass
and surrounded on every side by jagged rocks which arose to the
height of fifty or sixty feet.In the center of the plain were a
number of native huts, of logs thatched with palm.CHAPTER XXX

FINDING THE LONG-LOST


"A village!""There are several women and children," returned Tom, pointing to
one of the huts."I guess the men went away to fight us."Let us investigate, but with
caution."As they advanced, the women and children set up a cry of alarm,
which was quickly taken up in several of the other huts."Go away, white men; don't touch us!"cried a voice in the purest
English.came from the three Rover boys, and they rushed off in
all haste toward the nut from which the welcome cry had proceeded.Anderson Rover was found in the center of the hut, bound fast by a
heavy iron chain to a post set deeply into the ground.His face
was haggard and thin and his beard was all of a foot and a half
long, while his hair fell thickly over his shoulders.He was
dressed in the merest rags, and had evidently suffered much from
starvation and from other cruel treatment."Do I see aright, or
is it only another of those wild dreams that have entered my brain
lately?"burst out Dick, and hugged his parent
around the neck."It's no dream, father; we are really here," put in Tom, as he
caught one of the slender hands, while Sam caught the other.And then he added tenderly: "But
we'll take good care of you, now we have found you."murmured Anderson Rover, as the brother came up.and the tears began to
flow down his cheeks.Many a time I
thought to give up in despair!""We came as soon as we got that message you sent," answered Dick."But that was long after you had sent it.""And is the sailor, Converse, safe?""Too bad--he was the one friend I had here.""And King Susko has kept you a prisoner all this while?""Yes; and he has treated me shamefully in the bargain.He
imagined I knew all of the secrets of this mountain, of a gold
mine of great riches, and he would not let me go; but, instead,
tried to wring the supposed secret from me by torture.""We will settle accounts with him some day," muttered Dick."It's
a pity Tom didn't kill him."The native women and children were looking in at the doorway
curiously, not knowing what to say or do.Turning swiftly, Dick
caught one by the arm."The key to the lock," he demanded, pointing to the lock on the
iron chain which bound Anderson Rover.But the woman shook her head, and pointed off in the distance."King Susko has the key," explained Anderson Rover."You will
have to break the chain,"  And this was at last done, although not
without great difficulty.In the meantime the natives were ordered to prepare a meal for
Anderson Rover and all of the others, and Cujo was called that he
might question the Africans in their own language.The meal was soon forthcoming, the Bumwo women fearing that they
would be slaughtered if they did not comply with the demands of
the whites.To make sure that the food had not been poisoned,
Dick made several of the natives eat portions of each dish."Um know a good deal," he remarked."Cujo was goin' to tell Dick to do dat.""I am glad the women and children are here," said Randolph Rover."We can take them with us when we leave and warn King Susko that
if he attacks us we will kill them.I think he will rather let us
go than see all of the women and children slaughtered."While they ate, Anderson Rover told his story, which is far too
long to insert here.He had found a gold mine further up the
country and also this mountain of gold, but had been unable to do
anything since King Susko had made him and the sailor prisoners.During his captivity he had suffered untold cruelties, but all
this was now forgotten in the joy of the reunion with his brother
and his three sons.It was decided that the party should leave the mountain without
delay, and Cujo told the female natives to get ready to move.At
this they set up a loud protest, but it availed them nothing, and
they soon quieted down when assured that no harm would befall them
if they behaved.CHAPTER XXXI

HOME AGAIN--CONCLUSION


Nightfall found the entire expedition, including the women and
children, on the mountain side below the caves.As the party went
down the mountain a strict watch was kept for the Bumwo warriors,
and just as the sun was setting, they were discovered in camp on
the trail to the northwest."We will send out a flag of truce," said Randolph Rover.This was done, and presently a tall Bumwo under chief came out in
a plain to hold a mujobo, or "law talk."In a few words Cujo explained the situation, stating that they now
held in bondage eighteen women and children, including King
Susko's favorite wife Afgona.If the whites were allowed to pass
through the country unharmed until they, reached the village of
Kwa, where the Kassai River joins the Congo, they would release
all of the women and children at that point and they could go back
to rejoin their husbands and fathers.If, on the other hand, the
expedition was attacked the whites would put all of those in
bondage to instant death.It is not likely that this horrible threat would have been put
into execution.As Dick said when relating the particulars of the
affair afterward."We couldn't have done such a terrible thing,
for it would not have been human."But the threat had the desired
effect, and in the morning King Susko, who was now on a sick bed,
sent word that they should go through unmolested.And go through they did, through jungles and over plains, across
rivers and lakes and treacherous swamps, watching continually for
their enemies, and bringing down many a savage beast that showed
itself.On the return they fell in with Mortimer Blaze, and he,
being a crack shot, added much to the strength of their command.At last Kwa was reached, and here they found themselves under the
protection of several European military organizations.The native
women and children were released, much to their joy, and my
readers can rest assured that these Africans lost no time in
getting back to that portion of the Dark Continent which they
called home.From Kwa to Boma the journey was comparatively easy.At Stanley
Pool they rested for a week, and all in the party felt the better
for it."Some day I will go back and open up the mines I have discovered,"
said Anderson Rover.I want to see my own dear
native land first."Josiah Crabtree had turned up and been
joined by Dan Baxter, and both had left for parts unknown."I hope we never see them again," said Dick, and his brothers said
the same.An American ship was in port, bound for Baltimore, and all of our
party, including the Yale students, succeeded in obtaining passage
on her for home.The trip was a most delightful one, and no days
could have been happier than those which the Rover boys spent
grouped around their lather listening to all he had to tell of the
numerous adventures which had befallen him since he had left home.A long letter was written to Captain Townsend, telling of the
finding of Anderson Rover, and the master of the Rosabel was,
later on, sent a gift of one hundred dollars for his goodness to
the Rovers.Of course Anderson Rover was greatly interested in what his sons
had been doing and was glad to learn that they were progressing so
finely at Putnam Hall."We will let Arnold Baxter drop," he said."He is our enemy, I know; but just now we will let the law take
its course for the rascality he practiced in Albany.""We can afford to let him
drop, seeing how well things have terminated for ourselves.""And how happy we are going to be," chimed in Sam."And how rich--when father settles up that mining claim in the
West," put in Tom.Here I must bring to a finish the story of the Rover boys'
adventures in the jungles of Africa.They had started out to find
their father, and they had found him, and for the time being all
went well.The home-coming of the Rovers was the occasion of a regular
celebration at Valley Brook farm.The neighbors came in from far
and wide and with them several people from the city who in former
years had known Anderson Rover well.It was a time never to be forgotten, and the celebration was kept
up for several days.Captain Putnam was there, and with him came
Frank, Fred, Larry, and several others.The captain apologized
handsomely to Aleck for the way he had treated the <DW52> man."I wish I had been with you," said Fred."You Rover boys are
wonders for getting around."I think we'll go West next," answered Dick."Father wants to
look up his mining interests, you know.We are going to ask him
to take us along."They did go west, and what adventures they had
will be related in a new volume, entitled "The Rover Boys Out West;
or, The Search for a Lost Mine.""But we are coming back to Putnam Hall first," added Tom.I thought of it even in the heart of Africa!""And so did I," put in Sam."I'll tell you, fellows, it's good
enough to roam around, but, after all, there is no place like
home."And with this truthful remark from the youngest Rover, let us
close this volume, kind reader, hoping that all of us may meet
again in the next book of the series, to be entitled, "The Rover
Boys Out West; or, The Search for a Lost Mine."In this story all
of our friends will once more play important parts, and we will
learn what the Baxters, father and son, did toward wresting the
Rover Boys' valuable mining property from them.But for the time
being all went well, and so good-by."Come," she said
abruptly, "get out of those rags and into something modern."She
opened a closet door and selected a gown from a number hanging there.It was white, and there was a gay ribbon at the waist."It'll have to be pinned up," she commented to herself, holding it out
before her and regarding Carmen critically.she exclaimed, "am I to wear that?The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau drawer and took from
it several other garments, which she threw upon a chair, together with
the dress."Into the whole lot of 'em," she said sharply, indicating the
garments."And move lively, for supper's waitin' and there'll be
callers soon--gentlemen callers," she added, smiling grimly.The woman stopped
abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding the girl.Carmen gazed
up at her with a smile of happy, trustful assurance.She mentioned Simiti, Padre Jose, and Rosendo.Her
voice quavered a little; but she brightened up and concluded: "And Mr.Reed's Auntie, she met us--that is, me.Oh, isn't she a beautiful
lady!"The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child's gaze.Then, suddenly,
as if something had given way under great strain, she cried: "For
God's sake, don't look at me that way!She dropped into
a chair and continued to stare at the girl."Well, I've told you," replied Carmen."But," she continued, going
quickly to the woman and taking her hand, "you haven't told me your
name yet.And we are going to be such good friends, aren't we?And you are going to tell me all about this beautiful house, and
that wonderful carriage I came here in.Reed will take me out in it every
day!"Then, in a low voice:

"Your mother--is she living?""But my mother, my own real mother,
she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the great river.My father
left her, and she was trying to follow him.Then I was born--"

"The same old story!""I've been there,
girl, and know all about it.I followed the man--but it was my kid
that died!God, if I could have laid my hands on him!And now you have
come here--"

She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard.Carmen gently stole an arm
about her neck."It isn't true," she murmured, laying her soft cheek
against the woman's painted one."No one can desert us or harm us, for
_God is everywhere_.Padre Jose said I had a message for the people up here; and now you
are the first one I've told it to.And if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us.But you
didn't know it when your husband left you, did you?"Then she looked up into the girl's
deep, wondering eyes and checked herself."Come," she said abruptly,
rising and still holding her hand."We'll go down to supper now as you
are."Carmen's companion led her down the stairs and through the hall to a
brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half
dozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were
unoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver
sparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in
gowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to
the one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had
met her at the boat.The silence and the steady
scrutiny of the others began to embarrass her."Where--where is
Auntie?"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly
in her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down
in confusion.asked one of the younger women of Carmen's
attendant.Headache," was the laconic reply."She landed a queen this time, didn't she?"looking admiringly at
Carmen."Gets me, how the old girl does it!"Carmen," replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly about the
room."Carmen Ariza," the child amended, as her big, wondering eyes swept
the group."Where do you hail from,
angel-face?"The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor."Tell them where you lived, child," said the woman called Jude in a
low voice."Simiti," replied Carmen, tears choking her words.A
burst of mirth punctuated the question."Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions."Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, "South America."Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table, while the women
sat regarding the girl curiously."But," continued Carmen in a trembling voice, "where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore
such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and helplessness as
to throw a hush upon the room.she
muttered, "it's a shame!"She looked for a moment uncertainly into the
big, deep eyes of the girl, and then turned and hastily left the
room.The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted creature at
the end of the table."What an old devil the Madam is!One look into those eyes
would have been enough for me!""This is only a recruiting
station for the regular army.She'll go over to French Lucy's; and the
Madam will get a round price for the job.""Old Lucy'll get rich off of her!Ames owns
her house, too, doesn't he?"replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus of her
wine."He owns every house in this block, they say.The Madam rolls on the
floor and cusses for a week straight every time she pays hers.But
just the same, if you've ever noticed, the houses that Ames owns are
never raided by the coppers.Ames whacks up with the mayor and the
city hall gang and the chief of police.That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents.But it's a lot better'n being swooped down
on by the cops every few weeks, ain't it?We know what we're expected
to pay, that way.And we never do when we keep handin' it out to the
cops."And he's got a new
collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.They're the old
man's agents now for his dive-houses.He can't get anybody else to
handle 'em, so the collector tells me.""Belle Carey's place was pulled last night, I hear," said one of the
women, pushing back her plate and lighting a cigarette."Yes," returned Jude, "and why?Cause the house is owned by
Gannette--swell guy livin' up on Riverside Drive--and he don't divvy
with the city hall.Belle don't pay no such rent as the Madam does--at
least so old Lucy tells me."The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred their
laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.Caught a pippin for her once--right off
the train--jus' like this li'l hussy.Went to th' depot in a hack.Saw
th' li'l kid comin' an' pretended to faint.Li'l kid run to me an'
asked could she help.Got her to see me safe home--tee!She's
workin' f'r ol' Lucy yet, sound's a dollar."She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back into her former
state of sodden stupidity.The policeman's words at the
pier were floating confusedly through her thought.The strange talk of
these women increased the confusion.Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table."I haven't
the nerve for another sob-scene," she commented as she went out.pleaded Carmen, turning from one to
another.Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly.Then, to Carmen:

"You are in a--a hotel," she said abruptly."Oh--then--then it was a mistake?"The girl turned her great, yearning
eyes upon the woman."Sit down, and finish
your supper," she said harshly, pulling the girl toward the chair.The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly.The <DW64> waitress
went quickly out and closed the door.Jude rose, still holding the
girl's hand."Come up stairs with me," she said, leading her away.commented one of the women, when the two had left the
room.But she's housekeeper, and that's part of her job.Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.Then she
sank wearily into a chair.she cried, "I'm sick of this--sick
of the whole thing!"It was all a
mistake, and we can go.""Why, you said this was a hotel--"

"Hotel!Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression on her
face."Now listen," said Jude, bracing herself, "I've got something to tell
you.For God's sake, child,
don't look at me that way!"Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.But if you did,
and if you believe in a God, you had better pray to Him now!"I was afraid--a
little--at first.When we stop and just know that we love
everybody, and that everybody really loves us, why, we can't be afraid
any more, can we?"The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.That
warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to her.And God--it was only
a convenient execrative.But--what was it that looked out from that
strange girl's eyes?What
was emerging from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?Whence came
that beautiful, white life that she was going to blast?"Look here," she cried sharply, "tell me again all about yourself, and
about your friends and family down south, and what it was that the
Madam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the
story.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and
then a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to
stray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she
herself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New
England farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,
trudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over
her little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as
the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible
dream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag
down to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might
thereafter fall!"And I have just had to know," Carmen concluded, "every minute since I
left Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any
harm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_
opens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught."The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness
upon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she
knelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to
bless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged
to her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent
though she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening."It's the boys from
the college!"She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to
formulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,
which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress."Now," she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained
voice, "you do just as I say.And for God's sake
don't speak!"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and
locked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped
softly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl
had first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of
glasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near
them opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen
into a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to
another door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a
window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a
padlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl
precede her cautiously."It's a fire-escape," she explained briefly.She reached through the
window grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and
quickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept
swiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped
to throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the
bureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they
emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,
and the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,
felt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street
brought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high
board fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,
over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen read, "The
Little Sisters of the Poor."A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister
Superior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they
were silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,
similarly dressed, awaited them."Sister," said Jude excitedly, "here's a little kid--you got to care
for her until she finds her friends!"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman."Let
the child wait here a moment," she said, "and you come with me and
tell your story.It would be better that she should not hear."Carmen was drowsing in her
chair."She's chock full of religion," the woman was saying."But you," the Sister replied, "what will you do?"Then you will stay here until--"

"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I
couldn't stay here--with her," nodding toward the girl."But--you will
take care of her?""Surely," returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night."Come," said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2


Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its
shrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes
she gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel
the tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the
call to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of
Harris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of
memories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was
alone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and
for a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and
drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and
placed there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell
open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles.""That means me," she said
firmly."Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I
am to tell it to these people up here.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little
lad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the
bed."I must think only God's thoughts,"
she said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief."If it is
right for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is
not right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I
must not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts."She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes."I simply
can not wear these things," she mourned, looking at them dubiously;
"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other
woman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And
why was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter
there, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold."She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress."But," she continued, "I have got to go
out now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find
them--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in
the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's
little locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in
Simiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some
moments."I haven't any father or mother but God," she murmured."But
He is both father and mother to me now."With a little sigh she tied
up the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much
despised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped
abruptly."I have been
thinking only of myself.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way
that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.'And Padre Jose said he would
remember it, too."Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of
the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,
murmuring at every step, "God is everywhere--right here!"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a
number of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered
curiously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates
when they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing
uncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in
the other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for
her in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her
into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at
breakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated
at the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive
wonder."Well," began the Sister at length, "eat your breakfast quickly.This
is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an
hour.But you are with friends
here, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted
flexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once
upon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,
the subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded
with the cryptical remark: "And, you know, Senora, it is all just as
Padre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being
was this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts
on the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,
the Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--"She's
chock full of religion."But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering
the child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, "The Virgin be
praised!""Oh," said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, "you
people up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you
didn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many
more ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy
words in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the
last years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about
God in that language than in any other."And who is this
Jose that you talk so much about?""He--taught me--in Simiti."Well," replied the Sister warmly, "he seems to have taught you queer
things!"returned Carmen quickly, "he just taught me the truth.He
didn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they
were not real."Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's
thought had strayed to other topics.she
exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her."I guess I'll
have to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.""Didn't you
wear shoes in your country?""No," replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; "I didn't
wear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,
Senora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!"She sighed, and her eyes
filled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at
the Sister."I've come here because it is right," she said with a firm
nod of her head."Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you
didn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything
else!"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she
went on briskly:

"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he
had to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,
he will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will
he?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't
so, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora," she exclaimed,
suddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, "is this a
church?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--"

"No," replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while
her manner became more severe; "this is a home for old people, a
charitable institution.""Oh," replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant."Well," her face alight and her eyes dancing, "I don't belong here
then, do I?I am never going to be old," she meditated.The Bible says we
are made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we
ever grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane
and saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong
way of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be
like Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is
true--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we
have all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there
will not be any places like this for old people--people who still
believe that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on."Padre Jose
sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and
he always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was
right, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus
did not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of
the bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,
first said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,
I've had thousands of proofs!"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,
continued:

"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is
to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;
and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in
power apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and
that is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and
you can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation."Oh, Senora," cried the enthusiastic girl, "the things that Jesus
taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in
mathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be
demonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only
in heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say
so often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we
will be in heaven.But," she went on after catching
her breath, "we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be
real and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--"

"I've heard that before," interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat
from her surprise."But I think that before you get out of New York
you will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,
and it is quite real, we find.""If it is real, then God made it.It
seems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in
your consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.""Well," said the woman dryly, "on that basis I think the same may be
said of good, too.""No," answered Carmen eagerly, "good is--"

"There," interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,
"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which
that fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and
one that she would not accept."Senora," she began again, after a brief interval, "Padre Jose is a
good man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his
problem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other
people think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always
tried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you
are not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that," she
said softly, "is nothing."She was beginning to feel the spell of
those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling
expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from
those red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the
girl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign
attire could not disguise."Senora," said Carmen suddenly, "the people on the boat laughed at my
clothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black
bonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I
was brought here."It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman
instantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of
severe dignity."And
remember after this that children's manners here are not those of your
country."The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer
room, and presently a priest looked in."Good morning, Sister," he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the
twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a
round, shining face that radiated health and good nature."It is a little
waif," she said in answer to his query, "who strayed in here last
night.""Aha," said the priest, "another derelict!And will you send her to
the orphanage?""I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other
children," replied the Sister."Father," she continued seriously, "I
want you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should
be done with her.""No," replied the Sister; "but another priest has gone wrong, and
this," pointing to Carmen, "is the result of his pernicious
teachings.""Very well, Sister," he said in a low voice."I will talk with her
after the service."He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,
as he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to
the institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the
chapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose
celebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such
elaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the
responses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,
even if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She
thought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and
embarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people
attracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And
never, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and
helplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there
for, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did
they believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine
into flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about
the people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,
had prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for
the old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest
descended from the pulpit and came to Carmen."Now, little girl," he
said, seating himself beside her, "tell me all about yourself, who you
are, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into
her narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the
priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation."But," she heard the priest say, "you tell me that this
Father Jose taught you these things?""He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the
world," the girl replied."Yes, yes," the priest went on hurriedly; "but these other things,
these religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, "God."He reached out and laid a hand
on hers."I believe you," he said, in a voice scarcely audible."I
believe you--for we do not teach such things.""Then," she said quizzically,
"you are not really a priest."The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet
chapel."The dinner-bell
will ring in a few minutes," continued the Sister, regarding the man
severely."Ah, true," he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock."The time
passed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--"

"Leave the girl to me," replied the Sister coldly."Unless," she
added, "you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country
suddenly into this cold climate might--"

"No, no," interrupted the priest hastily; "she seems uncommonly strong
mentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from
ours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her."He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her
head stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he
turned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall
and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below."Katherine," said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, "put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in
your room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out
of her head."CHAPTER 3


"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir
bairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air
to yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister
Superior.But, mind your tongue,
honey.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as
the soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.""But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?"There was a
note of appeal in the quavering voice."Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the
truth, God bless ye, honey!"They don't, Sen--Sister!""Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid
ye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air
a right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'
kitchen.""Sen--I mean, Sister--"

"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.""Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr."No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a
bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for
th' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow."It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently
followed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of
stairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her
that her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental
accumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the
kitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,
annunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which
the human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her
fascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not
wholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose
mountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her
with open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times
during the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her
assumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon
the brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,
the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in
a love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and
sincere."Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds," said the
woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out
over the kindling lights of the city."Not much, I guess, honey," answered the woman frankly."Troth, an'
I've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,
an' she landed me in a convint!"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--"

"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle
on me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer
th' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin
tell, honey."But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!"pleaded the girl, going to the
woman and twining her arms about her neck."Och, honey darlin'"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and
rolled down her wrinkled cheeks--"honey darlin', call me Katie, just
old Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a
beautiful daughter like you--!"She clasped the girl in her great arms
and held her tightly."Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given
you what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from
seeing it.""An' so, darlin', if I want
diamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft
cheek against the leathery visage of the old woman."Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's
nivir been said to old Katie!""Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved
me--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir
land a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become
a bride o' th' Church."But, Katie, the face is nothing.Why, your heart is as big--as big as
the whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that."Och, darlin'," murmured the woman, "sure th' Virgin be praised fer
sendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!""It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here," said the
girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek."It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.""Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,
an' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be
good to His children.He is
infinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what
awful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of
the great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there
wouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole
world!Katie," after a little pause, "I know."Air these more o' yer funny
notions, darlin'?""I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie," answered the
girl.But then,
th' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church
don't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm
thinkin', does Father Waite.""Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?""He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught
me what I know."Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny
notions?""No, Katie, he said they were right."Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a
good man--troth, they make no better in this world!"Carmen looked out wonderingly over
the city.She yearned to know what it held for her."Katie," she said at length, bending again over the woman, "will you
help me find Mr."Och, lassie--what's your name again?""Carmen," replied the girl, "Carmen Ariza.""Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey; an' we're both a long
way from th' ol' sod!Lassie dear, tell me about last night.But, no;
begin 'way back.Old Katie's weak in th' head,
girlie, but she may see a way out fer ye.Th' Virgin help ye, puir
bairn!"Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower when Carmen
finished her story.exclaimed the old Sister, staring at the girl
in amazement."Now do ye let me feel of ye to see that ye air human;
fer only a Saint could go through all that an' live to tell it!An'
the place ye were in last night!Now be Saint Patrick, if I was rich
I'd have Masses said every day fer that Jude who brung ye here!Don't
tell me th' good Lord won't forgive her!"She's a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry for her, but I
don't know why.She has a beautiful home in that hotel--"

"Hotel, is it!But--och, sure, it was a hotel, honey.Only, ye air better off here wi' old Katie."But--unless it's wi' Father
Waite, I don't know what I can do.Ye air in bad with th' Sister
Superior fer yer talk at th' breakfast table.Ye're a fresh little
heathen, honey.An' she's suspicious of Father Waite, too.An' he th' best man on airth!But his doctrine ain't just sound,
sweatheart.There,
honey, lave it to me.But it's got to be done quick, or th' Sister
Superior'll have ye in an orphan asylum, where ye'll stay till ye air
soused in th' doctrine!I can manage to get word to Father Waite
to-morrow, airly.A bit of a word wi'
him'll fix it, lassie dear.An' now, honey swate, off with them funny
clothes and plump into bed.it's all but marnin' now!"A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay so quiet at
her side."Honey," she whispered, "was ye tellin' me awhile back that ye knew
the right way to pray?""Yes, Katie dear," the child murmured."Thin do you pray, lass, an' I'll not trouble the Virgin this night."*       *       *       *       *

"Well, Father, what do you think now?"The Sister Superior looked up
aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the room.His head was
bowed, and there was a look of deep earnestness upon his face."I have talked with her again--an hour, or more," he said reflectively."She is a--a remarkable girl, in many ways.""She attracts and repels me, both," she
said.And she appears to be
suffering from religious dementia.It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his words
carefully before replying."She does--seem to--to have rather--a--rather
unusual--religious views," said he slowly."Would it not be well to have Dr."That we may know what to do with her.If she is mentally unsound she
must not be sent to the orphanage.""She should be taken--a--I mean, we should try to locate her friends.I have already searched the city directory; but, though there are many
Reeds, there are none listed with the initials she gave me as his.I
had thought," he continued hesitatingly, "I had thought of putting her
in charge of the Young Women's Christian Association--"

"Father Waite!"The Sister Superior rose and drew herself up to her
full height."Do you mean to say that you have contemplated delivering
her into the hands of heretics?"she demanded coldly, her tall figure
instinct with the mortal pride of religious superiority."Why, Sister," returned the priest with embarrassment, "would it not
be wise to place her among those whose views harmonize more closely
with hers than ours do?"urged the man, with a gesture of
impatience.The combined weight of all the
centuries of church authority could not make her one--never!I must
take her to those with whom she rightfully belongs."The Sister Superior's eyes narrowed and glittered, and her face grew
dark.I am in charge here, and I
shall report this case to the Bishop!"The futility of his case
seemed to impress him.Taking up his hat, he bowed without speaking
and went out.Outside
the door the man listened until he caught the number she called.His
face grew dark and angry, and his hands clenched a she strode down the
hall.On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister Katherine."Wait on th' corner--behind the church!The lassie will meet you
there!"Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into the dark
stairway.Stopping at a small closet below, she took out a bundle.Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned Carmen, who was sitting
at a table peeling potatoes."Troth, lazy lass," she commanded sharply, "do you take the bucket and
mop and begin on the front steps.And mind that ye don't bring me
heavy hand down on ye!Och, lassie darlin'," she added, when she had
drawn the startled girl out of hearing of the others, "give yer old
Katie a kiss, and then be off!Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye
go--but 'twould break yours to stay!Go, lassie darlin', an' don't
fergit old Katie!Here," thrusting the girl's bundle and a dollar bill
into her hands, "an' God bless ye, lass!Ye've won me, heart an' soul!Ye'll find a frind at th' nixt corner!"She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it all.She
looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building from which she had
been ejected.Then, grasping her
bundle and the dollar bill, she hurried out through the gate and
started up the street.The man's face was furrowed, and
his body trembled.The girl went up to him with a glad smile.The
priest looked up, and muttered something incoherent under his breath a
she took her hand.He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an approaching
street car."To police headquarters," he replied, "to ask them to help us find
your friends."CHAPTER 4


From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the ocean, the fog was
again creeping stealthily across the bay and into the throbbing
arteries of the great city.Through half-opened doors and windows it
rolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains
of brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it
swirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the
windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the
chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy
rooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting
external expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into
the chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,
thin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets
of his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,
until it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like
visage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment
of utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed
it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties
of the Molino Company--the "near-mines" in the rocky canon of the
far-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian
review, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were
advertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,
trusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its
inception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass
Ketchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and
Philip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those
sturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly
severed the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the
allurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove
him, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled
for many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless
efforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less
constricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it
several times.He aspired to the hand of a
sister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the
best colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their
honeymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press
noticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from
the field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the
Ketchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,
and then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman
hurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only
to find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and
questionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he
immediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of
parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has
battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial
enterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as
is possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with
diligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly
different means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready
wit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could
think of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed
champion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,
mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in
the minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his
cups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was
petulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall.As the women approached the door of the chapel through which came
Carmen's low singing they turned and looked at each other inquiringly.Then they quietly entered the doorway and stood listening.Carmen,
concealed behind the organ, did not see them.Hawley-Crowles went quickly to the organ.Bending over it, she gazed down into the face of the startled girl."Get up and let me see what sort of a
looking creature you are."Reed came forward and gave her a tempered
greeting.Hawley-Crowles fell back and stared at the girl
from head to foot."You know," she said to her sister, "this is the
first glimpse I've had of your husband's discovery.I was out of the
city when he brought her to my house, you remember.But," turning
again to Carmen, "sing that song over, dear, please--the one you were
singing just now."Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles drew
her sister to the rear of the room."It will sound better back here,"
she explained.After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs."Belle," she
said, nodding her head sententiously, "you had a pearl, and you threw
it away.Her voice, and her
face--why, with our ward--this beautiful, gifted, South American owner
of a famous mine--as a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the
Ames to our terms!Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor Jurges in the
office below had reached a conclusion."A young lady of--ah--invincible
will," the doctor had observed; "and already--ah--decidedly mature,
despite her tender years.Should she--ah--assume leadership over the
pupils of your school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be
disquieting.There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said.But, what astonishes me is--ah--that this strange cult
should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical America!The girl is utterly--ah--unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing her from the school can not be
questioned."By all means," asserted the latter gentleman with great seriousness,
while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin's written order for a
hundred shares of Simiti stock which he held in his hand."Very well, then," said the lady with a determined nod of her head; "I
shall request Mrs.Then, with a proper sense
of what it meant to have the moral support of such an eminent divine
as Doctor Jurges, she rang for her maid and bade her summon Mrs.Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the checkerboard
of life, and slept that night once more under the spacious roof of the
wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles, on Riverside Drive.CHAPTER 7


As has been said, Carmen's six months in the Elwin school had been a
period of slow adjustment to the changed order.She had brought into
this new world a charm of unsophistication, an ingenuous _naivete_,
such as only an untrammeled spirit nourished in an elemental
civilization like that of primitive Simiti could develop.Added to
this was the zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had
come as a message-bearer to a people with a great need.Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in the great
States were not so different, after all, from those of her own
unprogressive country.Her next was one of sad disillusionment, as the
fact slowly dawned upon her trusting thought that the busy denizens of
her new environment took no interest whatsoever in her message.And
then her joy and brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to
find her strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation.She had come utterly free of dogma or creed, and
happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious caste.Her
Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of the Master's
words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered in the warm
atmosphere of love for mankind.Her concept of the Christ stirred no
thought within her of intolerance toward those who might hold
differing views; nor did it raise interposing barriers within her own
mind, nor evoke those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the
souls of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing, saw the advent of
that day when all mankind would obey the commands of Jesus, and do the
works which he did, even to the complete spiritualization and
dematerializing of all human thought.And her burning desire was to
hasten the coming of that glad hour.The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity was
steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity and
progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her slowly.And
with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of the fine edge of her
enthusiasm.She grew quiet as the days passed, and drew away from her
companions into her thought.With her increasing sense of isolation
came at length a great longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and
return to her native environment and the sympathy and tender
solicitude of her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jose.Indeed, she could not be certain now of their
whereabouts.A great war was raging in Colombia, and she knew not what
fate had befallen her loved ones.To her many letters directed to
Simiti there had come back no reply.Even Harris, who had written
again and again to both Rosendo and Jose, had received no word from
them in return.Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing
and heart-sickness seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned squarely upon the
foul brood of evil suggestions crowding upon her and, as if they were
fell spirits from the nether world, bade them begone."I know you for what you are--_nothing_!You seemed to
use Padre Jose, but you can't use me!He is my life; and you, evil thoughts, can't make me think He isn't!I
am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will _not_ witness
to His opposite, evil!My life is filled with harmony; and you, evil
thoughts, can't reverse that fact!God has brought me here, else I
would not have come, for He is the cause of all that is.It is for me
to stand and see His glory.as she paced about the room and
seemed to ward off the assaults of an invisible enemy, "there is no
power apart from Him!Then, in the lull of battle, "Father divine, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard me.And now I lay my all upon the altar of love, and throw
myself upon Thy thought."From that day, despite continued attacks from error--despite, too, the
veiled slights and covert insinuations of her schoolmates, to whom the
girl's odd views and utter refusal to share their accustomed
conversation, their interest in mundane affairs, their social
aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length made her quite
unwelcome--Carmen steadily, and without heed of diverting gesture,
brought into captivity every thought to the obedience of her
Christ-principle, and threw off for all time the dark cloud of
pessimism which human belief and the mesmerism of events had drawn
over her joyous spirit.Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in the school;
but Ketchim had visited her often--not, however, alone, but always
with one or more prospective purchasers of Simiti stock in tow whom
he sought to influence favorably through Carmen's interesting
conversation about her native land.Harris came every Sunday, and
the girl welcomed the great, blundering fellow as the coming of the
day.At times he would obtain Madam Elwin's permission to take the
girl up to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he
would abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her naive wonder
and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated by it.He
was the only one now with whom she felt any degree of freedom, and
in his presence her restraint vanished and her airy gaiety again
welled forth with all its wonted fervor.Once, shortly after Carmen
had been enrolled, Harris took her to a concert by the New York
Symphony Orchestra.But in the midst of the program, after sitting
in silent rapture, the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be
taken out.she sobbed as, outside the door,
she hid her tear-stained face in his coat; "I just couldn't!Oh, it was God that we heard--it was God!"And the
astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up emotion
as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came a rapid
expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and the young lady who
left the Elwin school that bright spring afternoon under the
protection of the self-sufficient Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was very far
from being the inquisitive, unabashed little girl who had so
greatly shocked the good Sister Superior by her heretical views
some six months before.The sophistication engendered by her
intercourse with the pupils and instructors in the school had
transformed the eager, trusting little maid, who could see only good
into a mature woman, who, though her trust remained unshaken,
nevertheless had a better understanding of the seeming power "that
lusteth against the spirit," and whose idea of her mission had been
deepened into a grave sense of responsibility.She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality in
the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power over
those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality had as
yet scarcely penetrated.Her thought had begun to shape a definite
purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer, but the message must be
set forth in her life conduct.The futility of promiscuous verbal
delivery of the message to whomsoever might cross her path had
been made patent.She must do
likewise, and let her deeds attest the truth of her words.And from
the day that she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her,
she had consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the
Master's life and words, if happily she might acquire "that mind"
which he so wondrously expressed.But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration was by no
means sudden.There were times when she could not restrain the impulse
to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively set forth by the preachers
and lecturers whom Madam Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who,
unlike Jesus, first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life
beyond the grave.Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst of an
eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian divine
of considerable repute, and asked him why it was that, as he seemed to
set forth, God had changed His mind after creating spiritual man, and
had created a man of dust.She had later repented her scandalous
conduct in sackcloth and ashes; but it did not prevent her from
abruptly leaving the chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another
divine, this time a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his
theories of endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at
length upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are
God-sent for mankind's chastisement and discipline.Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions and
beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise superior to them.But her experience with the preachers wrought within her a strong
determination henceforth to listen to no religious propaganda
whatsoever, to give no further heed to current theological beliefs,
and to enter no church edifice, regardless of the tenets of the sect
worshiping within its precincts.The wisdom of this decision she left
for the future to determine."Oh," she cried, "my only mission is to manifest the divine, not to
waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers, who fail
utterly to prove the truth of their teachings!Oh, how the world needs
love--just love!And I am going to love it with the selfless love that
comes from God, and destroys error and the false beliefs that become
externalized in the human consciousness as sickness, failure, old
age, and death!Love, love, love--it is mankind's greatest need!Why,
if the preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity is
love!It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom of all
sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the one Father
of Christ Jesus!Oh, God--take me
out into the world, and let me show it what love can do!"And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple of the
Christ--aye, had heard it long before the solicitous, fluttering
little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl's unevangelical views
were inimical to the best interests of her very select school.Hawley-Crowles threw wide the
portals of the world to Carmen, and she entered, wide-eyed and
wondering.Nor did she return until the deepest recesses of the human
mind had revealed to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly
emptiness of reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive than her sister, had
seized upon Carmen with avidity bred of hope long deferred.The
scourge of years of fruitless social striving had rendered her
desperate, and she would have staged a ballet on her dining table,
with her own ample self as _premiere danseuse_, did the attraction but
promise recognition from the blase members of fashionable New York's
ultra-conservative set.From childhood she had looked eagerly forward
through the years with an eye single to such recognition as life's
desideratum.To this end she had bartered both youth and beauty with
calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles money bags; only to weep
floods of angry tears when the bargain left her social status
unchanged, and herself tied to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished
name wholly neutralized the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold.Fortunately for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she had
long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon the stricken
widow had him carefully incinerated and his ashes tenderly deposited
in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which her architect had taken oath cost
more than the showy Ames vault by many thousands.The period of
decorous mourning past, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds
and threw herself again into the terrific competition for social
standing, determined this time that it should be a warfare to the
death.And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr.Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest.She complied, and had returned with restored health
and determination just as her sister came up from South America,
bringing the odd little "savage" whom Reed had discovered in the wilds
of Guamoco.A prolonged week-end at Newport, the last of the summer
season, accounted for her absence from the city when Reed brought
Carmen to her house, where he and his wife were making their temporary
abode.Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the
Elwin school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she seemed
to see a light."It does look like a desperate chance, I admit," she said, when
recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later."But I've played
every other card in my hand; and now this girl is going to be either a
trump or a joker.All we need is a word from the Beaubien, and the
following week will see an invitation at our door from Mrs.The trick is to reach the Beaubien.And I'm going to introduce the girl as an Inca
princess.Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto she had
lacked the one essential to social success, money.In addition, she
had committed the egregious blunder of marrying for love.And now that
the honeymoon had become a memory, and she faced again her growing
ambition, with a struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to
aid her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand a year,
which she had inherited from her mother, only an aggravation.True, in
time her wandering father would pass away; and there was no doubt that
his vast property would fall to his daughters, his only living kin.But at present, in view of his aggressively good health and disregard
for his relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into the
social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve her high
ambition.Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen a means of
reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and through her the
leader of the most exclusive social set in the metropolis, is
difficult to say.But thus does the human mind often seek to further
its own dubious aims through guileless innocence and trust.Hawley-Crowles had likewise a slight trace of that clairvoyance
of wisdom which so characterized the girl.But with this difference,
that she knew not why she was led to adopt certain means; while
Carmen, penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own dominant
thought.Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now the stone before the
door of their hope, and Carmen the lever by which these calculating
women intended it should be moved."The Beaubien, my dear," explained Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to her
inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely away
from New York, "is J. Wilton Ames's very particular friend, of long
standing.As I told you, I have recently been going through my late
unpleasant husband's effects, and have unearthed letters and memoranda
which throw floods of light upon Jim's early indiscretions and his
association with both the Beaubien and Ames.Jim once told me, in a
burst of alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton's
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless gratitude,
as well as for never permitting him to darken her door again.Now I
have never met the Beaubien.But I dare say she knows
all about us.However, the point that concerns us now is this: she has
a hold on Ames, and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints
to him that his wife's dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately revised."The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit was not to
be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique.It was not as social
dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan city where polite
society is infinitely complex in its make-up such a position can
scarcely be said to exist.It was rather as an influence that she was
felt, an influence never seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly
inexplicable, working now through this channel, now through that, and
effecting changes in the social complexion of conservative New York
that were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention.Particularly was her power felt in the narrow circle over which Mrs.J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her husband's
aristocratic descent, and the latter's bursting coffers and supremacy
in the realm of finance.Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman would have
been short-lived.But, whatever else might be said of her, the
Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively uncanny.Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn; black, wavy, abundant hair;
eyes whose dark, liquid depths held unfathomable mysteries; gracious,
affable, yet keen as a razor blade; tender, even sentimental on
occasions, with an infinite capacity for either love or hate, this
many-sided woman, whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or
roue at her table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an
orphanage or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival with
the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of the future.It was said of her that she might have laid down her life for the man
she loved.It is probable that she never met with one worth the
sacrifice.While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding school, near
a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills, with a French
Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her age.With him she had
spent eight increasingly miserable years in Paris.Then, her withered
romance carefully entombed in the secret places of her heart, she
secured a divorce from the roistering colonel, together with a small
settlement, and set sail for New York to hunt for larger and more
valuable game.With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she rented an
expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city, and then
settled down to business.Whether she would have fallen upon bad days
or not will never be known, for the first haul of her widespread net
landed a fish of supreme quality, J. Wilton Ames.On the plea of
financial necessity, she had gone boldly to his office with the deed
to a parcel of worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey
shore, which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon her
when she severed the tie which bound them, and which, after weeks of
careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract owned by Ames.Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she reached the inner
_sanctum_ of the astonished financier himself and offered to sell at a
ruinous figure.A few well-timed tears, an expression of angelic
innocence on her beautiful face, a despairing gesture or two with her
lovely arms, coupled with the audacity which she had shown in forcing
an entrance into his office, effected the man's capitulation.She was
then in her twenty-fourth year.The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted herself
thenceforth with tender consecration to her important catch.In time
Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James Hawley-Crowles, to call
upon the charming Beaubien.In time, too, as was perfectly natural, a
rivalry sprang up between the men, which the beautiful creature
watered so tenderly that the investments which she was enabled to make
under the direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack's
beanstalk, and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and take
a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles reached the
breaking point; and then the former decided that the woman's
bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.He forthwith drew
the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into certain business deals, with the
gentle connivance of the suave Beaubien herself, and at length sold
the man out short and presented a claim on every dollar he possessed.Hawley-Crowles awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.But
then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had to be effected,
whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved, though the man should
see the Beaubien no more.By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion, and her
prowess had been fairly tried.She took a large house, furnished it
like unto a palace, and proceeded to throw her gauntlet in the face of
the impregnable social caste.There she drew about her a circle of
bon-vivants, artists, litterateurs, politicians, and men of
finance--with never a woman in the group.Yet in her new home she
established a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed the
bounds of respectful decorum.His name was heard no more on her rosy
lips.Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over the rare
wines and imperial cigars which she furnished, her guests passed many
a tip and prognostication anent the market, which she in turn quietly
transmitted to her brokers.She came to understand the game
thoroughly, and, while it was her heyday of glorious splendor, she
played hard.She had bartered every priceless gift of nature for
gold--and she made sure that the measure she received in return was
full.Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those charms
would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim intention that when
it came silken ease should compensate for their loss.Ten years passed, and the Beaubien's reign continued with undimmed
splendor.In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton Ames had reached the
zenith of her ambitions and was the acknowledged leader in New York's
most fashionable social circle.But, though
the Beaubien had never sought the entree to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised a
certain control over it through her influence upon the man Ames.Ames knew of the long-continued relations between her husband and
this woman was never divulged.And doubtless she was wholly satisfied
that his wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to his own
methods of obtaining diversion.But rumor was persistent, maliciously
so; and rumor declared that the list of this envied society dame was
not drawn up without the approval of her husband and the woman with
whom his leisure hours were invariably spent.Hawley-Crowles, whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed wake
of the luxurious Beaubien.Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced no objection
whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles home.Indeed, she secretly
rejoiced that an opportunity had been so easily afforded for escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the Elwin school, and for entrance
into the great world of people and affairs, where she believed the
soil prepared for the seed she would plant.That dire surprises
awaited her, of which she could not even dream, did not enter her
calculations.Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection of
its worldly, scheming inmates.In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the girl
strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings, and to
the undreamed of marvels which made for physical comfort and
well-being.Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a fortune--enough, she thought,
to buy the whole town of Simiti!Her gowns seemed woven on fairy
looms, and often she would sit for hours, holding them in her lap and
reveling in their richness.Then, when at length she could bring
herself to don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses,
she would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her."Oh," she would exclaim, "it can't be that the girl reflected there
ever lived and dressed as I did in Simiti!I wonder, oh, I wonder if
Padre Jose knew that these things were in the world!"And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself into the
hands of the admiring French maid, she would close her eyes and dream
that the fairy-stories which the patient Jose had told her again and
again in her distant home town had come true, and that she had been
transformed into a beautiful princess, who would some day go in search
of the sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy of
Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send monetary
contributions--and of her unanswered letters--of the war devastating
her native land--of rudely severed ties, and unimaginable changes--and
she would start from her musing and brush away the gathering tears,
and try to realize that her present situation and environment were but
means to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do His
work, with no thought of herself.A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new home, during
which she had left the house only for her diurnal ride in the big
limousine, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles announced her readiness to fire the
first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien."My dear," she said to her
sister, as they sat alone in the luxurious sun-parlor, "my washerwoman
dropped a remark the other day which gave me something to build on.Her two babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street.Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien's sole
charity--in fact, it is her particular hobby.I presume that she feels
she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the time is not far distant
when she will have to close up her earthly accounts and hand them over
to the heavenly auditor.Anyway, this last year or two she has
suddenly become philanthropic, and when the General Orphan Asylum was
building she gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her
name.What's more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without the
wink of an eyelash."But here's the point: some rich old fellow has willed the institution
a fund whose income every year is used to buy clothing for the
kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration on the day the duds are
given out, and the public is invited to inspect the place and the
inmates, and eat a bit, and look around generally.Well, my
washerwoman tells me that the Beaubien always attends these annual
celebrations.The next one, I learn, comes in about a month.I propose
that we attend; take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the
children, and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien,
who will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her.I'll have a
word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to her for saving
Jim's fortune years ago when he was entangled in her net--and, well,
if that scheme doesn't work, I have other strings to my bow."But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most sanguine
hopes of its projector.On the day that the General Orphan Asylum
threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles limousine
rubbed noses with the big French car of the Beaubien in the street
without; while within the building the Beaubien held the hand of the
beautiful girl whose voluntary singing had spread a veil of silence
over the awed spectators in the great assembly room, and, looking
earnestly down into the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: "My dear
child, I want to know you."Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon, with
your permission."Hawley-Crowles wildly hugged her
sister and the girl all the way home--then went to bed that night with
tears of apprehension in her washed-out eyes, lest she had shown
herself too eager in granting the Beaubien's request.But her fears
were turned to exultation when the Beaubien car drew up at her door
the following day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur
announced his errand.A few moments later, while the car glided
purring over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the dead little
town so far away.CHAPTER 9


"Sing it again, dear.I know you are tired, but I want to hear that
song just once more.Somehow it seems to bring up thoughts of--of
things that might have been."The Beaubien's voice sank to a whisper
as she finished.Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird lament which
had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges a few days before."I--I don't know why that song affects me so," mused the Beaubien,
when the girl had finished and returned to the seat beside her.Then,
abruptly: "I wish you could play the pipe-organ out in the hall.I put
twelve thousand dollars into it, and I can't even play five-finger
exercises on it."exclaimed Carmen, drawing a long breath,
while her eyes dilated."Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose we just go down there
and buy the whole town.It would at least give me an interest in life.Do you think I could stand the heat there?How did you live, and what did you do?And are
you really descended from the old Incas?"They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them, At one end of
the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled in the huge
fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early spring day and casting
a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls and polished floor in front,
where dozed the Beaubien's two "babies," Japanese and Pekingese
spaniels of registered pedigree and fabulous value.Among the heavy
beams of the lofty ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered,
while over the costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued
lights played in animated pantomime.Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance into the
room.Everything in the woman's environment was softened into the same
degree of voluptuousness which characterized her and the life of
sybaritic ease which she affected.From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been charmed,
fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless wealth and
the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious manifestation.The
Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her the epitome of material
elegance and comfort, far exceeding the most fantastic concepts of her
childish imagination, when she had listened enraptured to Padre
Jose's compelling stories of the great world beyond Simiti.But the
gorgeous web of this social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles
mansion suffer in comparison."And yet," said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could no longer
restrain her wonder and admiration, "this is but a shed beside the new
Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.I presume he will put not less
than ten millions into it before it is finished."Carmen dared not attempt to grasp the
complex significance of such an expenditure."Why, is that such a huge amount, child?"asked the Beaubien, as
accustomed to think in eight figures as in two."But, I forget that
you are from the jungle.she mused, gazing
with undisguised admiration at the beautiful, animated girl before
her.Carmen was struggling with the
deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened her eyes upon her as
if she would have them bore deep into the soul of whose rarity she was
becoming slowly aware.What thoughts coursed through the mind of the
Beaubien as she sat studying the girl through the tempered light, we
may not know.What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told.Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this creature
of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl's great innocence and
purity of thought, her righteousness?Or did she see in her something
that she herself might once have been--something that all her gold,
and all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind could never buy?"What have you got," she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed, "that I
haven't?"And then the banality of the question struck her, and she
laughed harshly."Why," said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon the woman,
"you have everything!"You," returned the woman quickly, though she knew not why she said
it.And yet, memory was busy uncovering those bitter days when, in the
first agony of marital disappointment, she had, with hot, streaming
tears, implored heaven to give her a child.But the gift had been
denied; and her heart had shrunk and grown heavily calloused.Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice which
stirred the girl's quick sympathy."Yes, you have youth, and beauty.But I could part with them, gladly, if only
there were anything left."Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her.Forgetful of caste,
decorum, convention, everything but the boundless love which she felt
for all mankind, she put her arms about the worldly woman's neck and
kissed her.For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise.It was the only
manifestation of selfless love that had ever come into her sordid
experience.that it was an
act of real sympathy, and not a clever ruse to win her from behind the
mask of affection?Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for
favors.they drew not many now, although time was when a single
one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.The girl herself quickly met the woman's groping thought."I'm in the
world to show what love will do," she murmured; "and I love you."Had
she not thus solved every problem from earliest childhood?Not even a heart of stone could withstand the
solvent power of such love.Her head dropped upon her breast, and she
wept."Don't cry," said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered cheek."Why, we are all God's children; we all have one another; you have me,
and I have you; and God means us all to be happy."The Beaubien looked up, wondering.Her variegated life included no
such tender experience as this.She had long since ceased to shed
aught but tears of anger.But now--

She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then gently
motioned her back to her chair."Don't mind it," she smiled, with
swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment."I don't know of anything
that would help me as much as a good cry.If I could have had a
daughter like you, I should--but never mind now."She tried to laugh,
as she wiped her eyes.Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and she became
suddenly animated."Why--listen," she said; "don't you want to learn
the pipe-organ?I will pay for
them; I will engage the best teacher in New York; and you shall take
two or three a week, and use the big organ out in the hall.Carmen's heart gave a great leap."I'll do it myself," returned the woman with growing enthusiasm."William," she directed, when the butler responded to her summons,
"get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.But who is coming, I
wonder?"glancing through the window at an automobile that had drawn
up at her door.a look of vexation mantling her face, "the
Right Reverend Monsignor Lafelle.Well," turning to Carmen, "I suppose
I'll have to send you home now, dear.Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall speak
to her at that time about your music lessons.William, take Monsignor
into the morning room, and then tell Henri to bring the car to the
porte-cochere for Miss Carmen.Good-bye, dear," kissing the bright,
upturned face of the waiting girl."I wish I could--but, well, don't
forget that I'm coming for you to-morrow."Hawley-Crowles directed her French tailor to cable
to Paris for advance styles.Twenty-four hours later she hastened with
outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien, waiting in the reception
room.Oh, yes, they had heard often of each other; and now were so
pleased to meet!New York was such a whirlpool, and it was so
difficult to form desirable friendships.Yes, the Beaubien had known
the late-lamented Hawley-Crowles; but, dear!that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both young and
foolish.Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and me to be mutually
helpful at a time when I was in sore need of a friend; and the debt of
gratitude is not yours to me, but mine to your kind husband."Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.What cared she
that her husband's always unsavory name had been linked with this
woman's?She had married the roistering blade for his bank account
only.Any other male whose wealth ran into seven figures would have
done as well, or better.Hawley-Crowles gratefully
accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien mansion for the girl;
but she herself insisted upon bearing the expense of the lessons.Together, she and the Beaubien,
they would foster and develop it.Moreover, though of course this must
follow later, she intended to give the girl every social advantage
befitting her beauty, her talents, and her station.And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just how long to
stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles turned
to her sister with her face flushed with anger.she exclaimed, while hot tears suffused her eyes."The hussy went away
actually laughing at me!What do you suppose she's got up her sleeve?But, let me tell you, she'll not fool me!I'll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I've done that, I'll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor old Jim!"*       *       *       *       *

There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow across the full
splendor of Carmen's happiness, the silence that shrouded Simiti.But
Harris was preparing to return to Colombia, and his trip promised a
solution of the mystery of her unanswered letters.For weeks Carmen
had struggled to teach him Spanish, with but small measure of success."You'll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter," he said one day, when they were alone in the
Hawley-Crowles parlor.Then a curious light came into his eyes, and he
blurted, "Will you?"But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though she knew
not from what depths it had sprung.Harris shrugged his broad
shoulders and sighed.He had not a hundred dollars to his name.Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest he
shared with Reed in La Libertad.For, despite the disturbed state of
affairs in Colombia, Simiti stock had sold rapidly, under the sedulous
care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a sufficient fund had been
accumulated to warrant the inauguration of development work on the
mine.A few years hence Harris should be rich from that source alone.Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature which
Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting engineer
to the Simiti Development Company.His wife had continued her
temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles mansion, while awaiting with
what fortitude she could command the passing of her still vigorous
father, and the results of her defiant sister's assaults upon the Ames
set.The wonderful organ in the Beaubien
mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over her soul, and daily she
sat before it, uncovering new marvels and losing herself deeper and
deeper in its infinite mysteries.Her progress was commensurate with
her consecration, and brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips
of her now devoted Beaubien.Hour after hour the latter would sit in
the twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried for
long, meaningless years.They now talked but little, this strange
woman and the equally strange girl.Their communion was no longer of
the lips.It was the silent yearning of a dry, desolate heart,
striving to open itself to the love which the girl was sending far and
wide in the quenchless hope that it might meet just such a need.For
Carmen dwelt in the spirit, and she instinctively accepted her
splendid material environment as the gift, not of man, but of the
great divine Mind, which had led her into this new world that she
might be a channel for the expression of its love to the erring
children of mortals.She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence as if the
house belonged to her.At first the Beaubien smiled indulgently.And
then her smile became a laugh of eager joy as she daily greeted her
radiant visitor, whose entrance into the great, dark house was always
followed by a flood of sunshine, and whose departure marked the
setting in of night to the heart-hungry woman.In the first days of
their association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled her
evenings and sat about her board.But as days melted into weeks, she
became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the transition; and
the hour at length arrived when she fully realized that she was facing
the most momentous decision that had ever been evolved by her worldly
mode of living.But that was a matter of slow development through many
months.Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds.A week after Carmen
began the study of the organ she boldly ventured to accompany her one
day to the Beaubien citadel.She was graciously received, and departed
with the Beaubien's promise to return the call.Thereupon she set
about revising her own social list, and dropped several names which
she now felt could serve her no longer.Her week-end at Newport, just
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of the
gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully upon its summer
_siesta_.Even the theaters and concert halls were closed, and the
metropolis was nodding its weary head dully and sinking into
somnolence.The
summer interim would give her time to further her plans and prepare
the girl for her social _debut_ in the early winter."And Milady Ames
will be mentioned in the papers next day as assisting at the
function--the cat!"she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her
revised list of social desirables.But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent entry into
polite society Mrs.Hawley-Crowles soon realized that she had
assumed a task of generous proportions.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and replied
calmly, "Neither, Madam; it remains quite neutral.""Pardon me if I say it; not at all."she murmured, her eagerness subsiding."Then I've made an awful
mistake!""No," he amended gently, "you have made a good friend.And, as such, I
again urge you first to respect the leaning which you mentioned a
moment ago and become actively affiliated with our Church here in New
York."Certainly I will consider it," she responded, brightening with hope."And I will go so far as to say that I have long had it in mind.""Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss the less
important matter of your ward's entrance into society--is it not so?"Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited."But the girl,
Monsignor, is already a Catholic--comes from a Catholic country.It is
she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.""You are cruel," she retorted, affecting an air of injured innocence
as she stood before him with downcast eyes."But--if you--"

"Madam," said Monsignor, "plainly, what is it that you wish me to
do?"The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally sudden but less
thoughtful response."Tell the Beau--Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward to be received
into the best society, and for the reasons I have given you."And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with the members of
fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?"he asked, an odd look
coming into his eyes."She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his wife will
receive us both," said the woman, carried away by her eagerness."And
that means strong Catholic influence in New York's most aristocratic
set!""Monsignor," continued the woman eagerly, "will your Church receive an
altar from me in memory of my late husband?"Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest tone, "It
would receive such a gift from one of the faith.When may we expect
you to become a communicant?"The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled.She had wondered how
far she might go with this clever churchman, and now she knew that she
had gone too far.But to retract--to have him relate this conversation
and her retraction to the Beaubien--were fatal!She had set her
trap--and walked into it.Then,
raising her eyes and meeting his searching glance, she murmured
feebly, "Whenever you say, Monsignor."When the man had departed, which he did immediately, the plotting
woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept with rage."Belle,"
she wailed, as her wondering sister entered the room, "I'm going to
join the Catholic Church!But I'd go through Sheol to beat that Ames
outfit!"CHAPTER 11


MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on the Beaubien a few
days later.That lady, fresh from her bath, scented, powdered, and
charming in a loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously."But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor," she said, waving him to
a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up the two spaniels."I
have a dinner to-night, and so shall not listen unless you have
something fresh and really worth while to offer.""My dear Madam," said he, bowing low before he sank into the great
leather armchair, "you are charming, and the Church is justly proud of
you.""Tut, tut, my friend," she returned, knitting her brows."That may be
fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to.And if you persist in that
vein I shall be obliged to have William set you into the street.""I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam," he replied,
as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure."The Church has
never ceased to claim you, however far you may have wandered from her.I am leaving for Canada shortly on a mission of
some importance.May I not take with me the consoling assurance that
you have at last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother,
who has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?""There," she said gently, "I thought
that was it.No, Monsignor, no," shaking her head."When only a wild,
thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order that I might marry
Gaspard de Beaubien.The priest urged; and I--<DW30>!But
the past eighteen years have confirmed me in some views; and one is
that I shall gain nothing, either here or hereafter, by renewing my
allegiance to the Church of Rome."Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair."I learned this morning," he said musingly, "that my
recent labors with the Dowager Duchess of Altern in England have not
been vain.She has become a communicant of Holy Church.""The Duchess of Altern--sister of Mrs.Why, she was a high Anglican--"

"Only a degree below the true Church, Madam.Her action is but
anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican Church to the
true fold.And I learn further," he went on, "that the Duchess will
spend the winter in New York with her sister.Which means, of course,
an unusually gay season here, does it not?"The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment."Well,
Monsignor," she laughed, "for once you really are interesting.Ames herself will be the next
convert?But one of your most intimate friends will
become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday."The Beaubien set the spaniels down
on the floor."Now, my dear Monsignor, you are positively refreshing."Am I not right when I insist that you have
wandered far, dear Madam?It is not 'he,' but'she,' your dear friend,
Mrs.The Beaubien's mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly upright and
gazed blankly at her raconteur.The man went on, apparently oblivious
of the effect his information had produced."Her beautiful ward, who
is to make her bow to society this winter, is one of us by birth.""Then you have been at work on Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward, have
you?"said the Beaubien severely, and there was a threatening note in
her voice."Why," returned Monsignor easily, "the lady sent for me to express her
desire to become affiliated with the Church.And I
have had no conversation with the girl, I assure you."Then:

"Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles takes this
unusual step?"Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has seen much of the
world to turn from it to the solace and promise of the Church?"Hawley-Crowles it
is, decidedly."Monsignor, I do not.And by this time you
do, too.She is the last woman in the world to turn from it.""But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously upon
both the Church and me--"

"Bah!"interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing."Wait," she
commanded imperiously, as he rose."I have a few things to say to you,
since this is to be your last call.""Madam, not the last, I hope.For I shall not cease to plead the cause
of the Church to you--"

"Surely, Monsignor, that is your business.You are welcome in my
house at any time, and particularly when you have such delightful
scraps of gossip as these which you have brought to-day.But, a word
before you go, lest you become indiscreet on your return.Hawley-Crowles to any extent you wish, but let her ward
alone--_absolutely_!The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no doubt in the
man's mind of her meaning.She was not trifling with him now, he knew.In her low-voiced words he found no trace of banter, of sophistry, nor
of aught that he might in any wise misinterpret."Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as you may
possibly know.Will you admit that I can do much for or against you?Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me frankly just what has induced
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to unite with your Church."The man knew he was pitting his own against a master mind.He
hesitated and weighed well his words before replying."Madam," said he
at length, with a note of reproach, "you misjudge the lady, the
Church, and me, its humble servant.Hawley-Crowles, I speak truly when I say that doubtless she
has been greatly influenced by love for her late husband."The Beaubien half rose from her chair."Jim Crowles--that raw,
Irish boob, who was holding down a job on the police force until Ames
found he could make a convenient tool of him!The man who was
Gannette's cat's-paw in the Fall River franchise steal!Now,
Monsignor, would you have me believe you devoid of all sense?""But," ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and for the
moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched use of his
facts, "she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a memorial to
him!"Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise.He felt that he was guilty
of a miserable _faux pas_."Madam, I regret that I must be leaving.But the hour--"

"Stay, Monsignor!"The Beaubien roused up and laid a detaining hand
upon his arm."Our versatile friend, what other projects has she in
hand?"Why, really, I can not say--beyond the fact that the girl is to be
introduced to society this winter."Going to make a try for the Ames set?""That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid."Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?"demanded the woman,
leaning forward eagerly."Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I say that she
intimated as much," he said, watching her closely and sparring now
with better judgment.Ames as New York's
fashionable society leader--"

"There is no such position as leader in New York society, Monsignor,"
interrupted the Beaubien coldly."There are sets and cliques, and
Mrs.Ames happens to be prominent in the one which at present
foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper stratum.Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but a tarnished name and a large bank
account to recommend her, now wishes to break into that clique and
attain social leadership, does she?Then the woman's eyes narrowed and grew hard.Leaning closer to
the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his knee."So, Monsignor," she said, with cold precision, "this is Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's method of renouncing the world, is it?And she would use both you and me, eh?And you are her ambassador
at the court of the Beaubien?Very well, then, she shall use us.But you and I will first make this compact, my dear Monsignor:
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles shall be taken into the so-called 'Ames set,'
and you shall cease importuning me to return to your Church, and
what is more, shall promise to have no conversation on church
matters with her ward, the young girl.If you do not agree to
this, Monsignor, I shall set in motion forces that will make your
return to New York quite undesirable."When she concluded, she
looked long and steadily into his eyes.Monsignor got slowly to his feet.he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, "my astonishment--"

"There," she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand, "please omit
the dramatics, Monsignor.And now you must go, for to-night I
entertain, and I have already given you more time than I intended.But, Monsignor, do you in future work with or against me?"Why, Madam," he replied quickly, "we could never be the latter!""And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially if she is a
lady, do you not?""Always, Madam," he returned after a moment's hesitation, as he bowed
low over her hand.And, Monsignor," she added, when he reached the door,
"I shall be pleased to attend the dedication of the Hawley-Crowles
altar."When Monsignor's car glided away from her door the Beaubien's face
grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits."So," she reflected, as
she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing room, "that is her
game, is it?The poor, fat simpleton has no interest in either the
girl or myself, other than to use us as stepping-stones.She forgets
that a stone sometimes turns under the foot.She entered her room and rang for her maid.Turning to the pier glass,
she threw on the electric light and scrutinized her features narrowly."It's going," she murmured, "fast!Oh, what a farce life is--what a howling, mocking farce!No--that little girl--if it is possible
for me to love, I love her.""I wonder what it is she does to me.I'm
hypnotized, I guess.Anyhow, I'm different when I'm with her.And to
think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice the child--humph!But, if
the girl is made of the right stuff--and I know she is--she will stand
up under it and be stronger for the experience.She has got something
that will make her stand!I once asked her what she had that I didn't,
and now I know--it is her religion, the religion that Borwell and
Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would corrupt if
they had half a chance!Very well, we'll see what it does under the
test.If it saves her, then I want it myself.But, as for that little
pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she's already signed her own death-warrant.She shall get into the Ames set, yes.And I will use her, oh,
beautifully!to pay off certain old scores against Madam Ames--and
then I'll crush her like a dried leaf, the fat fool!"The Beaubien's position was, to say the least, peculiar, and one which
required infinite tact on her part to protect.It was for that reason
that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners was so rigidly
observed, and that, whatever the moral status of the man who sat at
her board, his conduct was required to be above reproach, on penalty
of immediate ejection from the circle of financial pirates, captains
of commercial jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts
opportunities for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly gowned
Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had gathered almost
nightly for years to rig the market, determine the price of wheat or
cotton, and develop mendacious schemes of stock-jobbery whose golden
harvests they could calculate almost to a dollar before launching.As
the wealth of this clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all
bounds, so increased their power, until at last it could be justly
said that, when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the
Beaubien practically controlled Wall Street--and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself.But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued to pay
homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful intellect.At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith, and she
could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest, most aristocratic
society dame, or force the door of the most exclusive set for any
protegee who might have been kept long years knocking in vain, or
whose family name, perchance, headed a list of indictments for gross
peculations.At these unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark,
mahogany-wainscoted dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a
single lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon the
sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely guarded room
shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid and decrees adopted
which seated judges, silenced clergymen, elected senators, and
influenced presidents.There a muck-raking, hostile press was muffled.There business opposition was crushed and competition throttled.There
tax rates were determined and tariff schedules formulated.There
public opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the
death-warrant of every threatening reformer drawn and signed.In a
word, there Mammon, in the _role_ of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of human
endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.These
wires were gathered together into the hands of one man, the directing
genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames.Over him lay the shadow of the
Beaubien.An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien, like a
radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her assembled guests.Some moments later the heavy doors of the great dining room swung
noiselessly open, and the lady proceeded unescorted to her position at
the head of the table.At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and
the butler immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course.The chair at the far end of the table,
opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied."Ames is late to-night," observed the girthy Gannette, glancing toward
the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to tuck his napkin into his
collar.The Beaubien looked sharply at him."Were you at the club this
afternoon, Mr.Gannette straightened up and became rigid.Pulling the napkin down
hastily, he replied in a thick voice, "Just a little game of
bridge--some old friends--back from Europe--"

The Beaubien turned to the butler.Gannette is not
drinking wine this evening."The butler bowed and removed the glasses
from that gentleman's place."Now, Lucile--" he began peevishly.The Beaubien held up a hand.Gannette glowered and sank down in his
chair like a swollen toad."May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors'
meeting," suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides."They tell me," said Fitch, "that for once Ames has been outwitted,
and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim."queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and the most
mettlesome speculator of the group."Why," explained Weston, "some months ago Ames tried to reach Ed.Stolz through Ketchim, the old man's nephew, and get control of C. and
R. But friend nephew dropped the portcullis just as Ames was dashing
across the drawbridge, and J. Wilton found himself outside, looking
through the bars.First time I've ever known that to happen.Now the
boys have got hold of it on 'Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.""Long time leaking out, seems to me," remarked Kane."But what's Ames
going to do about it?""He seems to have dropped the
matter.""I think you will find yourself mistaken," put in the Beaubien
evenly.queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.Ames always gets what he goes
after, and he will secure control of C. and R.vigorously asserted Murdock, who had been an
interested listener."I have one thousand dollars that says he will," said the Beaubien,
calmly regarding the speaker.Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no time recovering
his poise.Drawing out his own book he wrote a check in the Beaubien's
name for the amount and sent it down the table to her.Fitch will hold the stakes," said the woman, handing him the two
slips of paper."And we will set a time limit of eighteen months.""By the way," remarked Peele, the only one of the group who had taken
no part in the preceding conversation, "I see by the evening paper
that there's been another accident in the Avon mills.Fellow named
Marcus caught in a machine and crushed all out of shape.That's the
third one down there this month.They'll force Ames to equip his mills
with safety devices if this keeps up.""Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the Legislature,"
returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile."But," she added more
seriously, "that is not where the danger lies.The real source of
apprehension is in the possibility of a strike.And if war breaks out
among those Hungarians down there it will cost him more than to equip
all his mills now with safety devices."Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up."Speaking
of war," he growled, "has Ames, or any of you fellows, got a
finger in the muddle in South America?I've got interests down
there--concessions and the like--and by--!"He wandered off into
incoherent mutterings.The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler.cried Gannette, his apoplectic face becoming
more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering angrily upon the calm
woman."I ain't a-goin' to stand this!I'm as sober
as any one here, an'--" William took the heavy man gently by the arm
and persuaded him to his feet.The other guests suppressed their
smiles and remained discreetly quiet."Have Henri take him to his club, William," said the Beaubien, rising.We will expect you Wednesday evening, and
we trust that we will not have to accept your excuses again."Gannette was led soddenly out.The Beaubien quietly resumed her seat.It was the second time the man had been dismissed from her table, and
the guests marveled that it did not mean the final loss of her favor.But she remained inscrutable; and the conversation quickly drifted
into new channels.A few moments later William returned and made a
quiet announcement:

"Mr.A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.The Beaubien
immediately rose and advanced to greet the newcomer.she
whispered, taking his hand.The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face.His only reply
was a reassuring pressure of her hand.But she comprehended, and her
face brightened."Gentlemen," remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, "the President's
message is out.I have been going over it with Hood--which accounts
for my tardiness," he added, nodding pleasantly to the Beaubien."Quoting from our chief executive's long list of innocent platitudes,
I may say that 'private monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly
indefensible, and not to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the
premise of equal rights to all mankind.'"concurred Weston, holding up his glass and gazing
admiringly at the rich color of the wine."Quite my sentiments, too," murmured Fitch,
rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor success to assume a
beatific expression."Furthermore," continued Ames, with mock gravity, "the interlocking of
corporation directorates must be prohibited by law; power must be
conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to superintend the
financial management of railroads; holding-companies must cease to
exist; and corrective policies must be shaped, whereby so-called
'trusts' will be regulated and rendered innocuous."We are," said they all, in one voice."Carried," concluded Ames in a solemn tone.Then a burst of laughter
rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William smiled behind
his hand."But, seriously," said Weston, when the laughter had ceased, "I
believe we've got a President now who's going to do something, don't
you?""As long as the human mind
remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though Congress legislate
itself blue in the face.Reform is not to be made like a garment and
forced upon the people from the outside.Restrictive measures have not as yet, in all the history of
civilization, reformed a single criminal.""That we are puncture-proof," replied Ames with a light laugh."But what about your indictment in that cotton deal?Is Hood going to
find you law-proof there?""The case is settled," said Ames easily."I went into court this
morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring to corner
the cotton market two years ago.I admitted that I violated the
Sherman law.The judge promptly fined me three thousand dollars, for
which I immediately wrote a check, leaving me still the winner by some
two million seven hundred thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing
of compound interest on the three thousand for the past two years.You
see the beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?""By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us in on that!""Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen," replied Ames simply."Well," remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, "suppose we get down
to the business of the evening--if agreeable to our hostess," bowing
in the direction of the Beaubien."Has any one
anything new to offer?""There is a little
matter," he began, "that I have been revolving for some days.It occurred to
me some time ago that a franchise for a trolley line on that road
could be secured and ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy
residents whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million
dollars rather than have a line built there.After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building of
the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner of Highways.He
reported that it would be the means of destroying the post road.I
convinced him, on the other hand, that it would be the means of lining
his purse with fifty thousand dollars.So he very naturally gave it
his endorsement.I then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and
had him arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany.I think," he
concluded, "that about five hundred thousand dollars will grease the
wheels all 'round.I've got the Governor on the hip in that Southern
Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out of my hand.I'll lay
this project on the table now, and you can take it up if you so
desire.""The scheme seems all right," commented Weston, after a short
meditation."Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us would at
least provide for a yachting party next summer," remarked Ames
sententiously."And no work connected with it--in fact, the work has
been done.I shall want an additional five per cent for handling it."An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a motion that
the group definitely take up the project.The Beaubien put the vote,
and it was carried without dissent."What about that potato scheme you were figuring on, Ames?"asked
Fitch at this juncture."I didn't get much encouragement from my
friends," he replied."I don't believe it," put in Weston emphatically."I have one million dollars that says it could," returned Ames calmly.Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender.he
exclaimed, scurrying for cover."Well," he said, "suppose we look into the scheme and
see if we don't want to handle it.It simply calls for a little
thought and work.He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien for approval.She nodded, and
he went on:

"I have lately been investigating the subject of various food supplies
other than wheat and corn as possible bases for speculation, and my
attention has been drawn strongly to a very humble one, potatoes."But Ames continued
unperturbed:

"I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so plentiful at
times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.My investigations
have covered a period of several months, and now I have in my
possession a large map of the United States with the potato sections,
prices, freight rates and all other necessary data indicated.My idea is to send agents into all these
sections next summer before the potatoes are turned up, and contract
for the entire crop at twenty-five cents a bushel.The agents will pay
the farmers cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging,
packing, shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption.Needless to say, the potatoes will not
be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot in the ground.Those that do reach the market will sell for a dollar and a half in
New York and Chicago.""In other words," added Fitch, "you are simply figuring to corner the
market for the humble tuber, eh?""But--you say you have all the necessary data now?""All, even to the selection of a few of my agents.I can control
freight rates for what we may wish to ship.The rest of the crop will
be left to rot.And the
consumers will pay our price for what they must have.""And how much do you figure we shall
need to round the corner?""A million, cash in hand," replied Ames."Is this anything that the women can mix into?""You know they forced us to dump tons of our cold-storage stuff onto
the market two years ago.""That was when I controlled wheat," said Ames, "and was all tied up.It will be done so quietly
and thoroughly that it will all be over and the profits pocketed
before the women wake up to what we're doing.In this case there will
be nothing to store.And potatoes exposed in the field rot quickly,
you know."The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some moments.Then
the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if he would agree to handle the
project, provided they took it up."Yes," assented Ames, "on a five per cent basis.And I am ready to put
agents in the field to-morrow.""Then, Madam Beaubien," said Fitch, "I move that we adopt the plan as
set forth by Mr.Ames, and commission him to handle it, calling upon
us equally for whatever funds he may need."A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution was
unanimously adopted."Say, Ames," queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in his eyes,
"will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and R.?"A laugh
went up around the table, in which Ames himself joined."Yes," he
said, "potatoes and cotton will both go over that road next summer,
and I shall fix the rebates."suggested Fitch, with a wink at
Murdock.Ames's mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face."Ketchim is
going to Sing Sing for that little deal," he returned in a low, cold
tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not repress a little
shudder."I had him on Molino, but he trumped up a new company which
absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody, so I am blocked for the
present.But, mark me, I shall strip him of every dollar, and then put
him behind the bars before I've finished!"And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he spoke truth.At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall clock were
sending their trembling message through the dark house, the Beaubien
rose, and the dinner was concluded.A few moments later the guests
were spinning in their cars to their various homes or clubs--all but
Ames.As he was preparing to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his
arm."Wait a moment, Wilton," she said."I have something important to
discuss with you."She led him into the morning room, where a fire was
blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair before it for him,
then nestled on the floor at his feet."I sent Gannette home this evening," she began, by way of introduction.I would drop him entirely, only you said--"

"We need him," interrupted Ames."I'll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you.Now tell me," she
went on eagerly, "what about Colombia?Have you any further news from
Wenceslas?"The Church is
with the Government, and they will win--although your money may be
tied up for a few years.Still, you can't lose in the end."The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.Then:

"Lafelle was here again to-day.""Hold him, too," said Ames quickly."Looks as if I had made you a sort
of holding company, doesn't it?""But we
shall have good use for these fellows.""He gave me some very interesting news," she said; and then went on to
relate the conversation in detail.Ames laughed loudly as he
listened."And now, Wilton," said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, "you have always said that you never forgave me
for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had him by the throat.Well, I'm going to give you a chance to get more than even.Jim's fat
widow is after your wife's scalp.I intend that she shall lose her own
in the chase.I've got my plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet
the lovely Mrs.Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch's next Thursday afternoon.It will be just a formal call--mutual introductions--and, later, an
invitation from Mrs.Meantime, I want you
to get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles involved in a financial way, and shear her
of every penny!"My dear," said he, taking her hand, "you are charming this
evening.she deprecated, although the smile she gave him
attested her pleasure in the compliment."Well," she continued
briskly, "if I'm so beautiful, you can't help loving me; and if you
love me, you will do what I ask."Really,
I've long since forgotten him.Do you realize that that was more than
ten years ago?""Please don't mention years, dear," she murmured, shuddering a little."Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy a lesson?""Well," he suggested, laughing, "we might get Ketchim after her, to
sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when he goes down, as he
is going one of these days, we will hope that it will leave her on the
rocks of financial ruin, eh?""Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing the sonorous
title of Simiti Development Company, I am told by my brokers."Why--I've heard Carmen mention that name.I wonder--"

"Well, and who is Carmen?""My little friend--the one and only honest person I've ever dealt
with, excepting, of course, present company."And now where does this Carmen enter the
game?""Why, she's--surely you know about her!""Well, she is a little Colombian--"

"Colombian!"Came up with the engineers who
went down there for Ketchim to examine the Molino properties.She
lived all her life in a town called Simiti until she came up here."Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire."Never heard of
the place," he murmured dreamily."Well," said the Beaubien eagerly, "she's a--a wonderful child!I'm
different when I'm with her."He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the woman."Then I'd
advise you not to be with her much, for I prefer you as you are."Then the woman looked up at her
companion.The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little nervous laugh."Of you," he replied evasively, "always."She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly."You were dreaming of
your awful business deals," she said."What have you in hand
now?--besides the revolution in Colombia, your mines, your mills, your
banks, your railroads and trolley lines, your wheat and potato
corners, your land concessions and cattle schemes, and--well, that's a
start, at least," she finished, pausing for breath.I'm buying every bale I can find, in Europe, Asia, and
the States.""But, Will, you've been caught in cotton before, you know.And I don't
believe you can get away with it again.Unless--"

"That's it--unless," he interrupted."And that's just the part I have
taken care of.The cotton schedule will go
through as I have it outlined.They
don't dare refuse to pass the measure.In a few
months the tariff on cotton products will be up.The new tariff-wall
sends the price of raw stuff soaring.I
was beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather
prognostications.I'll let you in, if you wish.But these other fellows have got
to stay out.""I haven't a penny to invest, Will," she replied mournfully."You got
me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.""Oh, well," he returned easily, "I'll lend you what you need, any
amount.And you can give me your advice and suggestions from time to
time.As for your Colombian investments, haven't I guaranteed them,
practically?""Not in writing," she said, looking up at him with a twinkle in her
eyes."No, certainly not," she returned, giving him a glance of admiration.Hawley-Crowles is going to be received into your
wife's set, and you are going to give her a good financial whipping?"Hawley-Crowles
shall go to the poor-house, if you say the word.But now, my dear,
have William order my car.Hawley-Crowles at Fitch's?"Yes, dear," murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing him; "next
Thursday at three.Call me on the 'phone to-morrow."CHAPTER 12


The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was originally
only five stories in height.But as the Ames interests grew, floor
after floor was added, until, on the day that Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
pointed it out to Carmen from the window of her limousine, it had
reached, tower and all, a height of twenty-five stories, and was
increasing at an average rate of two additional a year.It was not its
size that aroused interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but
its uniqueness; for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not
house a single business that was not either owned outright or
controlled by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and Company on the
second floor.The haberdashers, the shoe-shining booths, the soda
fountains, and the great commercial enterprises that dwelt about them,
each and all acknowledged fealty and paid homage to the man who
brooded over them in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor
in the tower above.It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers of New
York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer force of what
was doubtless the most dominant character developed in recent
years by those peculiar forces which have produced the American
multimillionaire."And," he once added, when, despite his anger, he could
not but admire Ames's tactical blocking of his piratical move, which
the former's keen foresight had perceived threatened danger at
Washington, "it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him,
but because he knows ten tricks to our one, that's all."To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant, generally, an
expression of admiration for his unusual physique, and a wholly
erroneous appraisal of his character.His build was that of a
gladiator.He stood six-feet-four in height, with Herculean shoulders
and arms, and a pair of legs that suggested nothing so much as the
great pillars which supported the facade of the Ames building.Those
arms and legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college
shell to victory every year that he had sat in the boat.They had won
every game on the gridiron in which he had participated as the
greatest "center" the college ever developed.For baseball he was a
bit too massive, much to his own disappointment, but the honors he
failed to secure there he won in the field events, and in the
surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling bouts when, hidden away in
the cellar of some secret society hall, he would crush his opponents
with an ease and a peculiar glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes
that was grimly prophetic of days to come.His mental attitude toward
contests for superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially
from that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win.If he fell,
well and good; he expected "thumbs down."If he won, his opponent need
look for no exhibition of generosity on his part.When his man lay
prone before him, he stooped and cut his throat.And he would have
loathed the one who forbore to do likewise with himself.In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the physical side of
his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable muscular strength
so great a prize to the various athletic coaches and directors.Ames
was first an animal; there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong
to arouse his latent spirituality.And yet his intellect was keen; and
to those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of finance, he brought
a power of concentration that was as stupendous as his physical
strength.His mental make-up was peculiar, in that it was the epitome
of energy--manifested at first only in brute force--and in that it was
wholly deficient in the sense of fear.Because of this his daring was
phenomenal.Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated with his
father in the already great banking house of Ames and Company.But the
animality of his nature soon found the confinement irksome; his
father's greater conservatism hampered his now rapidly expanding
spirit of commercialism; and after a few years in the banking house he
withdrew and set up for himself.The father, while lacking the boy's
fearlessness, had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son's desire, and, in addition, gave him _carte
blanche_ in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name, already
becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance, with
diversified enterprises which reached into almost every country of the
globe, hastened home from a foreign land in response to a message
announcing the sudden death of his father.The devolving of his
parent's vast fortune upon himself--he was the sole heir--then
necessitated his permanent location in New York.And so, reluctantly
giving up his travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about
him, concentrating his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his huge
fortune.A few months later he married, and the union amalgamated the
proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears fought under the
Conqueror and were written in the Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and
aristocratic Van Heyse branch of old Amsterdam.To this union were
born a son and a daughter, twins.The interval between his graduation from college and the death of his
father was all but unknown to the cronies of his subsequent years in
New York.Though he had spent much of it in the metropolis, he had
been self-centered and absorbed, even lonely, while laying his plans
and developing the schemes which resulted in financial preeminence.With unlimited money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice
of his business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe.Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had become as
well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges of Europe as in his
native land.Confident and successful from the outset; without any
trace of pride or touch of hauteur in his nature; as wholly lacking in
ethical development and in generosity as he was in fear; gradually
becoming more sociable and companionable, although still reticent of
certain periods of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with
years; and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low plane of
his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly for the
pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power which his
accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because it served as an
adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost superhuman, driving energy.If he betrayed and debauched ideals, it was because he was utterly
incapable of rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the
attempt.If he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he
glanced at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the lenses
of self.His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton Ames--and he
never looked beyond.The world had been created for him; the cosmos
but expressed his Ego.On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien regarding the
social aspirations of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the financier sat at his
rich mahogany desk on the top floor of the Ames building in earnest
discussion with his lawyer, Alonzo Hood.The top floor of the tower
was divided into eight rooms.Two of these constituted Ames's inner
_sanctum_; one was Hood's private office; and the rest were devoted
to clerks and stenographers.A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood's room, and handled confidential messages over
private wires to the principal cities in the country.A private
telephone connected Ames's desk with the Beaubien mansion.Private
lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to various other points
throughout the city.The telegraph and telephone companies gave his
messages preference over all others.At a word he would be placed in
almost instant communication with New Orleans, San Francisco, London,
Berlin, or Cairo.Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual was
doing business.At the office of the Telegraph Service up-town he
maintained messengers who carried none but his own despatches.In
the railroad yards his private car stood always in readiness; and in
the harbor his yacht was kept constantly under steam.A motor car
stood ever in waiting in the street below, close to the shaft of a
private automatic elevator, which ran through the building for his
use alone.This elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the
basement of the building, where a private room and a special waiter
were always at the man's disposal.A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and he
had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club up-town.This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o'clock.Before
him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his mills, his
railroads, and his bank.These disposed of, there followed a quick
survey of the day's appointments, arranged for him by his chief
secretary.As the latter entered, Ames was
absorbed in the legend of the stock ticker."C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six," he commented.Then,
swinging back in his chair, "What's Stolz doing?""For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,"
replied Hood."Now we will begin to get real information," he
remarked."Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty dollars a week from
now on; but she is to deliver to you a carbon copy of every letter she
writes for Stolz.And I want those copies on my desk every morning
when I come down.Hood," he continued, abruptly turning the
conversation, "what have you dug up about Ketchim's new company?""Very little, sir," replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment."His
lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise enough not to talk.I called on him yesterday afternoon to have a little chat about the
old Molino company, representing that I was speaking for certain
stockholders.But he told me to bring the stockholders in and he would
talk with them personally."Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly."Is that the sort
of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary?""Hood, I'm ashamed of you!""I can't blame you; I am ashamed of myself," replied the lawyer."Well," continued Ames good-naturedly, "leave Ketchim to me.I've got
three men now buying small amounts of stock in his various companies.I'll call for receiverships pretty soon, and we will see this time
that he doesn't refund the money.Now about other matters: the Albany
post trolley deal is to go through.Work up
the details and let me have them at once.Have you got the senate bill
drawn for Gossitch?"As it stands now, the repealing
section gives any city the right to grant saloon licenses of
indefinite length, instead of for one year."We want the bill so drawn that it will become
practically impossible to revoke a license.""As it now reads," said Hood, "it makes a saloon license assignable.That creates a property right that can hardly be revoked.""As I figure, it will create a value of some
twenty millions for those who own saloons in New York.And if the United States ever reaches the point
where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe them out, it
will face a very handsome little expenditure."Ames, a very large part of the stock of American brewing
companies is owned in Europe.How are you--"

"Nominally, it is.But for two years, and more, I have been quietly
gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and to-day I have some ten
millions in my own control, from actual purchases, options, and so
forth.I'm going to organize a holding company, when the time arrives,
and I figure that within the next year or so we will practically
control the production of beer and spirituous liquors in the United
States and Europe.The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.""It will be a pleasure to undertake it," replied Hood with animation.Ames, I got in touch with Senator Mall last evening
at the club, and he assures me that the senate committee have so
changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on cotton products that the
clause you wish retained will be continued with its meaning unaltered.In fact, the discrimination which the hosiery interests desire will be
fully observed.Your suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per
cent on hose valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is
exceptionally clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less
than that value.""Triumphant Republicanism," he commented."And
right in the face of the President's message.Wire Mall that I will be
in Washington Thursday evening to advise with him further about it.Hood, we've got a fight on in regard to
the President's idea of granting permission in private suits to use
judgments and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations.And the
regulation of security issues of railroads--preposterous!If Mall and Gossitch and Wells don't oppose
that in the Senate, I'll see that they are up before the lunacy
commission--and I have some influence with that body!""There is nothing to fear, I think," replied Hood reassuringly.John went back to the kitchen."An
important piece of business legislation like that will hardly go
through this session.And then we will have time to prepare to
frustrate it.The suggestion to place the New York Stock Exchange
under government supervision is a much more serious matter, I think.""See here, Hood," said Ames, leaning forward and laying a hand upon
that gentleman's knee, "when that happens, we'll have either a
Socialist president or a Catholic in the White House, with Rome
twitching the string.Then I shall move to my Venezuelan estates, take
the vow of poverty, and turn monk.""Which reminds me again that by your continued relations with Rome you
are doing much to promote just that state of affairs," returned the
lawyer sententiously."But I find the Catholic Church
convenient--indeed, necessary--for the promotion of certain plans.But I shall
abruptly sever my relations with that institution some day--when I am
through with it.At present I am milking the Church to the extent of a
brimming pail every year; and as long as the udder is full and
accessible I shall continue to tap it.I tapped the Presbyterian
Church, through Borwell, last year, if you remember."Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment with the
morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written to letters of
such nature as he could attend to without suggestions from his chief."By the way," remarked Hood when he saw the letters, "I had word from
Collins this morning that he had secured a signed statement from that
fellow Marcus, who was crushed in the Avon mills yesterday.Marcus
accepted the medical services of our physicians, and died in our
hospital.Just before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of
one hundred dollars.Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand."That reminds me," said Ames, looking up from his mail; "we are going
to close the mills earlier this year on account of the cotton
shortage.""Four thousand hands idle for three months, I suppose.we just escaped disaster last year, you remember.""It will be more than three months this time," commented Ames with a
knowing look.Then--"Hood, I verily believe you are a coward."Ames," replied the latter slowly, "I certainly would
hesitate to do some of the things you do.Yet you seem to get away
with them.""Perk up, Hood," laughed Ames."I've got real work for you as soon as
I get control of C. and R. I'm going to put you in as president, at a
salary of one hundred thousand per annum.Then you are going to buy
the road for me for about two million dollars, and I'll reorganize and
sell to the stockholders for five millions, still retaining control.The road is only a scrap heap, but its control is the first step
toward the amalgamation of the trolley interests of New England.Laws
are going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.It's up to you to get around the
Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you can, and buttress this
little monopoly against competition and reform-infected legislatures."We'll send Crabbe to the Senate," Ames coolly replied."You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the people, Mr.The people are New York City, Buffalo, and
Albany.And Tammany at present is in my pocket.Buffalo and Albany can be swept by the Catholic vote.And I have that
in the upper right hand drawer of my private file.The 'people' will
therefore elect to the Senate the man I choose.In fact, I prefer
direct election of senators over the former method, for the people are
greater fools _en masse_ than any State Legislature that ever
assembled."He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and glanced
through it."Protests against the way
you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light injunction bill.I really didn't think it was in you."said Hood, puffing a little with
pride.But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped out the
whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now get from my
shacks down there.Now next year we will be better prepared to fight
the bill.The press will be with us then--a little cheaper and a
trifle more degraded than it is to-day."Ames read it and handed
it to his lawyer."The _Proteus_ has reached the African Gold Coast at
last," he said.Then he threw back his head and laughed heartily."Do
you know, Hood, the _Proteus_ carried two missionaries, sent to the
frizzle-topped Zulus by Borwell and his outfit.Deutsch and Company
cable that they have arrived.""But," said Hood in some perplexity, "the cargo of the _Proteus_ was
rum!""Just so," roared Ames; "that's where the joke comes in.I make it a
point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary to a foreign
field shall also carry a cargo of rum.The combination is one that the
Zulu finds simply irresistible!""So," commented Hood, "the Church goes down to Egypt for help!""I carry the missionaries free on my rum
boats.Great saving to the Board of Foreign Missions, you know."Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration of his
cunning."And did you likewise send missionaries to China with your
opium cargoes?""I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong on a boat
loaded to the rails with opium.We had insisted on his taking a needed
vacation, and so packed him off to Europe.In Bombay I cabled him to
take the _Crotus_ to Hongkong, transportation free.That was my last
consignment of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen
upon our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.I
had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India, and I'd
have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for the pressure of
public sentiment.However, we're going to educate John Chinaman to
substitute whiskey for opium.But now," glancing at the great electric
wall clock, "I've wasted enough time with you.By the way, do you know
why this Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?""No," replied Hood, standing in anticipation."Thirty thousand chests of opium," returned Ames laconically."Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of Shanghai and
Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the opium.That necessitated a
few plain words from me to the President, and a quick trip from
Washington to London afterwards to interview his most Christian
British Majesty.A very pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very!Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration, and left the
room."Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant hour,"
commanded Ames."Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, of Cartagena, and
ask him if an American mining company is registered there under the
name of Simiti Development Company, and what properties they have and
where located.Tell him to cable reply, and follow with detailed
letter."He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes."The Congregation of
the Sacred Index has laid the ban on--what's the name of the book?"He
drew out a card-index drawer and selected a card, which he tossed to
the secretary.He seemed to
muse a while, then went on slowly."Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in
New York.Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children's Bureau
must not be taken from the table.Wire the Sequana Coal
Company that I want their report to-morrow, without fail.Wire
Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners' Union I have nothing to
discuss with them.As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett the chief
of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the captain of his force of
brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose knowledge of the market and
whose ability in the matter of stock trading was almost uncanny."What's your selection for to-day, Hodson?"asked Ames, as the man
entered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them
hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his
approval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he
wished to trade that morning."What's your reason for thinking I ought
to buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied
Hodson.Ames studied the broker's face a moment.Then his own brightened, as
he began to divine the man's reason.he ejaculated, "you
think there's quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames
quickly.Then--"I'm going to attend a meeting of the Council of
American Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside
the door."Ames concluded, "I guess that's all.I'm at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock
Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector's at twelve sharp, returning
here immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various
commissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning's quota of letters
and messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the
telephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly
dictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want
to see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,
"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers' Union called at the
earliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the
night with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain
McCall.Here is a bundle of
requests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,
and various homes.'Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go
over my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once
to foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim
does his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank
its note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had
completed the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous
mixture of hypocrisy and greed.I've thrown another hook into him
now."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his
elevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the
directors' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his
associates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the
meeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then
Ames announced:

"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty
millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take
them at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and
the bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold
at a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred
thousand.Now let me suggest that the
psychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a
dollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until
somebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the
number of those who covet the article and scramble for it will
increase proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,
"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the
President in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next
Thursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we
had better give him a little lesson to take out of office with
him--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our
bank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his
luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the
private interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then
followed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and
monthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,
financial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further
discussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of
cable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,
to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,
decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning
until, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private
elevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the
superenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,
and his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless
endeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can
but point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting
his already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a
fortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and
which Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the
fortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but
continually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,
amassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire
with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven
hastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited
as his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed
himself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and
spend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently
on the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well
beyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of
dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite
Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove
their doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13


The _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,
and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark
waters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the
deep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a
spirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a
channel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off
on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to
his fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the
crackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible
hands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were
borne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time
to time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut
glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent
of white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the
movements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn't get results that are in any way commensurate with its
investment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and
cents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I
take off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in
talking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just
what interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was
clearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the
cigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing
over his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes
ever foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable
Klondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I'd
consider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you
do not know your Bible."I don't suppose I ever in my life read a whole
chapter in the book.I can't swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we
know and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any
use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,
tangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant
churches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many
interpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently
interested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when
hard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to
offer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of
the thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn't know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I
drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and
go away with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.From a
business point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about
twenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of
sleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and
seventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your
ceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering
flocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he
said with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude
toward us.We are really more spiritual--"

Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your
Church as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary
and merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the
same business, that of making money!And I'd like to borrow some of
your methods.Only, you've got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have
to hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that
might end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful
friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay
for these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their
like."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he
said, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are
grown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost
me about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door
in New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot
where such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling
champagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"
replied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And
does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and
Ceylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I'm now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without
doubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it
never gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.John went to the office.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
among the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in
pitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had
betrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender
girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the
sharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to
a young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,
leaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl
looked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his
coat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin
and worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl
turned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into
the old man's wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a
comprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek
nor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of
defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl's
right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about
her feet.She stooped and
took up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no
comment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk
walking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running
rapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother
dear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager
eyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take
what I wish.Hitt's coming to call to-night and bring a
friend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then
she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in
her eyes and said, "Don't you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I'm afraid it wouldn't look well," he said."And, besides, I don't dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien's
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it
to-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous
embrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,
very mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of
both the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and
looking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock
severity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in
the waiting lap, "he told, didn't he?Can't I ever trust you with a
secret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged
this had I not seen in the incident something more than mere
chance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a
stupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw
a need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another's
good."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,
dearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast
her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,
wondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared
Carmen, rising.And she departed for the
kitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is
guiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a
manifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,
unasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no
miracle, no luck about it.It was--it
was--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if
we only knew--"

"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is
but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to
comprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to
that end I have been formulating a great plan.That's why I've asked
Hitt to come here to-night.Remember, my
dear friend, we are true searchers; and 'all things work together for
good to them that love God.'Our love of truth and real good is so
great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is
_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *

For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this
lowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the
tired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those
mental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim
and a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to
a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even
Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his
relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But
when he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were
set forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl's parentage
and of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to
social heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to
the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this
tale, which even the girl could not refute?He had
sailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was
cringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him
bail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to
La Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy
hands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,
perhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor
in the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she
told a straightforward story, could not say positively that the
published statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew
it, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days
immediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions
and leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that
browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of
her relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to
England, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized
mother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames's lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,
and laid it before the judge who fed from his master's hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the
dry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen
and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who
had sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold
millions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it
in his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious
dame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle
machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example
to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,
and rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living
death in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and
concentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone
stood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the
girl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at
drastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned
its full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood
at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the
social set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud
of bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and
they made the most of it.As a result, several of them found
themselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was
confronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the
latter's word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of
maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he
knew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk
and plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant
remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and
withdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the
country, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances
necessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers
strove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to
Ames.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,
who placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little
house, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed
thither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face.Haynerd sprang
to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.As he did so, the
screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen Ames and two of her young
companions bent their curious gaze in upon them.Absorbed in their
earnest conversation, Carmen and Haynerd had not heard the approach of
the young ladies, who were on a tour of inspection of the house before
supper."Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames," explained Haynerd, hastily
answering the unspoken question, while he made a courteous bow.she cried, instantly
recognizing Carmen, and drawing back.asked one of the young ladies, as her eyes roved
over Carmen's tense, motionless figure.cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at Carmen, while
her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched."When the front door
is closed against you, you sneak in through the back door!Leave this
house, instantly, or I shall have you thrown into the street!""She is a low, <DW64> wench!"She foisted herself upon society, and was discovered
and kicked out!Her father is a dirty <DW64> priest, and her mother a
low--"

Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his hand over her
mouth."Hush, for God's sake, Miss Ames!"Then, to her companions,
"Take her away!"But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation, had come up
and interposed."I can not put them out if they have his
permission to remain," he explained to the angry Kathleen.In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense and quiet,
Ames himself appeared.turning inquiringly to Haynerd.Her article in last week's Social Era was a corker.But,"
staring from Kathleen to the others, "what's the row?""I want that creature put out of the house!"demanded Kathleen,
trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen."Tut, tut," returned Ames easily."She's on business, and has my
permission to remain.that's a good joke," winking at
Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh."You put one over on us there,
old man!"Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were streaming down
Kathleen's face."If she remains, I shall go--I shall leave the
house--I will not stay under the same roof with the lewd creature!""Very well, then, run along," said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about."I will settle this
without your assistance."Then he motioned to the house detectives to
depart, and turned to Haynerd and Carmen."Come in here," he said,
leading the way to the little waiting room, and opening the door.but you belong down stairs with the rest," he ejaculated as he
faced Carmen, standing before him pale but unafraid."There isn't one
down there who is in your class!"he exclaimed, placing his hands upon
her shoulders and looking down into her beautiful face."And," he
continued with sudden determination, "I am going to take you down, and
you will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!"A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames's face."You mean Congressman--"

Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen and her
companion.Ames's expression
of surprise gave place to one dark and menacing."You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales and I--"

"Yes," returned Carmen calmly.Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon the slender
girl."You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars are just a
loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren't you?""You
will not ruin his life, and the lives of his wife and babies, will
you?You would never be happy, you know, if you did."Her voice was as
quiet as the morning breeze."You come into my house to play spy, eh?And
if I had not caught you when I did you would have written another
interesting article for the Social Era, wouldn't you?I'll
break you, Haynerd, and your infernal sheet into a million pieces if
you dare print any such rot as this!And as for you, young lady--"

"You can do nothing to me, Mr.Ames; and you don't really want to,"
said Carmen quickly."My reputation, you know--that is, the one which
you people have given me--is just as black as it could be, isn't it?"It doesn't really make any
difference to you, Mr.Ames," she said, "whether the cotton schedule
is passed or not.You still have your millions--oh, so much more
than you will ever know what to do with!Wales, he has his
wife and his babies and his good reputation--would you rob him of
those priceless treasures, just to make a few dollars more for
yourself?--dollars that you can't spend, and that you won't let
others have?"During the girl's quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.When
she concluded he turned to Haynerd."Miss Carmen can step out into the
balcony.You and I will arrange this matter together," he said."Now," said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, "what's your
price?"Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between the two men.she cried, her eyes flashing as she confronted
Ames.shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely, "I will
crush him like a dirty spider!And you, I'll drag you through the
gutters and make your name a synonym of all that is vile in
womanhood!"Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the signal button.cried the enraged Ames, starting
toward her.The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced him
fearlessly."We _shall_ leave your house, and now, Mr."You and that for which you stand can not touch us!The carnal
mind is back of you!She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a moment, flashing,
sparkling, radiant with a power which he could not comprehend.You are blinded and deceived by human lust and
greed.But the god you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter
and fall upon you.Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream."Carmen and the dazed Haynerd stepped quickly
into it and descended without opposition to the lower floor.A few
moments later they were again in the street and hurrying to the
nearest car line."Girlie," said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his brow, "we're
in for it now--and I shall be crushed!But you--I think your God will
save you.""His arm is not shortened," she murmured, "that
He can not save us both."CHAPTER 5

ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the society columns
of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant depictions of the
magnificent affair.On that same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily
in the office of the Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary's
probable first move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought
out an unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened little
wife of Congressman Wales.Then, her work done, she dismissed the
whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously back to the
University."But," she
reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct and words of the previous
Saturday evening, "he is not ready for it yet.And when he is, I will
go to him.And Kathleen--well, I will help her by seeing only the real
child of God, which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and
jealousy.And that veil, after all, is but a shadow."That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled again
in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.It was their third
meeting, and they had come together reverently to pursue the most
momentous inquiry that has ever stimulated human thought.Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames reception; but
the former, still brooding over the certain consequences of his brush
with Ames, was dejected and distraught.Carmen, leaning upon her
sustaining thought, and conceding no mite of power or intelligence to
evil, glowed like a radiant star.she asked of Haynerd, drawing him to one
side."Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or good?For those thoughts which are real to you
will become outwardly manifested, you know."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture signifying
defeat."And the insults of that arrogant daughter of his--"

"She did not insult me," said Carmen quickly."She could not, for she
doesn't know me.She merely denounced her concept of me, and not my
real self.She vilified what she thought was Carmen Ariza; but it was
only her own thought of me that she insulted.And such
a concept of me as she holds deserves denouncing, doesn't it?""Well, what are we going to do?""We are going to know," she whispered, "that we two with God
constitute an overwhelming majority."She said nothing about her visit
to the Wales home that morning, but pressed his hand, and then went to
take her place at the table, where Father Waite was already rapping
for order."My friends," began that earnest young man, looking lovingly about at
the little group, "as we are gathered here we symbolize that
analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased human mind to discover
the essence of religion.Religion is that which binds us to absolute
truth, and so is truth itself.If there is a God, we believe from our
former investigations that He must be universal mind.This belief
carries with it as necessary corollaries the beliefs that He must be
perfect, eternal, and self-existent.must
then receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that He
has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable."A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul's struggle to grasp
a statement at once so radical and stupendous."True," continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his doubting
friend, "the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced in our
previous meetings must render the God of orthodox theology quite
obsolete.But, as a compensation, it gives to us the most enlarged and
beautiful concept of Him that we have ever had.It ennobles, broadens,
purifies, and elevates our idea of Him.It destroys forever our
belittling view of Him as but a magnified human character, full of
wrath and caprice and angry threats, and delighting in human
ceremonial and religious thaumaturgy.And, most practical of all for
us, it renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution."Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment later the
Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room.All rose and hastened to
welcome him."I--I am sure," began the visitor, looking at Carmen, "that I am not
intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.Miss Carmen,
first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told me this afternoon that
you would probably meet this evening.I--I pondered the matter some
little time--ah, but--well, to make it short, I couldn't keep away
from a gathering so absolutely unique as this--I really couldn't."she exclaimed, her eyes dancing,
"I am glad you came.""And I, too," interposed Haynerd dryly, "for now we have two
theological Philistines."Ah, my friend," replied the doctor, "I am simply an advocate of
religious freedom, not a--"

"And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is but the art
of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?"returned Haynerd with a
laugh."You are a Philistine," he said.Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place beside her at
the table."You--you didn't bring poor Yorick?"she whispered, with a
glint of mischief in her bright eyes."No," laughed the genial visitor, "he's a dead one, you told me.""Yes," replied the girl, "awfully dead!He is an outward manifestation
of dead human beliefs, isn't he?But now listen, Father Waite is going
to speak."After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of the
meeting, and a short resume of their previous deductions, Father Waite
continued the exposition of his subject."The physical universe," he said, "is to human beings a reality.And
yet, according to Spencer's definition of reality, we must admit that
the universe as we see it is quite unreal.For the real is that which
endures.""And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?""The phenomena of the universe, even as
we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.Birth, growth,
maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law for all things
material."But," again urged Haynerd, "matter itself remains, is indestructible.""Our friend, Doctor Morton, will
corroborate my statement, I am sure.""It is quite true," he said in reply.The discovery, in the past few years, of the
tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates and actually
disappears, has revolutionized all physical science and rendered the
world's text books obsolete.""The radium atom, we find, lasts some
seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer.What becomes of it when
it is destroyed?We can only say that it disappears from human
consciousness.""And so you reason that the whole material universe will ultimately
disappear from the human consciousness?""Yes," returned Hitt, "I feel certain of it.Let us consider of what
the universe consists.For many months I have been pondering this
topic incessantly.I find that I can agree, in a measure, with those
scientists who regard the physical universe as composed of only a few
elementary constituents, namely, matter, energy, space, and time--"

"Each one of these elements is mental," interrupted Carmen."And the physical universe, even from the
human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.""No," interposed Father Waite; "we see only our mental concept of a
universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process."But now," resumed Hitt, "to get back to the supposed reality of the
physical universe, let us examine its constituents.First, let us
consider its unity established by the harmonious interplay of the
forces permeating it.This great fact is what led Herbert Spencer to
conclude that the universe could have but one creator, one ruler, and
that polytheism was untenable.""We are quite agreed regarding that," said Father Waite."If the
Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and omnipotent;
hence there can be but one Creator."Would it exist, but as a convenience for the human mind?Is
it not really a creation of that mind?And, lastly, is it not merely a
mental concept?""Our consciousness of time," replied Carmen, "is only our awareness of
a continuous series of mental states.""That classifies it exactly," said Hitt, "and renders it wholly
mental."We are accustomed to say,
loosely, that space is that in which we see things about us.But in
what does the process of seeing consist?What I
really mean is that I am conscious of a chair.The process of seeing,
we are told, is this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and
casts an image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is
thrown upon the ground glass of a camera.Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones--the branching tips of the optic nerve which
project from the retina--are set in motion by the light-waves.This
vibration is in some mysterious manner carried along the optic nerve
to a center in the brain, and--well, then the mind becomes cognizant
of the chair out there, that's all.""Do you mean
to say," she queried, "that, after thousands of years of thought and
investigation, mankind now know nothing more than that about the
process of seeing?""Then all I've got to say," put in Haynerd, "is that the most
remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!""I find it is only the fool who is cocksure," he
replied."Now," said Hitt, resuming the conversation, "let us go a step further
and inquire, first, What is light?since the process of seeing is
absolutely dependent upon it.""Light," offered the doctor, "is vibrations, or wave-motion, so
physicists tell us.""Light, we say, consists of vibrations.Not
vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material, but--well,
just vibrations in the abstract.Now
let us concede that these vibrations in some way get to the brain
center; and then let us ask, Is the mind there, in the brain, awaiting
the arrival of these vibrations to inform it that there is a chair
outside?"Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh."It is too serious for laughter, my friend," said Hitt."For to such
crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries of mankind.""Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief in a
universe of matter without and about us.As a plain statement of fact,
_there is no such thing_.But, I ask again, Is the mind within the
brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it information concerning
the external world?Or does the mind, from some focal point without
the brain, look first at these vibrations, and then translate them
into terms of things without?Do these vibrations in some way suggest
form and color and substance to the waiting mind?Does the mind first
look at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions
regarding material objects?"No," admitted the doctor; "unless we believe that vibrations _per se_
are material.""Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it must depend
upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside world?""And vibrations of minute pieces of flesh, at that!Flesh that
will some day decay and leave the mind helpless!""Why doesn't the mind look directly at
the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of the chair through
vibrations of bits of meat?Or isn't there any chair out there to look
at?""Now you've put your mental finger upon it.And now we are ready to nail to the cross of ignominy one of the
crudest, most insensate beliefs of the human race._The human mind
gets nothing whatsoever from vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye,
nor from any one of the five so-called physical senses!_ The physical
sense-testimony which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the
ears, and the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a
lot of disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred _without any outside
authority whatsoever!ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath."And, further," continued Hitt, "we are forced to admit that all that
the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its own consciousness,
and nothing more.Then, instead of seeing, hearing, and feeling real
material objects outside of ourselves, we are in reality seeing,
hearing, and feeling our own mental concepts of things--in other
words, _our own thoughts of things!"_

A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at the
conclusion of Hitt's words.Then Doctor Morton nodded his acquiescence
in the deduction."And that," he said, "effectually disposes of the
question of space.""There is no space, Doctor," replied Hitt.The human mind sees, hears, and feels nothing but its own
thoughts.These it posits within itself with reference to one another,
and calls the process'seeing material objects in space.'The mind as
little needs a space in which to see things as in which to dream them.I repeat, we do not see external things, or things outside of
ourselves.We see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities."That's why," murmured Carmen, "Jesus said, 'The kingdom of heaven is
within you.'""Did he not call evil, and all that originates
in matter, the lie about God?I tell you,
the existence of a world outside of ourselves, an objective world
composed of matter, is wholly inferred--it is mental visualizing--and
it is unreal, for it is not based upon fact, upon truth!""Then," queried Haynerd, "our supposed 'outer world' is but our
collection of thought-concepts which we hold within us, within our own
consciousness, eh?""We are ready for that again," replied Hitt."We have said that in the
physical universe all is in a state of incessant change.Since the
physical universe is but a mental concept to each one of us, we must
admit that, were the concept based upon truth, it would not change.Our concept of the universe must be without the real causative and
sustaining principle of all reality, else would it not pass away.And
yet, beneath and behind all these changes, _something_ endures.There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence.But none of these things is in any sense
material.The material is the fleeting, human concept, composed of
thought that is _not_ based upon reality.These other things, wholly
mental, or spiritual, if you prefer, are based upon that'something'
which does endure, and which I will call the Causative Principle."I think," interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, "that I can
throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter, if I may so
put it; for even our physical reasoning throws it entirely into the
realm of the mental."The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study.Then he began:

"The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is a subject
of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for human existence
_is_ material."The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the atom.But we
have said little when we have said that.The atom was once defined as
a particle of matter so minute as to admit of no further division.That definition has gone to the rubbish heap, for the atom can now be
torn to pieces.But--and here is the revolutionary fact in modern
physical science--_it is no longer held necessary that matter should
consist of material particles!_ In fact, the great potential discovery
of our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called 'electrons,' and that these electrons are
themselves composed of electric charges.It is without weight, bulk, dimensions, or
tangibility.Well, then, it comes dangerously near being a mental
thing, known to the human mind solely by its manifestations, does it
not?And of course our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is
our comprehension of everything."He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully grasped.Then he
went on:

"Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join together to
form molecules.Why, it is--well, law, if you please.Then, going a step further,
molecules are held together by cohesion to form material objects,
chairs, trees, coal, and the like."But, Doctor--" interrupted Haynerd."Now we
have the very latest word from our physical scientists regarding the
constitution of matter: _it is composed of electric charges, held
together by law._ Again, you may justly ask: Is matter material--or
mental?"He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him."Here," he continued, "I hold a solid, material, lumpy thing,
composed, you will say, of matter.And yet, in essence, and if we can
believe our scientists, this book is composed of billions of electric
charges--invisible things, without form, without weight, without
color, without extension, held together by law, and making up a
material object which has mass, color, weight, and extension.From
millions of things which are invisible and have no size, we get an
object, visible and extended.""Yet, the doctor is giving the very latest
deductions of the great scientists.""But, Doctor," said Father Waite, "the scientists tell us that they
have experimental evidence in support of the theories which you have
stated regarding the composition of matter.Electricity has been
proven granular, or atomic, in structure.And every electrical
charge consists of an exact number of electrical atoms spread out
over the surface of the charged body."Admitted," said Hitt, taking up the challenge."And their very
calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the'materialistic
theory' of matter.You will admit that mathematics is wholly
confined to the realm of mind.It is a strictly mental science, in no
way material.It loses definiteness when 'practically' applied to
material objects.Kant saw this, and declared that a science might be
regarded as further removed from or nearer to perfection in proportion
to the amount of mathematics it contained.Now there has been an
astonishing confirmation of this great truth just lately.At a banquet
given in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible electric waves
was said to be due to the absence of matter.And it was further
stated that _whenever matter had to be taken into consideration there
could be no exact law of action!"That matter admits of no definite laws," replied Hitt."That there
are no real laws of matter.And that definiteness is attained only as
we dematerialize matter itself.""In other words, get into the realm of the mental?"I have said that we do not
receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called material
senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell our own
thoughts--that is, the thoughts which, from some source, come into our
mentalities.Very well, our scientists show us that, as they get
farther away from dense material thoughts, and deal more and more with
those which have less material structure, less material composition,
their laws become more definite, more exact.Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that _only those laws which
have to do with the non-material are perfect_.""And those," said Carmen, "are the laws of mind."And now the history of physical science shows that there has
been a constant deviation from the old so-called fixed 'laws of
matter.'The law of impenetrability has had to go.A great physicist
tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently high speeds, matter has
no such property as impenetrability.The law of indestructibility has had to go.Matter deteriorates and
goes to pieces.The decided
tendency of belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is
composed, and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of matter
accepted to-day are but modifications.That unit element may be the
ether, of course.And the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef, so
believed.But to us, the ether is a mental thing, a theory.But,
granting its existence, _its universal penetrability renders matter,
as we know it, non-existent_.Everything reduces to the ether, in the
final analysis.And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the
ether.""And the ether," supplemented the doctor, "has to be without mass,
invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than steel, and at
the same time some six hundred billion times lighter than air, in
order to fulfill all the requirements made of it and to meet all
conditions.""Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we are going to
continue to explain the phenomena of force on a material basis.""Then," said Carmen, "matter reduces to what it really is, the human
mind's _interpretation_ of substance.""Yes," said Hitt, turning to her; "I think you are right; matter is
the way real substance--let us say, spirit--looks to the human
mentality.It is the way the human mind interprets its ideas of
spirit.In other words, the human mind looks at the material thoughts
and ideas which enter it, and calls them solid substance, occupying
space--calls them matter, with definite laws, and, in certain forms,
containing life and intelligence.""And that has been the terrible
mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one lie, that has caused
us all to miss the mark and come short, far short, of the glory of the
mind that is God._There is the origin of the problem of evil!_"

"Undoubtedly," replied Hitt."For evil is in essence but evil thought.The origin of
all evil is matter itself.And matter, we find, is but a mental
concept, a thing of thought."Well," put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously in his chair,
"let's get to the conclusion of this very learned discussion.I'm a
plain man, and I'd like to know just where we've landed.What have you
said that I can take home with me?The earth still revolves around the
sun, even if it is a mean mud ball.And I can't see that I can get
along with less than three square meals a day.""We have arrived," replied Hitt gravely, "at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves, namely,
that _things are not what they seem_.In other words, all things
material seem to reduce to vibrations in and of the ether; the basis
of all materiality is energy, motion, activity--mental things.All the
elements of matter seem to be but modifications of one all-pervading
element.That element is probably the ether, often called the'mother
of matter.'The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are
not elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether.The so-called rare elements are
rare only because their lives are short.They disintegrate rapidly and
change into other forms of the universal element--or disappear.'Atoms
are but fleeting phases of matter,' we are told.They are by no means
eternal, even though they may endure for millions of years.""A great scientist of our own day," Hitt continued, "has said that
'the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in some way.'Simply that 'visible matter and invisible ether are
one and the same thing.'But to the five so-called physical senses the
ether is utterly incomprehensible.So, then, matter is wholly
incomprehensible to the five physical senses.What is it, then, that
we call matter?It can be nothing more than the human mind's
interpretation of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent
_something_, a something which represents substance to it.""Let me add a further quotation from the great physical scientist to
whom you have referred," said the doctor."He has said that the ether
is _not_ matter, but that it is material.And further, that we can not
deny that the ether may have some mental and spiritual functions to
subserve in some other order of existence, as matter has in this.It
is wholly unrelated to any of our senses.The sense of sight takes
cognizance of it, but only in a very indirect and not easily
recognized way.And yet--stupendous conclusion!--_without the ether
there could be no material universe at all_!""In other words," said Hitt, "the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable by the five
physical senses.""Then," concluded Hitt, "the physical senses give us no information
whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.""And so," added Father Waite, "we come back to Carmen's statement,
namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are
mental processes, in no way dependent upon the outer fleshly organs of
sense--"

"Nonsense!""Why is it, then, that if the eyes
are destroyed we do not see?""Simply, my friend, because of human belief," replied Hitt."The human
mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence upon beliefs
in the reality of matter, and beliefs in its dependence upon material
modes for sight, hearing, touch, and so on.It is because of its
erroneous beliefs that the human mind is to-day enslaved by matter,
and dependent upon it for its very sense of existence.The human mind
has made its sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of
flesh, the eye.As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the
human mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects.But let that fleshly eye
be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief of dependence upon
the material eye externalized as blindness.When the fleshly eye is
gone the mind declares that it can no longer see.And what it declares
as truth, as fact, becomes externalized to it.I repeat, the human
mind sees and hears only its thoughts, its beliefs.And holding to
these beliefs, and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them
externalized in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe.And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show that
the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through the five
physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very existence, the
ether.it is but a theory which we find necessary
for any intelligible explanation of the farce of human existence on a
material basis."retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression to his
protest by means of emphatic gestures.You
tell me that the existence of things demands a creator, and I admit
it, for there can be no effect without a cause.Then you say that the
universe is infinite; and I admit that, too, for the science of
astronomy finds no limits to space, and no space unoccupied.You say
that the unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator.Moreover, to create an infinite universe there must needs
be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one who is omnipotent.Further, I can see how that creator must be
mind--infinite mind.And I can see why that mind must be absolutely
perfect, with no intelligence of evil whatsoever, else would it be a
house divided against itself.Now I admit that the universe must be the manifestation, the
expression, of that infinite creative mind.But--and here's the
sticking point--the universe is both good and evil!Hence, the mind
which it manifests is likewise both good and evil--and the whole
pretty theory blows up!"He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality to a
perplexing question.All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed the
little group."It is not surprising," she said, smiling at the confused Haynerd,
"that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach God through human
reasoning--spirit through matter.You have taken the unreal, and,
through it, have sought to reach back to the real.""Well," interrupted Haynerd testily, "kindly explain the difference.""Then, first," replied Carmen, "let us adopt some common meeting
ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from which we can
rise.Are you all agreed that, in our every-day life, everything is
mental?--every action?--every object?--and that, as the philosopher
Mill said, 'Everything is a feeling of which the mind is conscious'?Let me illustrate my meaning," she continued, noting Haynerd's rising
protest."I see this book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table.No; I have been conscious of thoughts which
I call a book, nothing more.A real material book did not get into my
mind; but _thoughts_ of a book did.And the activity of such thought
resulted in a state of consciousness--for consciousness is mental
activity, the activity of thought.Remember that, even according to
your great physical scientists, this book is composed of millions of
charges of electricity, or electrons, moving at a tremendously high
rate of speed.And yet, regardless of its composition, I am conscious
only of my thoughts of the book.It is but my thoughts that I see,
after all."She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced."Very well," she said, continuing; "so it is with the sense of touch;
I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I saw; I was
conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.So with sound;
when I let the book drop, I was conscious of my thought of sound.If
the book had been dropped in a vacuum I should not have been conscious
of a thought of sound--why?Hitt has told us, the
human mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.And
yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall."Yes," replied Haynerd; "now that you've called my attention to it.""You hear it when your thought is
directed to it.And yet the air was vibrating all the time, and, if
hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you should have heard it
incessantly when you were not thinking of it, as well as you hear it
now when you are thinking of it."Well, perhaps so," assented Haynerd with some reluctance."We hear, see, and feel," continued the girl, "when our thought is
directed to these processes.And the processes are wholly mental--they
take place within our mentalities--and it is there, within our minds,
that we see, hear, and feel _all_ things.And it is there, within our
minds, that the universe exists for us.It is there that we hold our
world, our fleshly bodies, everything that we call material._The
universe that we think we see all about us consists of the mental
concepts, made up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities_."Carmen proceeded with the
exposition of her theme."Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?They are real to us, at any rate,
are they not?And if they are thoughts of pain and suffering and
death, they are terribly real to us.But let us see, now that we can
reason from the basis of the mental nature of all things.We have
agreed that the creative principle is mind, and we call it God.This
infinite mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas.Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind!You express yourself in your ideas
and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.But the
infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite number and variety of
ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect, eternal, good, without any
elements or seeds of decay or discord.And the incessant expression of
the creative mind in and through its numberless ideas constitutes the
never-ending process of creation.""Let me add here," interrupted Hitt, "that the Bible states that God
created the heavens and earth in seven days.But numbers, we must
remember, were mystical things to the ancient Hebrews, and were
largely used symbolically.The number seven, for example, was used to
express wholeness, completeness.So we must remember that its use in
Genesis has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological
interpretation into seven solar days.As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can never
cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation or
unfoldment of infinite mind's ideas.""And infinite mind," continued Carmen, "requires infinite time in
which to completely express itself.So time ceases to be, and we find
that all real things exist now, in an endless present.Now, the ideas
of infinite mind range throughout the realm of infinity, but the
greatest idea that the creative mind can have is the idea of itself.That idea is the image and likeness of the infinite creative mind.It
is the perfect reflection of that mind--its perfect expression.That
idea is what the man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of
man."That's quite a different proposition from
the mud-men that I do business with daily."If they were real," said Carmen, "they would have to be children of
God.But then they would not be'mud-men.'Now I have just spoken of
the real, the spiritual creation.That is the creation mentioned in
the first chapter of Genesis, where all was created--revealed,
unfolded--by God, and He saw that it was perfect, good.'In the
beginning,' says the commentator.That is, 'To begin with--God.'Everything begins with God in the realm of the real.And the creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative
principle, eternal and good.""But," persisted Haynerd, "how about the material man?""Having created all things spiritually," continued the girl, "was it
necessary that the creative mind should repeat its work, do it over
again, and produce the man of dust described in the second chapter of
Genesis?Is that second account of the creation an inspiration of
truth--or a human comment?""Call it what you will," said the cynical Haynerd; "the fact remains
that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned with.""Both of your premises are wholly incorrect," returned the girl
gently."He does _not_ exist, excepting in human, mortal thought.He
is a product of only such thought.He and his material universe are
seen and dealt with only in such thought.And such thought is the
direct antithesis of God's thought.It is
the supposition, the lie, the mist that went up and darkened the
earth.""Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue, the shadowy
opposite which seems to counterfeit the real, spiritual man and claim
all his attributes.He is not a compound of mind and matter, for we
have seen that all things are mental, even matter itself.He is a sort
of mentality, a counterfeit of real mind.His body and his universe
are in himself.And, like all that is unreal, he is transient,
passing, ephemeral, mortal.""No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition.If so, then not even truth can destroy it.No, the human mind is the
'old man' of Paul.He is to be put off by knowing his nothingness, and
by knowing the unreality of his supposed material environment and
universe.As he goes out of consciousness, the real man, the idea of
God, perfect, harmonious, and eternal, comes in.""And there," said Father Waite impressively, "you have the whole
scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man Jesus.""There is no doubt of it," added Hitt.how
futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the whole
theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made dogmas,
their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden heaven.Oh, how
belittling now appear their concepts of God--a God who can damn
unbaptised infants, who can predestine his children to eternal sorrow,
who creates and then curses his handiwork!Do you wonder that sin,
sorrow, and death remain among us while such awful beliefs hold sway
over the human mind?Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments, deep in
thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.It seems--it seems as if a curtain had been raised suddenly.And what I
see beyond is--"

Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about him."That
infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted by human
beings, is back of you," she whispered."But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount of reasoning would
have convinced me."And, bowing to the little group, he went out.said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor."If these things are true," he made answer
slowly, "then I shall have to recast my entire mentality, my whole
basis of thinking.""It is just what you _must_ do, Doctor, if you would work out your
salvation," said Carmen."Jesus said we must repent if we would be
saved.Repentance--the Greek _metanoia_--means a complete and radical
change of thought.""But--do you mean to say that the whole world has been mistaken?That
the entire human race has been deceived for ages?""Why," said Hitt, "it was only in our own day, comparatively speaking,
that the human race was undeceived in regard to the world being round.And there are thousands of human beings to-day who still believe in
witchcraft, and who worship the sun and moon, and whose lives are
wholly under the spell of superstition.Human character, a great
scientist tells us, has not changed since history began.""But we can't revamp our thought-processes!""Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering, sorrowing,
and dying, over and over and over again, until we decide that we can
do so," said Hitt.The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of unbounded love
which she gave without stint to a sin-weary world."I--I'll come again," he said."Yes," said Carmen, rising and coming around to him."And," in a
whisper, "bring Pat."CHAPTER 6


The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance every
Saturday morning, that its fashionable clientele might appease their
jaded appetites on the Sabbath day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum.But, though the Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the
following Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
a report of the notable affair.Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed before him only the
scene in the little waiting room, and he could write of nothing else.He found himself still dwelling upon the awful contrast between the
slender wisp of a girl and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood
before him; and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in
consequence drenched his skin with cold perspiration.On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked Carmen to
write during the week, as her report of the brilliant event.He had
read it through three times, and each time had read into it a new
meaning.Not that it ridiculed or condemned--at
least, not openly--but because every one of its crisp comments
admitted of an interpretation which revealed the hidden depths of the
social system, and its gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of
a powerful searchlight.It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition.Rather, it was an interpretation, and a suggestion.It was, too, a
prediction; but not a curse.The girl loved those about whom she
wrote.And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn that her love
stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but penetrated until it
rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.And then Haynerd saw that
the essay was, in substance, a social clinic, to which all searchers
after truth were bidden, that they might learn a great lesson from her
skillful dissection of the human mind, and her keen analysis of its
constituent thought.As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was brought
in.He glanced up, and then started to his feet.The letters spread
over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and the puffing mail carrier
declared that he had made a special trip with them alone.Haynerd
began to tear them open, one after another.Then he called the office
boy, and set him at the task.There were more than five hundred of
them, and each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd's mind.He rose and went
to the card-index to consult his subscription list.He
stood confusedly for a moment, then hastened to the window that looked
out upon a fire-escape.He turned
and rushed to the vault, which, reflecting his own habitual
carelessness, was never locked.His ledgers and account books were not
there.Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until the office
boy tallied nearly eight hundred.Then Haynerd, as if rousing from a
dream, reached for the telephone and summoned Hitt to his rescue.Its mailing list had contained some
fifteen hundred names.The subscription price was twelve dollars a
year--and never, to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his
ultra-rich patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears.Haynerd saw
it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before the summer
sun.Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with him, and
Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames bribe, and the
encounter following."But," he cried, "can Ames kill my entire
subscription list, and in a single week?""Easily," replied Hitt, "and in any one of several ways.Apparently he
had caused your subscription list and books to be stolen.Or, rather, Ames has lifted it bodily from the sky."Carmen
and I saw him bribe Wales!"Forget all that," he said, laying a hand on the excited
man's arm."Remember, that Wales would never dare breathe a word of
it; Carmen has no reputation or standing whatsoever now in this city;
and Ames would make out a case of blackmail against you so quickly
that it would sweep you right into the Tombs.And first, let
us get the girl herself down here."He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at her home.Then, having located her, he plunged into a study of the situation
with the distracted publisher."Here I waste my
evenings in learned philosophical discussions with you people, and
meantime, while we're figuring out that there is no evil, that
monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and strangles me!Fine
practical discussions we've been having, ain't they?I tell you, I'm
through with 'em!"He brought his fist down upon the desk with a
crash."Ned," said Hitt, "you're a fool."Here I had a nice, clean
business, no work, good pay--and, just because I associated with you
and that girl, the whole damn thing goes up the flue!Pays to be good,
doesn't it?"H'm; well, Ned, you're not only a fool, but a blooming idiot,"
replied Hitt calmly."And if you run out of
epithets, I'll supply a few!I'm a--"

The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea breeze, and
panting with her haste."Do you know," she began eagerly, "two men
followed me all the way down from the University!They watched me
come in here, and--but, what is wrong with you two?"She stopped and
looked inquiringly from one to the other."Well," began Hitt hesitatingly, "we were reflecting--"

"Reflecting?"We were just holding a wake, that's all," muttered Haynerd.Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.Then he
briefly related the events which had led to her being summoned."And
now," he concluded, "the question is, does Wales know that you and Ned
saw Ames try to bribe him?""I did--last Monday morning, early," answered the wondering girl.ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt and waving
his arms about."What do you--"

"Hold your tongue, Ned!"Then, to Carmen, "Why did
you tell her?""Why--to save her, and her husband, and babies!"But, to save them, you have ruined Ned," pursued Hitt.The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his chair, the
picture of despair.It was the first time
she had used this name in addressing him.And if you have been pushed out of this business, it is because
it isn't fit for you, and because you've been awakened.You are for
higher, better things than the publishing of such a magazine as the
Social Era.I knew you just couldn't stay at this work.You have got
to go up--"

"Eh!"Haynerd had roused out of his torpor.Yes, I've gone up,
nicely!And I was making ten thousand dollars a year out of it!"I wasn't speaking of money," she said."When I talk, it's in dollars and
cents!""And that's why your talk is mostly nonsense," put in Hitt."The
girl's right, I guess.You've stagnated here long enough, Ned.There's
no such thing as standing still."You now have a grand opportunity," said Carmen, taking his hand."Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove that there
is no evil," she said."Listen; you have been trained as a publisher.Very well, the world is waiting for the right kind of publications.Oh, I've seen it for a long, long time.The demand is simply
tremendous.Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt."What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?""Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him print real
news; let him work, not for rich people's money, but for all people.Why, the press is the greatest educator in the world!But, oh, how it
has been abused!Now let him come out boldly and stand for clean
journalism.Let him find his own life, his own good, in service for
others.""But, Carmen," protested Hitt, "do the people want clean journalism?"It could, if it had the right thought back of it," returned the
confident girl.Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence.But Hitt pondered the
girl's words for some moments.She was not the first nor the only one
who had voiced such sentiments.He himself had even dared to hold the
same thoughts, and to read in them a leading that came not from
material ambitions.Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.Hitt's eyes widened with his expanding
thought."Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to sell," he
continued, speaking rapidly."It's a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country circulation;
has no subscription list," commented Haynerd, with a cynical shrug of
his shoulders.The abruptness of the strange, apparently irrelevant question
startled the girl."Why," she replied slowly, "as old as--as God."And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?"Hitt then turned to
Haynerd."How much money can you scrape together, if you sell this lot
of junk?"he asked, sweeping the place with a glance."Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account, bonds, and
everything, I suppose," replied Haynerd mechanically."Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express.I'm not a rich man, as
wealth is estimated to-day, but--well, oil is still flowing down in
Ohio.It isn't the money--it's--it's what's back of the cash."Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm."We can do it," she
whispered.Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet."I've pondered and studied this scheme for a year,
but I've only to-day seen the right help.That is your tremendous,
driving thought," he said, turning to Carmen."That thought is a
spiritual dynamite, that will blast its way through every material
obstacle!Ned," seizing Haynerd by the shoulder and shaking him out of
his chair, "rouse up!Now I'll 'phone Carlson
right away and make an appointment to talk business with him.Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the light.But then,
as a comprehension of Hitt's plan dawned upon his waking thought, he
straightened up.The clientele of the Express will not be made up
of his puppets!"But--your University work, Hitt?""I was only biding my time," she replied gently.Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd's cheeks, as the tension in
his nerves slackened.He rose and seized the hands of his two friends."Hitt," he said, in a choking voice, "I--I said I was a fool.The real man has waked up, and--well, what are you
standing there for, you great idiot?*       *       *       *       *

Again that evening the little group sat about the table in the dining
room of the Beaubien cottage.But only the three most directly
concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the owner of the Express had
received that afternoon an offer for the purchase of his newspaper,
and that he had been given twenty-four hours in which to accept it.Doctor Morton was again present; and beside him sat his lifelong
friend and jousting-mate, the very Reverend Patterson Moore.Hitt
took the floor, and began speaking low and earnestly."We must remember," he said, "in conjunction with what we have deduced
regarding the infinite creative mind and its manifestations, that we
mortals in our daily mundane existence deal only and always with
phenomena, with appearances, with effects, and never with ultimate
causes.And so all our material knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only.Of the ultimate essence of things, the human mind
knows nothing.A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute truth we
can not affirm.And yet--mark this well--as Spencer says, 'Every one
of the arguments by which the relativity of our knowledge is
demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive existence of something
beyond the relative.'""It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called the 'Theory
of suppositional opposites'", replied Hitt."It means that to every
reality there is the corresponding unreality.For every truth there
may be postulated the supposition.We can not, as the great
philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of
appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of
which they are appearances.He further amplifies this by saying that
'every positive notion--the concept of a thing by what it is--suggests
a negative notion--the concept of a thing by what it is not.But,
though these mutually suggest each other, _the positive alone is
real_.'For, interpreted, it means: we
must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human sense, in order
to see that which is real."exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to note the
effect of the speaker's words on the others.But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added: "Did not Jesus
say that we must deny ourselves?Why, the self that
appears to us, the matter-man, the dust-man, the man of the second
chapter of Genesis.We must deny his reality, and know that he is
nothing but a mental concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out
of dust-thought."Undoubtedly correct," said Hitt, turning to Carmen."But, before we
consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us sum up the
conclusions of philosophy.To begin with, then, there is a First
Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of very necessity perfect.That
Cause lies back of all the phenomena of life; and, because of its real
existence, there arises the suppositional existence of its opposite,
its negative, so to speak, which is unreal.The phenomena of human
existence have to do _only_ with the suppositional existence of the
great First Cause's opposite.They are a reflection of that
supposition.Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more real
substance than have shadows._We, as mortals, know but the shadowy,
phenomenal existence._ _We do not know reality._ _Therefore, our
knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition._

"Now," he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of protest on
Reverend Moore's face, "we are more or less familiar with a phenomenal
existence, with appearances, with effects; and our knowledge of these
is entirely mental.These thoughts, such
as feeling, seeing, hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the
five physical senses.This is what Ruskin calls the 'pathetic
fallacy.'And because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent
upon these senses--in belief.Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.The truth of the multiplication table will endure
eternally."No," admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others."And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and touch,"
went on Hitt, "we appear to see solidity and hardness, and we conceive
as real objects what are only the mental signs or indications of
objects.Remember, matter does not and can not get into the mind.Only
thoughts and ideas enter our mentalities.We see our _thoughts_ of
hardness, solidity, and so on; and these thoughts point to something
that is real.I repeat: _the ideas of the
infinite creative Mind_.The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so
on, which we group together and call material chairs, trees,
mountains, and other objects, are but'relative realities,' pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas and
thoughts."But all seemed absorbed in his
statements.Then he resumed:

"Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a mental
concept, built up out of false thought, points to _mind_ as the real
substance.Our concept of measurable space and distance is the direct
opposite of the great truth that infinite mind is ever-present.Our
concept of time is the opposite of infinity.Age is the opposite of eternity--and the old-age thought
brings extinction.So, _to every reality there is the corresponding
unreality_.If the infinite creative
mind is good--and we saw that by very necessity it _must_ be so--then
evil becomes an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought
which entertains or holds it.If life is real--and infinite mind must
itself be life--then death becomes the opposite unreality.And, as
Jesus said, it can be overcome.But were it real, _no power_, _divine
or human_, _could ever overcome or destroy it_!""Seems to me," remarked Haynerd dryly, "that our study so far simply
goes to show, as Burke puts it, 'what shadows we are and what shadows
we pursue.'""When the world humiliates itself to the point that it
will accept that, my friend," he said, "then it will become receptive
to truth."But now let us go a little further," he went on."The great Lamarck
voiced a mighty fact when he said, 'Function precedes structure.'For
by that we mean that the egg did not produce the bird, but the bird
the egg.The world seems about to pass from the very foolish belief
that physical structure is the cause of life, to the great fact that a
_sense_ of life produces the physical structure.The former crude
belief enslaved man to his body.The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.""You see, Doctor," interrupted Carmen, "the brain which you were
cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick's mind and thought,
but his mind made the brain."The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl."The body," resumed Hitt, "is a manifestation of the human mind's
activity.What constitutes the difference between a bird and a steam
engine?This, in part: the engine is made by human hands from without;
the bird makes itself, that is, its body, from within.But the ignorant human mind--ignorant _per se_--falls
a slave to its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its
physical body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being based on
any real principle, is forced to pass away, having nothing but false
thought to sustain it.""But now," interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing impatient, "just
what is the practical application of all this abstruse reasoning?""The very greatest imaginable, my friend," replied Hitt.And so matter can not become non-existent _unless it
is already nothing_!The world is beginning to recognize the
tremendous fact that from nothing nothing can be made.Very well,
since the law of the conservation of energy seems to be established as
regards energy _in toto_, why, we must conclude that there is no such
thing as _annihilation_.And that means that _there is no such thing
as absolute creation_!The shadow
never was real, and does not exist.And so creation becomes unfolding,
or revelation, or development, of what already exists, and has always
existed, and always will exist.Therefore, if matter, and all it
includes as concomitants, evil, sin, sickness, accident, chance, lack,
and death, is based upon unreal, false thought, then it can all be
removed, put out of consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a
reversal of our accustomed human thought-processes.""And that," said Carmen, "is salvation.It is based on righteousness,
which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts, and thinking truly.""And knowing," added Hitt, "that evil, including matter, is the
suppositional opposite of truth.The doctrine of materialism has been
utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.For physicists
have at last agreed that inertia is the great essential property of
matter.That is, matter is not a cause, but an effect.It does not
operate, but is operated upon.It is not a law-giver, but is subject
to the human mind's so-called laws concerning it.It of itself is
utterly without life or intelligence."Now Spencer said that matter was a
manifestation of an underlying power or force.Physicists tell us that
matter is made of electricity, that it is an electrical phenomenon,
and that the ultimate constituent of matter is the electron.The
electron is said by some to be made up of superimposed layers of
positive and negative electricity, and by others to be made up of only
negative charges.I rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of
only negative electricity it is more truly a negation.Matter is the
_negative_ of real substance.Hence matter is a form of
energy also.But our comprehension of it is _wholly mental_.The only real energy there is or can be is the energy of the
infinite mind we call God.This the human mind copies, or imitates,
by reason of what has been called 'the law of suppositional
opposites,' already dwelt upon at some length.Gravitation is regarded by some physicists as the negative aspect of
radiation-pressure, the latter being the pressure supposed to be
exerted by all material bodies upon one another.The third law of
motion illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action
and reaction are equal and opposite.There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one.The divine
mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human, or mortal, mind.The latter is manifested by the so-called minds which we call mankind.And from these so-called minds issue matter and material forms and
bodies, with their so-called material laws."Yes, the material universe is running down.The
entire human concept is running down.Matter, the human mental
concept, is not eternally permanent.Neither, therefore, are its
concomitants, sin and discord.Matter disintegrates and passes
away--out of human consciousness.The whole material universe--the
so-called mortal-mind concept--is hastening to its death!""But as yet I think you have not given Mr.Haynerd the practical
application which he asks," suggested Father Waite, as Hitt paused
after his long exposition."I am now ready for that," replied Hitt."We have said that the
material is the relative.But,
that being so, we can go a step further and add that human error is
likewise relative.And now--startling fact!--_it is absolutely
impossible to really know error_!""Can you know that two plus two
equals seven?""Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be known definitely
except as it is explained by the principle which governs it.Now what
principle governs an error, whether that error be in music,
mathematics, or life conduct?"And that
is why God--infinite Mind--can not behold evil.And now, friends, I
have come to the conclusion of a long series of deductions.If
infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is, the revealer, of all
that really exists, its suppositional opposite, its negative, must
likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or unfolding, for this
opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative principle.It must
simulate all the powers and attributes of the infinite creative mind.If the creative mind gave rise to a spiritual universe and spiritual
man, by which it expresses itself, then this suppositional opposite
must present its universe and its man, opposite in every particular to
the reality._It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that
we, as mortals, seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as
human beings and the physical universe._ And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought that
comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
activity there causes what we call consciousness or awareness of
things.""Then," said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own thought than to
question the deduction, "what the human consciousness holds as
knowledge is little more than belief and speculation, with no basis of
truth, no underlying principle."And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in discord,
decay, and final dissolution, called death.For this human consciousness
forms its own concept of a fleshly body, and a mind-and-matter man.It
makes the laws which govern its body, and it causes its body to obey
these false laws.Upon the quality of thought entering this human
consciousness depend all the phenomena of earthly life and environment
which the mortal experiences.The human consciousness, in other words,
is a _self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly without any basis
of real principle, but actively engaged in building up mental images,
and forming and maintaining an environment in which it supposes
itself to live_._This false thought in the human consciousness forms
into a false concept of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the
mind-and-matter man, which is called a human being, or a mortal._"

"And there," commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away look, "we have
what Padre Jose so long ago spoke of as the 'externalization of
thought.'It is the same law which Jesus had in mind when he said, 'As
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.'""For we know only what enters our mentalities and
becomes active there.And every thought that does so enter, tends at
once to become externalized.That is, there is at once the tendency
for us to see it visualized in some way, either as material object, or
environment, or on our bodies.And it is the very activity of such
thought that constitutes the human mentality, as I have already
said.""And that thought is continually changing," suggested Father Waite.Its very lack of true principle requires that it should
change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as possible the
real.That accounts for the fleeting character of the whole human
concept of man and the physical universe.The human personality is
never fixed, although the elements of human character remain; that is,
those elements which are essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust,
greed, hatred, and materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages.They will give way only before truth, even as Paul said.But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins its solvent
work there, the work of denying and tearing down the false
thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.""And will truth come through the physical senses?"Their supposed testimony is the material thought which enters
the human mentality and becomes active there, resulting in human
consciousness of both good and evil.And that thought will have to
give way to true thought, before we can begin to put off the 'old man'
and put on the 'new.'Human thoughts, or, as we say, the physical
senses, do not and can not testify of absolute truth.exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up."There goes the Church, and
original sin, and fallen man!""There is no such thing as 'fallen man,' my friend," said Hitt
quietly."The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the reflection,
of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its principle
remains perfect--and that is eternally.He is a product of false, suppositional thought.He did not fall, because he has had no perfection
to lose."Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not wholly
sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could now no longer
withhold his protest."No wonder," he abruptly exclaimed, "that there
are so few deep convictions to-day concerning the great essentials of
Christianity!As I sit here and listen to you belittle God and rend
the great truths of His Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I
am moved by feelings poignantly sorrowful!The Christ has once been
crucified; and will you slay him again?""No," said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, "but we would
resurrect him!Don't you think you have kept him in the tomb long
enough?The Christ-principle is intended for use, not for endless
burial!"My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen Christ!""And
because of centuries of such preaching the world has steadily sunk
from the spiritual to the material, and lip service has taken the
place of that genuine spiritual worship which knows no evil, and
which, because of that practical knowledge, heals the sick and raises
the dead.""No, I state facts," said Carmen."Paul made some mistakes, for he was
consumed with zeal.But he stated truth when he said that the second
coming of Christ would occur when the 'old man' was put off.We have
been discussing the 'old man' to-night, and showing how he may be put
off.Now do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?""I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare my flock
for the world to come," replied the minister with some heat."But I am interested in the eternal present," said the girl, "not in a
suppositional future.'I am that which is, and which was, and which is to come,' says
the infinite, ever-present mind, God!""I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,"
retorted the minister."If what you say is true, and the world should
accept it, all that we have learned in the ages past would be blotted
out, and falsehood would be written across philosophy, science, and
religion.By wafting evil lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the
issue, and extend license to all mankind to indulge it freely.Evil is
an awful, a stupendous fact!And it can not be relegated to the realm
of shadow, as you are trying to do!""You know, Duns Scotus
said: 'Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no
substantial existence.Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence
absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality.'And do you really think he looked upon
evil as a _reality_?""Then, if that is true," said the girl, "I will have to reject him.But come, we are right up to the point of discussing him and his
teachings, and that will be the subject of our next meeting.It is love, you know, that has drawn us all
together."It's an open forum, Moore," said the doctor, patting him on the back."Wisdom isn't going to die with you."I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor," replied the
minister tartly."Well, then, come and correct us when we err.It's your duty to save
us if we're in danger, you know.""And now, Carmen, the piano awaits you.By
the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?""Oh," replied the girl lightly, "he begged me to let him train me for
Grand Opera.""He said I would make a huge fortune," she laughed."I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that my fortune
was now so immense that I couldn't possibly hope to add to it."Hitt," she said, going to him and looking up into his
face, "I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.I couldn't be happy if I made people pay to hear
me sing."With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where she
launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson Moore raise
his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.CHAPTER 7


Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys her instincts.Her life had been one of utter freedom from
dependence upon human judgment.The burden of decision as to the
wisdom of a course of action rested always upon her own thought.Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience.When the day of
judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand, it found her
standing boldly, because her love was made perfect, not through
instinct alone, but through conformity with the certain knowledge that
he who lacks wisdom may find it in the right thought of God and man.And so, when on the next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office
of the Social Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms,
eagerly, and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.Haynerd was a composite picture of doubt
and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.Hitt was serious to the
point of gloom, reflecting in a measure his companion's dismal
forebodings."I was scared to death for fear he wouldn't sell," Haynerd was saying
as the girl entered; "and I was paralyzed whenever I thought that he
would."Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words."Do you know," she
said, "you remind me of Lot's wife.She was told to go ahead, along
the right course.But she looked back--alas for her!Now you two being
started right are looking back; and you are about to turn to salt
tears!"Now listen," she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate; "don't
voice a single fear to me!You couldn't make me believe them true even
if you argued for weeks--and we have no time for such foolishness
now.The first thing that you have got to do, Ned, is to start a
little cemetery.In it you must bury your fears, right away, and
without any mourning.Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don't
ever go near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human mind will
hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new career.Good is
bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now in the business of good.Remember, the first thing the Apostles always did was to be afraid.And they kept Jesus busy pointing out the nothingness of their
fears.""I guess we'll find
ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!""True, humanly speaking," replied the girl, taking a chair beside him."But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling thing I have found in
this great, new country.It is this: you Americans have, oh, so much
animal courage--and so little true moral courage!You know that the
press is one of the most corrupt institutions in America, don't you?Going into thousands of homes every day, it is
a deadlier menace than yellow fever.You know that it is muzzled by
so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.And yet, Ned, despite
your heart-longing, you dare not face the world and stand boldly for
righteousness in the conduct of the Express!"Now," she went on hurriedly, "let me tell you more.While you have
been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.Carlson's decision, I
have been busy.If I had allowed my mentality to become filled with
fear and worry, as you have done, I would have had no room for real,
constructive thought.But I first thanked God for this grand
opportunity to witness to Him; and then I put out every mental
suggestion of failure, of malicious enmity from the world, and from
those who think they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument
about the unpreparedness of the human mind for good.After that I set
out to visit various newspaper offices in the city.I have talked with
four managing and city editors since yesterday noon.I have their
viewpoints now, and know what motives animate them.I know, in part, what the Express will have to meet--and how to
meet it."Both men stared at her in blank amazement.Haynerd's jaw dropped as he
gazed.He had had a long apprenticeship in the newspaper field, but
never would he have dared attempt what this fearless girl had just
done."I have found out what news is," Carmen resumed."It is wholly _a
human invention_!It is the published vagaries of the carnal mind.In
the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming report of the
tragedies of sin.Fallom if he knew anything about mental
laws, and the terrible results of mental suggestion in his paper's
almost hourly heralding of murder, theft, and lust.But he only
laughed and said that the lurid reports of crime tended to keep people
alive to what was going on about them.He couldn't see that he was
making a terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so
constantly before an ignorant, credulous world's eyes that little else
could be seen.The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!"asked Haynerd, not believing that she would
have dared visit that journalistic demon."Yes," answered the girl, to his utter astonishment.Adams said
he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or petticoat sophistry.He
was in the business of collecting and disseminating news, and he
wanted that news to go _shrieking_ out of his office!You can see how the report of an Italian
wife-murder shrieks in red letters an inch high on the very first
page.Or has
he further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?""The people want it, Carmen," said Hitt slowly, though his voice
seemed not to sound a real conviction."If the church and the
press were not mortally and morally blind, they would see the deadly
destruction which they are accomplishing by shrieking from pulpit and
sanctum: 'Evil is real!Pietro Lasanni cuts his wife's throat!"But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must be
admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer, reads his
yellow journal avidly, and--"

"Yes, he does," returned the girl.The average man, as
you call him, is a victim of _the most pernicious social system
ever devised by the human mind_!Swept along in the mad rush of
commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless wheels, his
jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry out for artificial
stimulation, for something that will for a moment divert his wearied
thought from his hopeless situation.The Church offers him little
that is tangible this side of the grave.But whiskey, drugs, and
yellow journalism do.Hitt--can't you, Ned--that
the world's cry for sensationalism is but a cry for something that
will make it forget its misery for a brief moment?The average man
feels the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon which to
rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying.He cares little about a
promised life beyond the grave.He wants help here and now to solve
his problems.Little beyond a recount
of his own daily miseries, and reports of graft and greed, and
accounts of vulgar displays of material wealth that he has not and
can not have.And these reports divert his jaded mind for a moment and
give him a false, fleeting sense of pleasure--and then leave him
sunk deeper than before in despair, and in hatred of existing
conditions!""The girl is right," said Hitt, turning to Haynerd."And we knew it,
of course.This steam-calliope
age reflects the human-mind struggle for something other than its own
unsatisfying ideas.It turns to thrills; it expresses its restlessness
and dissatisfaction with itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called;
by the rattle and vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that
insult every sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous  supplements and spine-thrilling
tales.But the publisher himself--well, he
battens materially, of course, upon the tired victims of our degrading
social system.He sees but the sordid revenue in dollars and cents."And they can't," said Haynerd."Decent journalism wouldn't
pay--doesn't--never did!Other papers have tried it, and miserably
failed!""Then," returned Hitt calmly, after a moment's reflection, "oil will
meet the deficit.As long as my paternal wells flow in Ohio the
Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified, law-supporting
purveyor to a taste for better things--even if it has to create that
taste.Its columns will be closed to salacious sensation, and its
advertising pages will be barred to vice, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs.""And now we've got to get right down to
business.""Just so," said Hitt, rising."It is my intention to issue the Express
one more week on its present basis, and then turn it into a penny
morning daily.I'm going to assume the management myself, with you, Carmen, as
my first assistant."But, first, how far may
I go?""The limit," replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together."You are my
brain, so to speak, henceforth.As to financial resources, I am
prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars right into the Express
before a cent of revenue comes back.""Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?""For a while, yes," he said."We'll see how it works, for I have some
ideas to try out.""Well, then," resumed the girl eagerly, "I want this paper to be for
_all_ the people; to be independent in the truest sense of the term;
and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political and religious
sectarianism--you'll soon enough learn what that will cost you--to be
an active, constructive force in this great city, and a patient,
tireless, loving educator."grunted Haynerd, although he was listening very carefully."The Express will succeed," the girl went on, without noticing him,
"because our thought regarding it is successful._We_ have already
succeeded; and that success will be externalized in our work.It makes
no difference what the people may think of _us_; but it makes a lot of
difference what _we_ think of _them_ and _ourselves_.We assume superiority over adverse conditions, and we
claim success, because we know that these things are mental, and that
they are divinely ours.Lot's wife didn't have the sort of confidence
that wins--she looked back.But
there is no doubt of the outcome.And so there is no doubt lurking in
us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?The thought regarding
the Express has not been timidly born within us; it has come forth
flashing vigor!Yes it has, Ned, despite your doubts!And we have
within us a power mightier than any force outside of us.That is the
knowledge of infinite mind's omnipotence, and our ability to use the
Christ-principle to meet _every_ problem.Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.Hitt
smiled and nodded to Carmen.The girl went on rapidly and eagerly:

"We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint, aren't
we?We are not going on the assumption that the report of mankind's
errors is the report of real news.The only thing that is really new
is _good_.Adams's office two
items came in over the 'phone.One was the report of a jewel robbery,
and the other was an announcement of the draining by the Government of
submerged lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms.Adams put in bold type on
the front page?I was unable to locate the latter
anywhere in the paper, although it was a timely bit of news.""Now another thing," continued the girl, "I want the Sunday edition of
the Express to contain a resume of the important and vital news of the
week, with the very clearest, most impartial and enlightening
editorial comment upon it.This calls for nice discrimination in the
selection of those items for our comment.It means, however, the best
practical education for the people.This was John Ruskin's idea, and
certainly is a splendid one.Still another thing, the Express will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage."It is the women who will clean up
and regenerate this world, not the men.Reform is now in the hands of
the women.And India proves that
backward women mean a backward nation.""Then," continued Carmen, "make a distinct Women's Department in the
Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.""A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants, giving
them every possible aid in suggestions regarding their naturalization,
the languages, hotels, boarding houses, employment, and so on.""The Express is going to maintain a social service, and night schools.It is going to establish vacation and permanent homes for girls.It is
going to provide for vocational training.It is going to establish a
lecture bureau--for lectures on _good_.It is going to build a model
city for workingmen.Then it is going to found a model city for
everybody.It is going to establish clubs and meeting places for
workingmen, places where they may meet, and play games, and read, and
have social intercourse, and practical instruction.It is going to
establish the same for young boys.It is going to take the lead for
civic betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for--"

By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment at
the girl."Aren't you wandering
somewhat beyond strict newspaper limits?"And haven't I told you," returned the girl promptly, "that the only
thing new in this world is _good_?Our news is going to be _good_
news--the collection and dissemination of _good_ to all mankind.People who read our paper will no longer feel that it is dangerous to
be alive, but a glorious privilege.Hitt said I could go the limit, you know."Hitt had caught the girl's infectious enthusiasm, and his face was
beaming."It's your unlimited thought, Carmen, that
we old dry-bones want!What is anything in this life, compared with real
service to our fellow-men?_The Express is not in business to make
money!_ It is in the business of collecting and scattering the news of
good.Its dividends will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind.For _good is the greatest success there
is_!"It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the girl's
words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not.But her boundless
enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their souls, and they
ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay?The broader outlook was
already beginning to return profits to these men, as the newer
definition of 'news' occupied their thought.Seizing their hats, they bade Carmen go with them to inspect the plant
of the Express, and meet its staff."There's a question I'd like to ask," said Haynerd, as they pursued
their way toward their recent purchase."I want to know what our
editorial policy will be.Do we condone the offenses of our grafters
and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding their crimes?"We will let their guilt expose and kill itself," quickly returned
Carmen.A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden offices of the
Express.Hitt's spirits sank again as he looked about him.But Carmen
seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.After a mental appraisal of
the dingy, uninviting environment she exclaimed: "Well, one nice thing
about this is that we don't have much to start with!"Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.It was evident that the sale of
his plant had removed a heavy load from his shoulders."My best reporter was out yesterday when you called," he said,
addressing Hitt."He--well, he was a little the worse for wear.Come into my office and I'll send for him."In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the editor's
summons.He must have been well under twenty, thought Hitt, marveling
that so young a man should be regarded as Carlson's best news
gatherer.But his wonder grew apace when the editor introduced him as
Mr.The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen, and
addressed his reply to her."My governor," he said laconically.returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious group."The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.Has something
of his father's terrible energy.He used to come down here before his father threw him out.I
let him write little articles for the Express when he was barely
sixteen years old; and they were mighty good, too.But he got mixed up
in some scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off.The boy always did drink,
I guess.But since his family troubles he's been on the straight road
to the insane asylum."His father is no
friend of mine, and--"

"We _shall_ keep him," calmly interrupted Carmen."His father is a
_very_ good friend of mine."Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically."Well," squinting over his glasses at the girl, "this surely is
woman's era, isn't it?"*       *       *       *       *

A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean, fresh
type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well written
editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into the already
crowded metropolitan field.Adams picked it up and
laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh.Fallom glanced over it and
wondered.J. Wilton Ames, who had been apprised of its advent, threw
it into the waste basket--and then drew it out again.He re-read the
editorial announcing the policy of the paper.From that he began a
careful survey of the whole sheet.His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza.His lip curled, but he read
the article through, and finished with the mental comment that it was
well written."I want this sheet carefully watched," he commanded, tossing the paper
to his secretary."If anything is noticed that in any way refers to me
or my interests, call my attention to it immediately."A moment afterward Henry Claus,
nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests, was ushered in.cried the newcomer, rushing
forward and clasping the financier's hand."The city council last
night voted against the neighborhood saloon license bill!"Yes," commented the laconic Ames."Our aldermen are a very
intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus.They're wise enough to see that
their jobs depend upon whiskey.It requires very astute statesmanship,
Claus, to see that.But some of our congressmen and senators have
learned the same thing."The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched his head."Well," continued Ames, "have you your report?""Sales
less than last month," he remarked dryly."It's the local option law what done it, Mr.Ames," replied the brewer
apologetically."Them women--"

"Bah!Let a few petticoats whip you, eh?But, anyway, you don't know
how to market your stuff.Look here, Claus, you've got to encourage
the young people more.We've got to get the girls and boys.If we get
the girls, we'll get the boys easily enough.It's the same in the
liquor business as in certain others, Claus, you've got to land them
young."Ames, I can't take 'em and pour it down their throats!""You could if you knew how," returned Ames.if I had
nothing else to do I'd just like to devote myself to the sales end of
the brewing business.I'd use mental suggestion in such a way through
advertising that this country would drown in beer!Beer is just plain
beer to you dull-wits.But suppose we convinced people that it was a
food, eh?Advertise a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has
greater nutriment than beef.Catch the clerks and poor stenographers
that way.Don't call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that.Why, we couldn't begin to supply the demand!""Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the country;
electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures--never thought of that,
did you?And samples--why, I'd put samples into every house in the
Union!I'd give away a million barrels of beer--and sell a hundred
million as a result!But I'd work particularly with the young people.Work on them with literature and suggestion; they're more receptive
than adults.The hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising,
Claus, is simply omnipotent!"We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr.You can
afford to pass it up.It's run by a college professor and a doll-faced
girl."Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the publishers
of the Express called a meeting of the managers of all the other city
papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising, and that since then
the rates have gone up, way up!You see, the example set by the
Express may--"

"Humph!"An example, backed by
absolute fearlessness--and he knew from experience that the publishers
of the Express were without fear--well, it could not be wholly
ignored, even if the new paper had no circulation worth the name.Ames," resumed the brewer, "the Express is in every newsstand in
the city.It's in every hotel, in every
saloon, in every store and business house here.It
isn't sold, it's given away!"Leave it to me, Claus," he said at length, dismissing the brewer."I'll send for you in a day or so."*       *       *       *       *

It was well after midnight when the little group assembled in the
dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their interrupted
discussions.Hitt and Haynerd were the last to arrive.With him had come, not without
some reluctance, his prickly disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and
another friend and colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these
unique gatherings had been aroused by Morton."I've tried to give him a resume of our previous deductions," the
latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion."And he
says he has conscientious scruples--if you know what that means.""He's a Philistine, that's all, eh?""I am like my friend, Reverend Edward
Hull, who says--"

"There!""Your friend has a life job molding the
plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he doesn't want to lose
the sinecure.Got a wife and babies depending on
him.He still preaches hell-fire and the resurrection of the flesh,
doesn't he?Well, in that case we can dispense with his views, for
we've sent that sort of doctrine to the ash heap."Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt prevented
him by taking the floor and plunging at once into his subject."The
hour is very late," he said in apology, "and we have much ground to
cover.Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the Beaubien's."As I sat in my office this morning," began Hitt meditatively, "I
looked often and long through the window and out over this great,
roaring city.Everywhere I saw tremendous activity, frantic hurry, and
nerve-racking strife.In the distance I marked the smoke curling
upward from huge factories, packing houses, and elevators.The
incessant seething, the rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and
dust, all spelled business, an enormous volume of human business--and
yet, _not one iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual
nature and needs of mankind_!And then I looked down, far down, into the
streets below.And I saw,
too, men and women, rich and comfortable, riding along happily in
their automobiles, with not a thought beyond their physical
well-being.But, I asked myself, should they not ride thus, if they
wish?And yet, the hour will soon come when sickness, disaster, and
death will knock at their doors and sternly bid them come out."Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever you advanced
your philosophical theories, Doctor," said Reverend Moore, turning to
Morton.The doctor glowered back at him without reply."Now what should the man in the automobile do?Is there anything he
_can_ do, after all?Jesus told such as he to seek
first the kingdom of harmony--a demonstrable understanding of truth.The automobile riding would follow after that, and with safety.Why,
oh, why, will we go on wasting our precious time acquiring additional
physical sensations in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere
and everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real
knowledge which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!""Jesus set us free, sir," interposed Reverend Moore sternly."And his
vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to all who believe
on his name."Moore, you believe will be acquired only after
death.At present we see mankind laboring for that which even they
themselves admit is not meat.They waste their substance for what is
not bread.Because of their false beliefs of God and man,
externalized in a viciously cruel social system; because of their
dependence upon the false supports of _materia medica_, orthodox
theology, man-devised creeds, and human opinions."And yet, who hath believed our report?men in our
day think and read little that is serious; and they reflect hardly at
all upon the vital things of life.They want to be let alone in their
comfortable materialistic beliefs, even though those beliefs rend
them, rive them, rack and twist them with vile, loathsome disease, and
then sink them into hideous, worm-infested graves!The human mind does
not want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged.It does not want the
light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views which it has
accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.Because,
my friends, the human mind is inert, despite its seemingly tremendous
material activity.And its inertia is the result of its own
self-mesmerism, its own servile submission to beliefs which, as
Balfour has shown, have grown up under every kind of influence except
that of genuine evidence.Chief of these are the prevalent religious
beliefs, which we are asked to receive as divinely inspired."But that
gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon his sharp
features."Religion," continued Hitt, "is that which binds us to the real.what a farce mankind have made of it.Because, in its mad
desire to make matter real and to extract all pleasures from it, the
human mind has tried to eliminate the soul.""We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that's true,"
interposed Doctor Morton."Well," Hitt replied, "perhaps so.Yet almost in our own day France
put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned a prostitute as
the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible through the streets of
Paris, tied to the tail of an ass!And in this country we have enthroned so-called physical
science, and, as Comte predicted, are about to conduct God to the
frontier and bow Him out with thanks for His provisional services.As our droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, 'Once
man was a spirit, now he is matter.Once he was a flame, now he is a
candlestick.Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.'""But," exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, "that is because of
his falling away from the Church--"

"My friend," said Hitt calmly, "he fell away from the Church because
he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.Orthodox theology
has largely become mere sentimentalism.The average man has a horror
of being considered a namby-pamby, religiously weak, wishy-washy,
so-called Christian.It makes him ashamed of himself to stand up
in a congregation and sing 'My Jesus, I love Thee,' and 'In
mansions of glory and endless delight.'And he is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow
and next month's rent than he is about celestial mansions.No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards as the
weaker sex.He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of human science--and,
poor fool!Well, how
often nowadays do you hear the name of God on their lips?Is He ever the topic of conversation at
receptions and balls?No; that person was right who said that
religion 'does not rise to the height of successful gossip.'It
stands no show with the latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt,
and the daringly salacious drama as a theme of discourse.Oh, yes,
we still maintain our innumerable churches.And, though religion is
the most vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk
to us once a week about it!Would we hire men to talk once a week to
us about business?But religion is far, far less important to
human thought than business--for the latter means automobiles and
increased opportunities for physical sensation."Hitt," objected Doctor Siler, "I am sure this is not such a
godless era as you would make out.""We have many gods, chief of whom is matter.The
world's acknowledged god is not spirit, despite the inescapable fact
that the motive-power of the universe is spiritual, and the only
action is the expression of thought."But now," he continued, "we have in our previous discussions made
some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion that there is
a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.But, having agreed upon
that, are we now ready to admit the logical corollary, namely, that
there can be but _one_ real mind?For that follows from the premise
that there is but one God who is infinite.""We have but the one mind, God," he replied.Human men reflect the communal mortal
mind, which is the suppositional opposite of the divine mind that is
God.I repeat, the so-called human mind knows not God.It sees only its own interpretations of Him
and His manifestations."Well, they might be," suggested Doctor Siler."Well then," he said, "if you will not admit that all
things are mental--including the entire universe--you certainly are
forced to admit that your comprehension of things is mental.""Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned with
_things_, but with your comprehension of things.""And so, after all, you deal only with mental things--and everything
is mental to you.""The Bible states clearly that He created _all_ things," returned that
gentleman a little stiffly."My friends," resumed Hitt very earnestly, "we are on the eve of a
tremendous enlightenment, I believe.And for that we owe much to the
so-called 'theory of suppositional opposites.'We have settled to our
satisfaction that, although mankind believe themselves to be dependent
upon air, food, and water for existence, nevertheless they are really
dependent upon something vastly finer, which is back of those things.That'something' we call God, for it is good.Matthew Arnold said that
the only thing that can be verified about God is that He is 'the
eternal power that makes for righteousness.'Very well, we are almost
willing to accept that alone--for that carries infinite implications.It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent as an influence
for good.It makes Him the infinite patron, so to speak, of
right-thinking.So it makes Him
the sole creative force."But," he continued, "force, or power, is not material.God by very
necessity is mind, including all intelligence.And His operations are
conducted according to the spiritual law of evolution.Oh, yes,
evolution is not a theory, it is a fact.God, infinite mind, evolves,
uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless eternal ideas.The greatest of these is the one that
includes all others and expresses and reflects Him perfectly.That is the man who was'made'--revealed, manifested--in
His image and likeness.There is no other image and likeness of God.Moreover, God has always existed, and always will.So His ideas,
including real man, have had no beginning.They were not created, as
we regard creation, but have been unfolded.But now we come to the peculiar part,
namely, the fact that _reality seems always to have its shadow in
unreality_.The magnet has
its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.At the lowest ebb of the
world's morals appeared the Christ.The Christian religion springs
from the soil of a Roman Emperor's blood-soaked gardens.Errors hampering the solving of
mathematical problems.That
which stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer."And now we learn that it is the _communal mortal mind_ that stands as
the opposite and negative of the infinite mind that is God, and that
it is but a supposition, without basis of real principle or fact.It
has its law of evolution, too, and evolves its types in human beings
and animals, in mountain, tree, and stream.All material nature, in
fact, is but the manifestation, or reflection, of this communal mortal
mind."But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending, this
communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a seeming beginning,
and will end its pseudo-existence.It seemingly
evolved its universe, and its earth as its lower stratum.It made its
firmament, and it gradually filled its seas with moving things that
manifested its idea of life.Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of
time, it unrolled and evolved, until at last, through untold
generations of stupid, sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it
began to evolve a type of mind, a crude representation of the mind
that is God, and manifesting its own concept of intelligence."Now what was this communal mortal mind doing?Counterfeiting divine
mind, if I may so express it.But
types that were without basis of principle, and so they passed
away--the higher forms died, the lower disintegrated.Aye, death came
into the world because of sin, for the definition of sin is the
Aramaic word which Jesus used, translated '_hamartio_,' which means
'missing the mark.'Yes, sin came through Adam, for
Adam is the name of the communal mortal mind."Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind concept of
time.The evolution was continually toward a higher and ever higher
type.Paleolithic man still died, because he did not have enough real
knowledge in his mortal mind to keep him from missing the mark.He
probably had no belief in a future life, for he did not bury his dead
after the manner of those who later manifested this belief.But, after
the lapse of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a
belief.This: the mortal mind was translating the
divine idea of immortality into its own terms and thus expressing it.The curtain began to rise upon what we call human
history.The idea of a power not itself began to filter through the
mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt its influence, the
influence that makes for righteousness.And then, at last, through the
mortal mind there began to filter the idea of the one God.The people
who best reflected this idea were the ancient Israelites.They called
themselves the 'chosen' people.Their so-called minds were, as Carmen
has expressed it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others.They let a bit more of the light through.God is light,
you know, according to the Scriptures.And little by little they began
to record their thoughts regarding their concept of the one God.And soon they were seeing their God
manifested everywhere, and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature.And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, _the record of the evolution of the concept of God in
the human mind_.""Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?""This filtering process that I have been speaking
about _is_ inspiration.Every bit of truth that comes to you or me
to-day comes by inspiration--the breathing in--of the infinite mind
that is truth."And so," he went on, "we have those reflections of the communal
mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording their thoughts and
ideas.Sometimes they recorded plain fact; sometimes they wrapped
their moral teachings in allegories and fables.Josephus says of Moses
that he wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the
rest in plain words, since in his account of the first chapter of
Genesis and the first three verses of the second he gives no hint of
any mystery at all.But when he comes to the fourth verse of the
second chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the second
and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical sense.Quite
so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he was, was then
attempting the impossible task of explaining the enigma of evil, the
origin of which is associated always with the dust-man.""You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given in the
second chapter of Genesis, do you?""You deny
that man was tempted and fell?""Well," said Hitt, smiling, "of course there is no special reason for
denying that serpents may have talked, millions and millions of years
ago.In fact, they still have rudimentary organs of speech--as do most
animals.Snakes developed in the
Silurian Era, some twenty million years ago.In the vast intervening
stretch of time they may have lost their power to talk.But, as for
the second chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it.Indeed, he may not have written the first.The book of
Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several books by
various authors.I incline to the belief that some more materialistic
hand and mind than Moses's composed that second chapter.However that
may be, it is a splendid example of the human mind's crude attempt to
interpret the spiritual creation in its own material terms.It in a
way represents the dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the
spiritual creation.For when finite sense approaches the infinite it
must inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack of a
knowledge of the infinite principle involved.That's why the world
rejected the first account of the creation and accepted the second,
snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all."exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape."You're like a
story-book!"We know that man appeared on this
earth in comparatively recent times.For millions and millions of
years before he was evolved animals and vegetables had been dying."Your difficulty arises from the fact that
we are accustomed to associate sin with human personality.But
remember, the physical universe has been evolved from the communal
mortal mind.It has been dying from
the very beginning of its seeming existence, for its seeming existence
alone is sin.The vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have
been evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which they
evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle, God.And so
it and they miss the mark, and always have done so.You must cease to
say, Whose sin?Remember that the sin is inherent in the so-called
mind that is expressed by things material.The absence of the
principle which is God is sin, according to the Aramaic word,
translated '_hamartio_,' which Jesus used.The most lowly cell that
swam in the primeval seas manifested the communal mortal mind's sin,
and died as a consequence.""In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to truth?""Its existence was quite suppositional," replied Hitt."It did not
manifest life, but a material sense of existence.And so the communal mortal mind,
so-called, determined these first lowly material and objective forms
of existence.They were its phenomena, and they manifested it.Different types now manifest it, after long ages.But all are equally
without basis of principle, all are subject to the mortal law that
everything material contains within itself the elements for its own
destruction, and all must pass away.In our day we are dealing with
the highest type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man.He,
too, knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of
existence.His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity.The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him his sense of
time.The positing of his mental concepts give him his sense of space.His consciousness is a thought-activity, externalizing human opinions,
ideas, and beliefs, not based on truth.This consciousness--or
supposititious human mind--is very finite in nature, and so is
essentially self-centered.It attributes its fleshly existence to
material things.It believes that its life depends upon its fleshly
body; and so it thinks itself in constant peril of losing it.It goes
further, and believes that there are multitudes of other human minds,
each having its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each
capable of doing it and one another mortal injury.It believes that it
can be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it needs
for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status at their
expense, and vice versa.It is filled with fears--not knowing that God
is infinite good--and its fears become externalized as disaster, loss,
calamity, disease, and death at last.It has no basis of principle to rest upon, and so it
constantly shifts and changes to accord with its own shifting thought.It is here to-day, and gone
to-morrow.""Well, Ned," said Hitt, "there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something.It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite manifestation.The human
mind still translates or interprets God's greatest idea, Man, as 'a
suffering, sinning, troubled creature,' forgetting that this creature
is only a mental concept, and that the human mind is looking only at
its own thoughts, and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God's
real thoughts."Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not even begin to
grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated the mist of error.There is a spark of real reflection in every mortal.That spark can be
made to grow into a flame that will consume all error and leave the
real man revealed, a consciousness that knows no evil.There is now
enough of a spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to
enable it to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself.And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said.If he had not come we wouldn't
have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.""Well," observed Haynerd, "after that classification I don't see that
we mortals have much to be puffed up about!""All human beings, or mortals, Ned," said Hitt, "are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind's idea of itself, Man.These
interpretations are made in the human mind, and they remain posited
there.All are false,
and doomed to decay.How, then, can one mortal look down with
superciliousness upon another, when all are in the same identical
class?"Carmen's thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless existence
of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her life in the shifting
sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys."Now," resumed Hitt, "we will come back to the question of progress.What is progress but the growing of the human mind out of itself under
the influence of the divine stimulus of demonstrable truth?And that
is made possible when we grasp the stupendous fact that the human,
mortal mind, including its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent!The human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its lower
stratum, or expression, the body.For that reason he need not carry
over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were manifested by him
yesterday.If he leaves them in the past, they cease to be manifested
in his present or future.Then, opening
himself to truth, he lays off the 'old man' and puts on the 'new.'He
denies himself--denies that there is any truth in the seeming reality
of the mortal, material self--as Jesus bade us do."His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must always have existed.He, as mind, is an inexhaustible
reservoir of thought.Now the human, mortal mind interprets His
thoughts, and so _seems_ to manufacture new thought.It makes new
interpretations, but not new thoughts.When you hear people chatting,
do you think they are manufacturing new thought?They
are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called mortal mind's
interpretations of God's innumerable and real thoughts.""And so," suggested Father Waite, "the more nearly correct our
interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we approach to
righteousness.""There exist all sorts of real thoughts
about God's ideas.But the human mind
makes likewise all sorts of erroneous translations of them.We shall
solve our problem of existence when we correctly interpret His
thoughts, and use them only.When the human mentality becomes attuned
or accustomed to certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from
the communal mortal mind.Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines.Their minds are set in that direction,
and invite such a flow of thought.But were they to reverse the'set,'
there would be a very different and better resulting externalization
in health, prosperity, and morals.""I think I see," said Miss Wall."And I begin to glimpse the true
mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything for it."And now a word further about the so-called mortal mind.For,
when we have collected and arranged all our data regarding it, we will
find ourselves in a position to begin to work out of it, and thereby
truly work out our salvation, even if with fear and trembling.I have
said in a previous talk that, judging by the deductions of the
physical scientists, everything seems about to leave the material
basis and turn into vibrations, and'man changes with velocity' of
these.They tell us that all life depends upon water; that life began,
eons ago, in the primeval sea.True, the human sense of existence, as
I have said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called.And that sense of existence most
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind.Bichat has said
that 'life is the sum of the forces that resist death.'Spencer has
defined life as the 'continuous adjustment of internal to external
relations.'Very good, as applied to the human sense of life.The
human mind makes multitudes of mental concepts, and then struggles
incessantly to adjust itself to them, and at length gives up the
struggle, hopelessly beaten.Scientists tell us that life is due to a
continuous series of bodily ferments.The body is in a constant state
of ferment, and that gives rise to life.We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment.The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material thought.And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in its concept of body,
and its material environment.The scientists themselves are rapidly
pushing matter back into the realm of the human mind.Bodily states
are becoming recognized as manifestations of mental states--not vice
versa, as has been ignorantly believed for ages.A prominent physician
told me the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration now
could be directly traced to selfishness.We know that hatred and anger
produce fatal poisons.The rattlesnake is a splendid example of that.I am told that its poison and the white of an egg are formed of
_exactly the same amounts of the same elements_.The difference in
effect is the thought lying back of each.""You don't pretend that the snake
thinks and hates--"

"Doctor," said Hitt, "for thousands upon thousands of years the human
race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts toward the snake.Is
it any wonder that the snake is now poisonous?That it now reflects
back that poisonous thought to mankind?""But some are not poisonous, you know.""Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon our hatred
will make them all poisonous?Do you know, moreover, that sorrow,
remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect the perspiration that exudes
from the human body?Do you know that hatred will render human
perspiration the deadliest poison known to science?I am told that
in a few minutes of murderous hatred enough of this poisonous
perspiration is exuded from the human body to kill a man.And do
you know that the thought which manifests upon the body in such
deadly poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being?Think what the Church's deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!Why, millions
have been killed by it alone!"But now," he said, consulting his watch, "I must go.Even a newspaper
man requires a little sleep.And I must make my apology for occupying
the floor to-night to the exclusion of you all.I have gradually been
filling up with these thoughts for some weeks, and I had to let them
out.Hitt," interrupted Father Waite, "I shall soon be ready to report
on those questions of Bible research which you assigned to me.""Well, have you found that Jesus really was
an historical character, or not?""I think," said Carmen, "that he has found that it really matters
little whether there ever was such a person as the human man Jesus.The Christ has always lived; and the Christ-principle which the man
Jesus is reported to have revealed to the world is with us, here, now,
and always.It is the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that
concerns us, is it not?""Miss Carmen," interposed Reverend Moore, "Jesus was the incarnate Son
of God, and your remarks concerning him are--"

"Slow up, Pat!""I'll fight that out with
you on the way home."We will take up that question in our next discussion," said Hitt."But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before we part."As she passed Hitt, she
squeezed his hand.A few minutes later the little group dispersed,
with the melody of the girl's voice trembling in their souls.CHAPTER 8


For several days Ames reflected, and waited.Judging by the data which
he was able to secure, the Express was eating up money at a fearful
pace.To continue at that rate meant certain financial disaster in the
near future.And yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed
never to count the cost of their experiment.Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field.To survive the long period necessary for the education of the
public taste to such things as the Express stood for demanded a source
of income no less permanent than La Libertad itself.The Beaubien, of course, in her
crippled financial condition was affording the Express no monetary
assistance.Haynerd's few thousands were long
since dissipated.And
her estate was handled by Ames and Company!And handled, we may add,
in such a manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside spring.And as he meditated upon the new paper and its
promoters, there gradually formed within him a consuming desire to see
again the fair young girl who had drawn him so strongly, despite his
mountainous wrath and his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly
faced him in his own house on the night of his grand reception.Why
had he let her escape him then?True, women had
meant little to him, at least in the last few years.But this girl had
seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those long slumbering.He
knew not, coarsely materialistic as was his current thought, that in
him, as in all who came within the radius of her pure affection, she
had swept chords whose music he had never heard before.And then one morning he took down
the receiver and called up the office of the Express.Hitt was not there--but this was his assistant.And:

"You didn't want to see Mr.Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment.In the first
place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second, he was not
accustomed to being told that he might go to see people--they came
cringing to him."You may come at twelve-fifteen," continued the clear, firm voice."And remain a half hour; I'm very busy."Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful that no one
was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may
